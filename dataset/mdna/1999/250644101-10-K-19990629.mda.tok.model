sales to ras and seriee were approximately  in fiscal sales were also impacted by lower than anticipated sales to one of the company s major customers and the acquisition of two of the company s customers by other businesses 
the company has been able to offset  in part  the declines in sales to those customers with increased sales to a broader base of customers

the increase in production expenses was primarily due to the increase in net sales 
the increase in production expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to acquisitions of redistributor businesses during fiscal and unexpected manufacturing inefficiencies 
the lower margin earned by the company s acquisitions is reflective of the fact that margins associated with the product redistribution business are typically lower than margins associated with the sale of proprietary product

net interest expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding balance of debt in fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted from the company s international expansion and higher inventory levels 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to an effective rate of in fiscal the effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by non deductible goodwill  and the elimination of research and development credits 
liquidity and capital resources the company considers liquidity to be its ability to meet its long and short term cash requirements 
prior to  those requirements were primarily met by cash generated by the company s operating activities and cash reserves 
since the implementation of the company s strategy designed to enhance its product offerings  manufacturing capacity and international operations  particularly its acquisitions and the development of the asia facility  the company has required external sources of financing to satisfy its liquidity needs 
during fiscal  the company s operating activities provided  of operating cash flow 
net income  depreciation and amortization provided  a decrease in inventories provided  a decrease in accounts payable used  and a decrease in accounts receivable provided  other account changes provided  of operating cash flow 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities was  this related to the acquisitions of efsec and alarm center and capital expenditures 
during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  primarily representing principal repayments of debt 
pursuant to the terms of the company s debt agreements  the company has certain ratios and covenants to maintain with respect to such items as working capital  funded debt and fixed charges 
failure to comply with these guidelines constitutes a default and permits the lenders to cause the obligations to become currently due 
the company is in compliance with all covenants and requirements under the terms of the borrowing agreements 
capital resources 
on march   the company had cash balances of  on that date  the company had a  revolving credit facility that was not drawn 
this credit facility bears interest based upon either the federal funds rate  the prime rate or libor  each adjusted by a factor which varies based upon the rates of funded debt to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  and matures on july  the company expects to continue its pursuit of acquisitions and the development of new products and markets 
significant expenditures will also include continued research and development investment in detection  control and communication projects 
the company also plans to continue its efforts to market its products internationally 
the company believes that the combination of its current cash balances  cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its planned operations during fiscal year the company has appointed a team to assess the impact of the year on its information systems  products  and business 
this team includes two members of senior management and is led by the vice president of operations 
to ensure year compliance  the company has established specific categories to be reviewed products 
the company places a high priority on ensuring its products are year ready 
the company has completed its review of all products that are manufactured domestically and at its asia manufacturing facility as well as products purchased for resale by its domestic businesses 
the company believes these products to be year compatible 
the company is completing its assessment of year compatibility of products manufactured and purchased for resale at its other foreign subsidiaries 
the company does not expect significant issues with year readiness of products sold by its foreign subsidiaries as products sold by the company generally do not use date information for calculations or comparisons 
manufacturing 
some of the tools and equipment hardware and software used to develop and manufacture the company s products are date sensitive 
the company believes that the date sensitive tools and equipment used by it to manufacture products are now year compatible 
as a result the company does not expect significant interruption to its manufacturing capabilities because of the failure of tools and or equipment 
non manufacturing business applications 
the company is in the process of fixing and testing all non manufacturing business applications such as core financial information and reporting systems  procurement  human resources payroll  factory applications  customer service systems  and revenue systems  and does not expect any significant year problems in this area 
the company s domestic business information systems required upgrades and enhancements to be made year compatible 
these upgrades have been made and are currently being tested 
necessary upgrades to other information technology infrastructure have been identified and remediation is in process 
testing of year upgrades is expected to be completed prior to the year most of the company s non us subsidiaries information systems require various degrees of upgrade or replacement to be capable of handling year issues excluding the hong kong subsidiary  which utilizes the company s domestic information system 
the company has purchased a new enterprise resource planning system capable of handling the year that is currently being implemented at its foreign subsidiaries 
this implementation is expected to be complete at all locations prior to december  the company expects to be capable of handling the year at all locations without significant interruption to business activity 
facilities and infrastructure 
the company has evaluated its facilities and infrastructure health  safety and environment systems  buildings  security alarms doors  desktop computers  networks to ensure they are year compatible 
upgrades are being implemented where needed and the company does not expect significant interruption to its operations because of year problems with its facilities and infrastructure 
logistics 
of importance to the company for year is the readiness of suppliers and the products the company procures from suppliers as well as customers and service providers 
the company has a comprehensive program to identify and obtain year information from its critical suppliers  customers and service providers 
the program includes awareness letters  questionnaires  and a review of year web sites 
the company has mailed a questionnaire to substantially all suppliers  customers and service providers regarding year readiness 
responses are currently being received and evaluated and no significant issues have been noted as of the date of this report 
if a supplier  customer or service provider is of concern regarding year readiness  the company will develop contingency plans to minimize the year risk 
the company estimates that its aggregate costs for year activities from through will be approximately  external costs incurred through march  were approximately  and primarily related to computer hardware and software 
it is anticipated that the remaining year costs will relate to computer software  computer hardware and consulting fees 
the company does not separately track internal costs relating to the year  and they are not included in the company s estimate of year costs 
these costs do not include estimates for potential litigation  which at the present time is not viewed as a significant risk 
the company reviews and updates data for costs incurred and forecasted costs each quarter 
these costs are based on management s estimates  which were determined based on assumptions of future events  some within the company s control  but some outside the company s control 
management s estimate of the costs and completion dates are dependent on various factors including the availability of skilled resources and the ability to locate and modify all relevant software code 
no amount of preparation and testing can guarantee year compliance 
nevertheless  the company recognizes that failing to resolve its year issues on a timely basis would  in a worst case scenario  significantly limit its ability to manufacture and distribute its products and process its daily business transactions for a period of time  especially if such failure is coupled with third party or infrastructure failures 
similarly  the company could be significantly affected by the failure of one or more significant suppliers  customer or components of the infrastructure to conduct their respective operations without interruption after because of the difficulty of assessing the year compliance of such third parties  the company considers the potential disruptions caused by such parties to present the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
adverse effects on the company could include business disruption  increased costs  loss of sales and other similar ramifications 
however  the company believes it is taking appropriate preventive measures and will be successful in avoiding any material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
euro conversion 
the company is assessing the potential impact that may result from the euro conversion in a number of areas  including the following accounting and tax  management information systems required to accommodate euro denominated transactions  the impact on currency exchange costs and currency exchange rate risk  and the impact on existing contracts 
dividend policy 
the company is dedicated to promoting shareholder value through long term profitability and growth and believes that continued investments in future product development are essential to this goal 
for this reason  it has been the company s policy not to pay cash dividends 
inflation 
during fiscal  and  inflation did not have a significant impact on the company s business  or results of operations
