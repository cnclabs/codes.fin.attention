future acquisition activities and any increases in marketing and research and development expenses over the present levels may require additional funds

year readiness disclosure many computer systems and embedded technologies may experience problems handling dates beyond the year and therefore may need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company is taking steps to ensure its readiness for handling dates beginning in the year the company completed the implementation of year readiness of its critical operational and administrative software during the month of august the company will continue to monitor its software vendors for additional changes that may affect year readiness  and will implement such changes  if required 
the company has formally communicated with all of its key suppliers to determine their year state of readiness and the extent to which the failure of any of their systems may impact the company s operations 
the communication and evaluation process is ongoing 
based upon current information  the company estimates that the costs of addressing the year issue have not been material and are expected to continue to be immaterial 
to the extent the company is uncertain as to any of its key suppliers year readiness  it may choose to increase key product inventories during to assure continuity of operations 
the company currently believes that it is difficult to identify our most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
however  a reasonable worst case scenario would be a failure by a significant third party in the supply and distribution chain to remediate its year deficiencies that would continue for several days or more 
any such failure could impair the manufacture and or delivery of products 
the company s year efforts are ongoing and the overall plan  as well as the company s development of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the company has no financial instruments that give it exposure to foreign exchange rates or equity prices 
the company s existing term loan with state street bank and trust company bears interest at a rate equal to the prime lending rate plus one percent 
as a result  the company does have exposure to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase by one percentage point from current levels  the company would incur incremental interest expense of thousand through the scheduled maturity of the term loan on february
