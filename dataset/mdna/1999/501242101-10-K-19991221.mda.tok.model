item business 
we design  manufacture and market capital equipment and packaging materials for sale to companies that manufacture and assemble semiconductor devices 
we also service  maintain  repair and upgrade assembly equipment 
today  we are the world s largest supplier of semiconductor assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is divided into three segments equipment  packaging materials and advanced packaging technology 
historically  the demand for semiconductors and our semiconductor assembly equipment has been volatile from period to period 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry began in fiscal and continued through the first half of fiscal  contributing to our net losses for fiscal years and the semiconductor industry began to rebound in the second half of  and we reported strong fourth quarter results  with net sales of million and net income of million  compared to net sales of million and a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of  and net sales of million and a net loss of million in the third quarter of kulicke and soffa industries  inc was incorporated in pennsylvania in our principal offices are located at blair mill road  willow grove  pennsylvania and our telephone number is products and services we offer a broad range of semiconductor assembly equipment  packaging materials  advanced packaging technologies and complementary services and spare parts used in the semiconductor assembly process 
set forth below is a table listing the approximate percentage of our net sales by principal product for our fiscal years ended september   and fiscal year ended september  wire bonders additional assembly equipment services and spare parts packaging materials advanced packaging technologies see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment 
wire bonders our principal product line is our family of wire bonders  which are used to connect extremely fine wires  typically made of gold or aluminum  between the bonding pads on the die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been bonded 
we offer both ball and wedge bonders in automatic and manual configurations 
ball bonders typically are used for leadframe based and laminate based packages  while wedge bonders typically are used for ceramic packages 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages based on high productivity and superior process control  enabling fine pitch bonding and long  low wire loops  which are needed to assemble advanced ic packages 
the selling prices for our automatic wire bonders range from  to over  and from  to  for manual wire bonders  in each case depending on system configuration and purchase volume 
our current generation of wire bonders  the family  is based on an entirely new platform and required us to develop new software and many subassemblies that were not part of our prior series of wire bonders 
the first products in the family were the model ball bonder and model wedge bonder 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we introduced the model ball bonder and began to shift production capacity from the model ball bonder 
by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the model accounted for the majority of ball bonders we sold due to its superior technical performance and productivity 
we continue to market the model wedge bonder  which we introduced during the fiscal fourth quarter and began shipping in volume in the first quarter of fiscal  the model  a large area wedge bonder we introduced during the first quarter of fiscal and the digital series of manual wire bonders 
we also continue to develop a new wire bonder platform to meet expected customer requirements 
as part of our strategy to reduce the manufacturing costs of our wire bonders  we plan to transfer our automatic ball bonder manufacturing from willow grove  pennsylvania to a  square foot facility in singapore 
we expect the singapore facility to be fully operational in late fiscal additional semiconductor assembly equipment in addition to wire bonders  we produce and distribute other types of semiconductor assembly equipment  including wafer dicing saws and die bonders  flip chip assembly systems and factory automation and integration systems 
dicing saws 
dicing saws use diamond embedded saw blades to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
we presently produce and market two dicing saws the model  an automatic dicing saw  and the model twin spindle dicing saw  which was introduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal these dicing saws range in price from to more than die bonders 
die bonders are used to attach a semiconductor die to a leadframe or other package before wire bonding 
we have a year distribution agreement with datacon semiconductor equipment gmbh  an austrian company  principally to market their multi chip module and flip chip die bonder product line worldwide  excluding europe 
the die bonders range in price from  to more than  depending on configuration 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began marketing the apm  an extremely accurate multi chip bonder developed by datacon 
we have received several orders for the apm 
flip chip assembly systems 
flip chip is an alternative assembly technique in which the die is inverted and attached to the package or board using conductive bumps  thereby eliminating the need for conventional die or wire bonding 
the model apm  manufactured by datacon semiconductor equipment gmbh and distributed by us  can be configured to support flip chip applications 
selling prices for flip chip applications exceed factory automation and integration systems 
factory systems include products and services designed to automate data collection and material flow between process steps in semiconductor assembly 
we are successfully marketing the knet  a pc based information management system  as well as several software products for factory simulation and lot management 
we also offer different configurations of some of our products for non semiconductor applications 
for instance  our model saw can be configured for cutting and grinding hard and brittle materials  such as ceramic  glass and ferrite  that are used in the fabrication of chip capacitors or disk drive heads 
packaging materials we offer a range of packaging materials to semiconductor device assemblers which we sell under the brand names american fine wire  micro swiss  semitec and advanced polymer solutions 
we have integrated these operating units with our equipment groups  and intend to expand this business in an effort to increase our revenues from materials used in the assembly of ics 
we also sell our packaging materials for use with competitors assembly equipment 
our principal packaging materials are bonding wire 
american fine wire is a manufacturer of very fine typically inches in diameter gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
american fine wire produces wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications 
expendable tools 
the micro swiss family of expendable tools includes capillaries  wedges  die collets  saw blades and microspheres 
capillaries and wedges are used to feed out  attach and cut the wires used in wire bonding 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages 
micro swiss brand hubless saw blades are used to cut hard and brittle materials 
semitec  which we acquired in october  manufactures hub blades that are used to cut silicon wafers into semiconductor die 
die attach adhesives 
advanced polymer solutions  a joint venture company that we established in the first quarter of fiscal with polyset  inc  currently offers two die attach adhesive formulations based on epoxy siloxane chemistry 
the first is a fast curing adhesive that can eliminate the need for oven curing  reducing handling and processing time during the assembly of semiconductors 
the second provides a high degree of moisture resistance for increased package reliability 
additional products planned for introduction in fiscal include flip chip underfills and liquid encapsulants 
services and spare parts we believe that our knowledge and experience have positioned us to deliver innovative  customer specific services that reduce the cost of owning our equipment 
historically  our offerings in this area were limited to spare parts  customer training and extended warranty contracts 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we are focusing on providing repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through a value added products and services organization 
these services are generally priced on a time and materials basis 
the service and maintenance arrangements are typically subject to bi annual or multi year contracts 
investment in advanced packaging technologies in february  we entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronics corporation to license flip chip technology and to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis through flip chip technologies  llc 
flip chip technologies intends to focus primarily on licensing its flip chip technology to customers 
as of september   flip chip technologies had sold one license and we expect it to sell additional licenses in fiscal in addition  flip chip technologies completed construction of its manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona during fiscal  has commenced production and currently is providing contract bump services to customers and is working with other customers to have its manufacturing processes qualified 
in march of  flip chip technologies introduced a new wafer level chip scale package  named the ultra csp tm  aimed at the chip scale packaging market 
a chip scale device has a surface area no larger than times the area of the die 
flip chip technologies ultra csp package has been qualified and is currently being shipped to customers 
on may   we increased our ownership interest in flip chip technologies to by converting all of our outstanding loans and accrued interest into equity units 
under various operating agreements  we manage flip chip technologies jointly with delco and have agreed not to compete with the joint venture 
flip chip technologies has also entered into various agreements with delco that are customary in similar joint venture arrangements 
we continuously evaluate investments in advanced packaging technologies 
to that end  in february  we acquired the x lam technology of micromodule systems tm  a cupertino  california company  to enable production of high performance ball grid array substrates  daughter cards and multi layer boards 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we leased a  square foot manufacturing research and development facility in milpitas  california and are building a staff to fully develop and market the technology 
to date our advanced packaging technology business has experienced losses 
we expect these losses to continue at least through fiscal customers our major customers include large semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide 
some of these major customers are advanced micro devices lucent technologies advanced semiconductor engineering micron technology amkor technologies motorola anam national semiconductor chippac orient semiconductor electronics fujitsu philips electronics ibm st microelectronics infineon technologies siliconware precision intel texas instruments sales to a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our net sales 
in fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of net sales  but in fiscal sales to intel accounted for of our net sales  and in fiscal sales to anam accounted for of our net sales and sales to intel accounted for of our net sales 
we believe that developing long term relationships with our customers is critical to our success 
by establishing these relationships with semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers  we gain insight into our customers future ic packaging strategies 
this information assists us in our efforts to develop material  equipment and process solutions that address our customers future assembly requirements 
international operations we sell our products to semiconductor device manufacturers and contract manufacturers  which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
approximately of our fiscal net sales  of our fiscal net sales and of our fiscal net sales were for delivery to customer locations outside of the united states 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  hong kong and japan 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
in addition  we maintain manufacturing operations in countries other than the united states  including operations located in israel  singapore and switzerland 
risks associated with our international operations include risks of foreign currency and foreign financial market fluctuations  international exchange restrictions  changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments  war  civil disturbances  expropriation  or other events which may limit or disrupt markets 
sales and customer support we established a single sales management team in the third quarter of fiscal to coordinate activities and improve customer support 
our direct sales force  consisting of approximately individuals at september   is responsible for the sale of all product lines  including those of our equipment  packaging materials and advanced packaging technology businesses  to customers in the united states and the asia pacific region  including japan 
lower volume product lines  as well as all equipment sales to customers in europe  are sold through a network of manufacturers representatives 
we believe that providing comprehensive worldwide sales  service  training and support are important competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment industry  and we have combined these functions into a customer operations group 
in order to support our us and foreign customers whose semiconductor assembly operations are located in the asia pacific region  we maintain a significant presence in the region  with sales facilities in hong kong  japan  korea  taiwan  malaysia  the philippines and singapore  a technology center in japan and application labs in singapore 
we also maintain customer resource centers in taiwan  the philippines and singapore 
we support our assembly equipment customers worldwide with over customer service and support personnel as of september   located in the united states  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and thailand 
our local presence in the asia pacific countries enables us to provide more timely customer service and support by positioning our service representatives and spare parts near customer facilities  and affords customers the ability to place orders locally and to deal with service and support personnel who speak the customer s language and are familiar with local country practices 
backlog at september   our backlog of orders approximated million  compared to approximately million at september  our backlog consists of product orders for which we have received confirmed purchase orders  and which are scheduled for shipment within months 
virtually all orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenues for any succeeding quarterly period 
manufacturing equipment 
our assembly equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of integrating components and subassemblies to create finished systems configured to customer specifications 
during fiscal  we performed system design  assembly and testing in house at our willow grove  pennsylvania and haifa  israel facilities  utilizing an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of many of our major subassemblies 
we believe that outsourcing enables us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and allows us to focus on product differentiation through system design and quality control 
our just in time inventory management strategy has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and limited our on hand inventory 
this strategy will continue at our new facility in singapore  sourced largely by local suppliers 
we have obtained iso certification for operations in our willow grove  pennsylvania facility and for our haifa  israel equipment manufacturing facility  and will apply for iso certification of our new facility in singapore 
packaging materials 
we manufacture our micro swiss expendable tools at our facility in yokneam  israel and our american fine wire product line  consisting of gold and aluminum bonding wire  at facilities in selma  alabama  singapore and thalwil  switzerland 
we manufacture our semitec hub blades in santa clara  california 
we manufacture our advanced polymer solutions adhesives in our willow grove  pennsylvania facility 
all three american fine wire facilities  as well as the semitec facility  have received iso certification and the micro swiss facility has received iso certification 
advanced packaging technology 
we also maintain manufacturing facilities in phoenix  arizona for flip chip technologies and in milpitas  california for our x lam technology 
research and product development because technological change occurs rapidly in the semiconductor industry  we devote substantial resources to our research and development programs to maintain our competitiveness 
we employed approximately individuals in research and development at september  we pursue the continuous improvement and enhancement of existing products while simultaneously developing next generation products 
for example  while the performance of current generations of wire bonders is being enhanced in accordance with a specific continuous improvement plan  we are simultaneously developing the next generation wire bonders 
much of the next generation equipment we are presently developing is based on modular  interchangeable subsystems  including the control platform  which we believe will promote more efficient and cost effective manufacturing operations  lower inventory levels  improved field service capabilities and shorter product development cycles  and allow us to introduce new products more quickly 
in fiscal  we introduced two new bonders based on technology developed for earlier models of the family  the model  an automatic ball bonder that offers increased accuracy and productivity over its predecessor  the model  and the model  which is used for large area ball bonding and wafer level ball bumping 
our net expenditures for research and development totaled approximately million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we have received funding from certain customers and government agencies pursuant to contracts or other arrangements for the performance of specified research and development activities 
such amounts are recognized as a reduction of research and development expense when specified activities have been performed 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  such funding totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
competition the semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries are intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include performance quality  customer support and price 
our major equipment competitors include o asm pacific technology  shinkawa  kaijo and esec in wire bonders  o esec  nichiden  asm pacific technology and alphasem in die bonders  and o disco corporation in dicing saws 
competitive factors in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include price  delivery and quality 
our significant packaging materials competitors with respect to expendable tools and blades include o gaiser tool co 
and small precision tools  inc in expendable tools  and o disco corporation in blades  and in the bonding wire market o tanaka electronic industries and sumitomo metal mining 
in each of the markets we serve  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  some of which may have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are japanese or korean companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers because many of these customers appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
we expect our competitors to improve their current products performance  and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by our competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales 
if a particular semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor s product for a particular assembly operation  we may not be able to sell a product to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time because manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relations with suppliers  and products in our industry often go years without requiring replacement 
in addition  we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete in these or other areas in the future 
intellectual property where circumstances warrant  we seek to obtain patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research  engineering and manufacturing activities 
we currently hold a number of united states patents some of which have foreign counterparts 
we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 
although the patents we hold and may obtain in the future may be of value  we believe that our success will depend primarily on our engineering  manufacturing  marketing and service skills 
in addition  we believe that much of our important technology resides in our proprietary software and trade secrets 
as long as we rely on trade secrets and unpatented knowledge  including software  to maintain our competitive position  there is no assurance that competitors may not independently develop similar technologies and possibly obtain patents containing claims applicable to our products and processes 
the sale of our products covered by such patents could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  although we execute non disclosure and non competition agreements with certain of our employees  customers  consultants  selected vendors and others  there is no assurance that such secrecy agreements will not be breached 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees 
in addition  we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third party waste disposal sites we use or have used 
these laws could impose liability even if we did not know of  or were not responsible for  the contamination 
we have in the past and will in the future incur costs to comply with environmental laws 
we are not  however  currently aware of any costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters  including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third party waste disposal sites  that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
it is possible  however  that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future 
employees at september   we had  permanent employees  temporary employees and contract personnel worldwide 
our only employees represented by a labor union are america fine wire s employees in singapore 
most of the employees at our new automatic ball bonder manufacturing facility in singapore will also be members of that union 
generally  we believe our employee relations to be good 
competition in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry is intense  particularly with respect to software engineering 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees

also  in october  we acquired american fine wire corporation through the acquisition of all of the common stock of circle s industries  inc  the parent corporation of american fine wire 
american fine wire is a manufacturer of fine gold and aluminum wire used in the wire bonding process 
in january  we purchased the x lam technology and fixed assets used in the design  development and manufacture of laminate substrates for million 
as a result of this purchase  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million for the writeoff of in process research and development 
during fiscal  we announced plans to relocate our automatic ball bonder manufacturing to singapore 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge for severance of approximately million for the elimination of approximately positions and asset writeoff costs of approximately million 
in fiscal  we also recorded approximately million for severance related to the reduction in workforce begun in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million for severance and product discontinuance as a result of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
of this amount million was associated with the equipment business  million with the packaging materials business and million was recorded in corporate expense 
during fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge in the equipment business of approximately million for severance and the writeoff of costs incurred in connection with the suspended willow grove facility expansion as a result of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
effective may  we increased our ownership interest in flip chip technologies  llc  from to by converting all of our outstanding loans to flip chip technologies and accrued interest totaling million into equity units 
we accounted for the increase in ownership by the purchase method of accounting and began consolidating the results of flip chip technologies into our financial statements on june  we recognized pre tax losses of approximately million  million  million and million  representing our share of the losses from our investment in flip chip technologies during fiscal   and  respectively 
our financial statements for fiscal reflect pre tax losses at flip chip technologies of million for the four months after we began reporting flip chip technologies on a consolidated basis and a loss of million for the eight months when flip chip technologies was accounted for by the equity method of accounting and reflected in equity in loss of joint ventures

overview we design  manufacture and market capital equipment and packaging materials for sale to companies that manufacture and assemble semiconductor devices 
we also service  maintain  repair and upgrade assembly equipment 
today  we are the world s largest supplier of semiconductor assembly equipment  according to vlsi research inc we sell our products to semiconductor device manufacturers and contract manufacturers  which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of net sales for fiscal and are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
to support our international sales  we currently have major manufacturing operations in the united states  israel and singapore  sales facilities in hong kong  japan  korea  taiwan  malaysia  the philippines and singapore  a technology center in japan and applications labs in singapore 
we also maintain customer resource centers in taiwan  the philippines and singapore 
our business is divided into the following three segments equipment through our equipment business we design  manufacture and market semiconductor assembly equipment 
our principal product line is our family of wire bonders  which are used to connect extremely fine wires  typically made of gold or aluminum  between the bonding pads on the die and the leads on the ic package to which the die has been bonded 
we are the world s largest manufacturer of wire bonders  according to vlsi 
in fiscal  we successfully introduced the model automatic ball bonder which  by the fourth quarter  accounted for the majority of ball bonders we sold due to its superior technical performance and productivity 
earlier in  we announced plans to relocate our automatic ball bonder manufacturing from the united states to singapore 
we expect the new manufacturing operation in singapore to be fully operational in late fiscal automatic ball bonders are our primary product and accounted for of our total sales in fiscal we anticipate cost savings as a result of this move from reductions in the cost of shipping  labor and production materials 
in addition  we expect to receive favorable tax treatment from singapore in connection with the move 
we incurred start up costs associated with the move of million in fiscal and expect additional start up costs in the first half of fiscal of approximately million 
packaging materials through our packaging materials business we design  manufacture and market a range of packaging materials to semiconductor device assemblers including very fine typically inches in diameter gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades 
we expect to expand this business in an effort to increase our revenues from materials used in the assembly of ics 
advanced packaging technology we established this business segment in fiscal to reflect the operating results of our strategic initiative to develop new technologies for advanced semiconductor packaging 
this new business unit is comprised of flip chip technologies  llc  a joint venture with delco electronics corporation  and our x lam business unit 
through flip chip technologies we license our flip chip technology and provide wafer bumping services 
on may   we increased our ownership interest in flip chip technologies from to by converting all of our outstanding loans and accrued interest  which totaled million  into equity units 
we accounted for the increase in ownership by the purchase method of accounting and began consolidating the results of flip chip technologies into our financial statements on june  for the first eight months of fiscal  we recognized of flip chip technologies pre tax loss and did not recognize interest income on loans to flip chip technologies due to the existence of these loans and uncertainties about flip chip technologies ability to obtain additional financing from delco and its ability to generate short term positive cash flow 
the pre tax loss of flip chip technologies for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal our share of the flip chip technologies pre tax loss  reflected in our financial statements  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million pre tax loss in fiscal consists of million of losses for the four months after we began reporting flip chip technologies on a consolidated basis after giving effect to delco s minority interest and the elimination of inter company interest  and a loss of million for the eight months when flip chip technologies was accounted for by the equity method of accounting and reflected in equity in loss of joint ventures 
we established our x lam business unit to develop  manufacture and market high density interconnect substrates using either flip chip or advanced wire bonding interconnection schemes 
we purchased the x lam technology for million in the second quarter of fiscal  have leased a research manufacturing facility and are building a staff to fully develop and market the technology 
in fiscal  we recorded an operating loss for the x lam business of million and a charge for the writeoff of in process research and development of million 
neither flip chip technologies nor x lam has been profitable to date 
with a full year of x lam operations in fiscal and our anticipated increased selling  general and administrative expenses and development spending  we expect losses at x lam to increase in fiscal we do not expect our x lam operations to generate any sales until fiscal the following table sets forth the percentage of our net sales from each business segment for the past three years fiscal year ended september  segment equipment packaging materials advanced packaging technology total net sales 
we recognize net sales upon the shipment of products or performance of services 
our equipment sales depend on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile and has experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment 
these downturns and slowdowns  coupled with the effect of the asian economic crisis  adversely affected our sales during the latter half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal however  the semiconductor business cycle appears to have turned up  as evidenced by our sales results in the fourth quarter of fiscal our packaging materials sales depend on the same semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers as our equipment sales 
however  the volatility in demand for our packaging materials is less than that of our equipment sales due to the consumable nature of the packaging materials 
we expect to expand this portion of our business to help offset the volatility of the equipment segment  and because the worldwide market for consumable packaging materials is larger than the market for our semiconductor assembly equipment 
our advanced packaging technology sales represent the sales from flip chip technologies for the four months that we reported the results of flip chip technologies on a consolidated basis 
we will report flip chip technologies sales on a consolidated basis in all twelve months of fiscal therefore  we expect our advanced packaging technology sales to be higher than in fiscal cost of goods sold 
our equipment cost of goods sold consists mainly of subassemblies  materials  direct and indirect labor costs and other overhead 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some material components 
packaging materials cost of goods sold consists primarily of gold  aluminum  direct labor and other materials used in the manufacture of bonding wire  capillaries  wedges and other company products  with gold making up the majority of the cost 
gold bonding wire is generally priced based on a fabrication charge per  feet of wire  plus the value of the gold 
to minimize our exposure to gold price fluctuations  we obtain gold for fabrication under a contract with our gold supplier and only purchase the gold when we ship and sell the finished product to the customer 
accordingly  fluctuations in the price of gold are generally absorbed by our gold supplier or passed on to our customers 
since gold makes up a significant portion of the cost of goods sold by the packaging materials segment  the gross profit margins will be lower than can be expected in the equipment business 
cost of goods sold in our advanced packaging technology segment is currently comprised of material  labor and overhead at flip chip technologies 
our x lam operations will not report cost of goods sold until they begin to generate revenues  which is expected to occur in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense is comprised primarily of personnel costs  professional costs  management information systems  facility and depreciation expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as we build the staff in the x lam operation  report the results of flip chip technologies on a consolidated basis for a full year and incur additional start up costs in singapore 
research and development expense 
our research and development costs consist primarily of labor  prototype material and other costs associated with our developmental efforts to strengthen our product lines and develop new products 
our research and development costs decreased in fiscal due to the reduction of our workforce in response to the market downturn 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in fiscal as the semiconductor business cycle improves  we devote a full year to building the x lam operation and we report the results of flip chip technologies on a consolidated basis for a full year 
results of operations the table below shows principal line items from our historical consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of our net sales  for the three years ended september  fiscal year ended september  net sales costs of goods sold gross margin selling general and administrative research and development  net resizing costs purchased in process research and development income loss from operations fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded bookings of million compared to million during fiscal the million increase in fiscal bookings occurred in the second half of fiscal and primarily reflected a significant improvement in demand for semiconductor assembly equipment 
at september   total backlog of customer orders approximated million compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
net sales for the fiscal year decreased by million to million from million in fiscal during the first half of fiscal  net sales totaled million  or million lower than the same six month period of fiscal  reflecting the impact of the slowdown in the semiconductor industry which started in however  as the semiconductor business cycle turned up in the second half of fiscal  net sales increased over the prior year in the third and fourth quarters by and  respectively 
net sales in our equipment segment decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower equipment segment sales were primarily due to significantly reduced demand for wedge bonders 
we sold wedge bonders in fiscal  a or million decline from the fiscal level 
this was partially offset by higher automatic ball bonder sales approximately  machines sold in fiscal versus approximately  machines sold in fiscal 
the increase in ball bonder sales primarily occurred in the second half of fiscal  reflecting the increased industry demand for semiconductor assembly equipment as well as the introduction of the new model ball bonder 
the lower equipment segment sales in fiscal also reflect reduced average selling prices for our model and model ball bonders partially offset by improved pricing for the model packaging materials segment net sales increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the higher packaging material segment net sales were due primarily to a higher volume of gold wire and capillary shipments during the second half of fiscal net sales of our new advanced packaging technology segment reflect the sales of flip chip technologies for the four months ended september  international sales shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of our total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  the philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong  accounted for approximately and of our total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  shipments to customers located in taiwan  singapore  the philippines and malaysia accounted for approximately   and of net sales  compared to   and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the lower volume of equipment segment sales in fiscal gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to lower gross profit margin in the equipment segment partially offset by higher gross profit margin in the packaging materials segment 
the gross profit margin in fiscal was also negatively impacted by a million negative gross profit recorded by our newly created advanced packaging technology segment 
the equipment segment gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to the lower average selling price for the segment s model and ball bonders due to pricing competition and higher manufacturing costs associated with the model and a sharp decline in sales of our higher margin wedge bonder 
the packaging materials segment gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to operating efficiencies resulting from the impact of cost improvement programs implemented in fiscal  the favorable impact of higher unit volumes of materials and higher margins on fine pitch products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million increase was due to million of expenses associated with our new advanced packaging technology business units and million of start up expenses for our new singapore manufacturing facility  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses in our equipment segment 
the lower selling  general and administrative expenses in our equipment segment were due to lower payroll and related costs resulting from our resizing efforts to reduce our workforce in late fiscal and early fiscal research and development costs decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
our lower research and development expense was due to lower payroll and related costs resulting from our efforts to reduce our workforce in late fiscal and early fiscal we focused our research and development efforts on new product introductions eg  the model ball bonder and new product development 
gross research and development expenditures were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we recorded resizing costs of million in fiscal reflecting provisions for severance and asset write off costs resulting from the announced move of our automatic ball bonder manufacturing to singapore and additional severance in connection with the reduction in our workforce 
at september   we had accrued liabilities of million in connection with these severance costs  the majority of which will be paid in fiscal we also recorded resizing costs of million in fiscal for severance  asset write offs and other costs in response to the industry wide slowdown in orders for semiconductor assembly equipment and to a lesser extent semiconductor packaging materials 
in january  we purchased the x lam technology and fixed assets used in the design  development and manufacture of laminate substrates for million 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million for in process research and development representing the appraised value of products still in the development stage that had not reached technological feasibility and an operating loss of million 
loss from operations in fiscal was million compared to a loss of million in fiscal the unfavorable variance in fiscal was due primarily to an operating loss at our equipment business of million compared to operating income of million in the prior year and a loss at our new advanced packaging technology business of million 
the operating loss in our equipment business was due to lower net sales and gross profit margin and one time charges for the move to singapore and workforce reductions 
the operating losses in our equipment and advanced packaging technology businesses were partially offset by an increase of million in operating income in the packaging materials business 
additionally  as described previously  we recorded a million write off of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of the x lam technology 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower short term investments resulting from the use of cash throughout fiscal to fund the net loss  working capital  capital expenditures and investments in new business initiatives 
see liquidity and capital resources 
equity in loss of joint ventures increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our share of the pre tax loss in flip chip technologies for the eight months ended may  was million versus million for all of in fiscal we recognized of the loss at flip chip technologies for the eight months ended may  compared to recognizing only of the flip chip technologies loss in fiscal  for reasons previously discussed 
during fiscal  we also recognized a million loss from our equity interest in advanced polymer solutions  llc  a joint venture established in fiscal to develop  manufacture and market advanced polymer materials for semiconductor and microelectronic packaging end users 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate of this benefit was 
we increased our valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards  and continue to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the acquired domestic american fine wire net operating loss and net operating loss carryforwards of our japanese subsidiary  because we cannot reasonably forecast sufficient future earnings by these subsidiaries to fully utilize the net operating losses during the carryforward period 
if we realize the benefits of the american fine wire acquired net operating loss carryforward  the benefits would reduce the recorded amount of american fine wire goodwill 
we believe that all of the net operating loss benefits generated during the year will be realized in the foreseeable future 
we recorded a minority interest in the net loss of flip chip technologies of million 
the minority interest reflects the portion of flip chip technologies that is owned by delco  our joint venture partner 
our net loss for fiscal was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded bookings totaling million compared to million during fiscal the million decrease in fiscal bookings primarily reflected an industry wide slowdown in orders for semiconductor assembly equipment 
at september   total backlog of customer orders approximated million compared to million at september  net sales for the fiscal year decreased by million to million from million in fiscal the lower sales volume generally reflected the slowdown in the semiconductor industry  resulting in reduced demand for semiconductor assembly equipment and to a lesser extent packaging materials 
the majority of the reduction in net sales was in our equipment segment where net sales decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fewer unit sales of ball bonders approximately  ball bonders were sold in fiscal compared to over  in fiscal were partially offset by higher unit sales of wedge bonders resulting in the lower equipment segment sales in fiscal packaging materials segment net sales decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the lower packaging material segment net sales was due primarily to lower average selling prices of bonding wire as the result of lower prevailing gold prices in fiscal compared to fiscal international sales shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of our total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  the philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong  accounted for approximately and of our total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  shipments to customers located in taiwan  the philippines  malaysia and korea accounted for approximately   and of net sales  compared to   and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
the most significant change in foreign destination sales occurred in korea  where korean based customers  which have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our sales  were adversely affected by the financial turmoil in that country and as a result  reduced their orders from us 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the lower unit volume of equipment segment sales in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  due to lower gross profit margin in the equipment segment partially offset by higher gross profit margin in the packaging materials segment 
the equipment segment gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to the lower unit volume  which resulted in the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs by fewer units 
our packaging materials segment gross profit margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due primarily to improved manufacturing efficiencies at our bonding wire and saw blade facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase of million consisted of approximately million related to the equipment segment  million related to the packaging materials segment and million of incremental corporate costs 
the increase in the equipment segment selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased selling  marketing and customer support costs associated with the launch of our new model and wire bonders and increased spending in connection with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system  which replaced the segment s business and accounting systems 
the slight increase in the package materials selling  general and administrative expenses costs in fiscal was due to higher sales and distribution infrastructure costs 
research and development costs increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the research and development costs incurred were in the equipment segment and were due to increased internal labor  higher outside contract development costs and increased expenditures for prototype materials as we continued development of additional products in the family of wire bonders 
we also continued to invest in new technologies  which may eventually lead to improved and alternative semiconductor assembly technologies 
gross research and development expenditures were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we recorded resizing costs of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal reflecting our efforts to reduce our workforce and discontinue products in response to the industry wide slowdown in orders for semiconductor assembly equipment and  to a lesser extent  semiconductor packaging materials 
the resizing costs consisted of million of severance  million of asset writeoffs associated with discontinued products and million of other liabilities associated with the resizing 
at september   we had accrued liabilities of million in connection with the resizing charges  the majority of which were paid in fiscal loss from operations in fiscal was million compared to operating income of million in fiscal the unfavorable variance to fiscal was due primarily to lower unit sales volume and gross profit in our equipment segment and to resizing charges  both resulting from the slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
partially off setting the lower operating income in the equipment segment was a million improvement in operating income in our packaging materials segment  excluding resizing charges 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the investment of net proceeds from our may public offering of common stock for a full year in fiscal  compared to a partial year in fiscal  and to the paydown of all outstanding bank debt with a portion of the proceeds of the public offering in may during fiscal  we recognized an million pre tax loss from our equity interest in flip chip technologies compared to a pre tax loss of million in fiscal the increase in the loss in fiscal resulted from delays in potential customers evaluations of flip chip technologies manufacturing process and the generally soft business environment in the semiconductor industry  along with a ramp up of flip chip technologies production facility 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate of this benefit was  resulting from us pre tax losses exceeding foreign pre tax income that was taxed at lower rates 
our net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
quarterly results of operations the table below shows our quarterly net sales  gross profit and operating income loss by quarter for fiscal and first second third fourth fiscal quarter quarter quarter quarter total net sales      gross profit      income loss from operations     first second third fourth fiscal quarter quarter quarter quarter total net sales      gross profit      income loss from operations      the effect of the semiconductor industry downturn on our operating results is reflected in the quarterly results throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal the turnaround in the industry cycle is reflected in the second half of fiscal effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas was issued 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters for financial statements for fiscal years commencing after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million compared to million at september  additionally  we have a million bank revolving credit facility  which expires in march borrowings are subject to our compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the revolving credit documents 
at september   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility and had no cash borrowings outstanding under that facility  but had utilized million of availability under the credit facility to support letters of credit issued as security deposits for our new manufacturing facility in singapore and our new x lam facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings denominated in either us dollars or foreign currencies 
borrowings in us dollars bear interest either at a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate minus or the federal funds rate plus or  at a libor rate defined as libor plus to  depending on our leverage ratio 
foreign currency borrowings bear interest at a libor rate  as defined above  applicable to the foreign currency 
on december   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes 
on december  we issued an additional million of convertible subordinated notes in connection with the exercise of the initial purchasers over allotment option 
the notes are general obligations of our company and subordinated to all senior debt 
the notes bear interest at  are convertible into our common stock at per share and mature on december  there are no financial covenants associated with the notes and there are no restrictions on paying dividends  incurring additional debt or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
interest on the notes will be paid on june and december of each year beginning june  we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time after december  at prices ranging from at december  to at december  cash used in operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to cash generated by operating activities of million during fiscal and million in fiscal the use of cash from operating activities was primarily the result of the net loss we recorded in fiscal and the increase in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by a significant increase in accounts payable  due to the ramp up in business in the fourth quarter 
at september   our working capital was million compared to million at september  our lower working capital was due primarily to a million reduction in cash and short term investments and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory 
the higher non cash working capital assets were the result of the ramp up in business in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we invested approximately million in property and equipment  primarily for leasehold improvements and tooling for our new singapore facility and our advanced packaging technology business  an increase in capacity for the packaging and materials business and an upgrade of our computer hardware and software systems in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system that became operational in fiscal we presently expect fiscal capital spending to more than double as we continue investing in the projects listed above 
during fiscal  we loaned million to flip chip technologies  then  as mentioned above  converted all outstanding loans and interest including the million invested in fiscal into equity units of flip chip technologies  thereby increasing our ownership interest in flip chip technologies to from 
in september  we entered into a joint venture agreement to develop  manufacture and market advanced polymer materials for semiconductor and microelectronic packaging end users 
through september   we have invested million in this joint venture and have committed to invest an additional million 
we purchased the x lam technology for million in the second quarter of fiscal through september   we have invested an additional million for operational and capital expenditures  and we expect additional funding requirements will be necessary in future years 
the israeli government has funded a portion of the research and development costs related to some of our products 
we are contingently liable to repay this funding through royalties to the israeli government 
royalty payments are due only after sale of the funded products  are computed at varying rates from to of the sales and are limited to the amounts received from the israeli government 
at september   we estimate that contingent liabilities for royalties related to potential future product sales are less than million 
we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  the proceeds from the sale of million of the convertible subordinated notes described above  our working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may seek  as required  equity or debt financing to provide capital for corporate purposes and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements that could require substantial capital outlays 
we cannot determine the timing and amount of these potential capital requirements at this time because they will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions and competitive factors and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities that we may elect to pursue 
risks related to our business our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future in the past  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
although these fluctuations are partly due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry  they also reflect the impact of other factors  some of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that could cause our revenues and or operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are o the mix of products that we sell because  for example packaging materials generally have lower margins than assembly equipment  some lines of equipment are more profitable than others  and some sales arrangements have higher margins than others  o the volume and timing of orders for our products and any order postponements and cancellations by our customers  o adverse changes in our pricing  or that of our competitors  o higher than anticipated costs of development or production of new equipment models  o the availability and cost of key components for our products  o market acceptance of our new products and upgraded versions of our products  o our announcement of  or perception by others that we will introduce  new or upgraded products  which could delay customers from purchasing our products  o the timing of acquisitions  and o our competitors introduction of new products 
many of our expenses  such as research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  do not vary directly with our net sales 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net sales  our operating results would decline 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include o the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  o severance and other costs of relocating facilities or resizings in market downturns  and o inventory writeoffs due to obsolesence 
because our revenues and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
the semiconductor industry as a whole is volatile  as are our financial results our operating results are significantly affected by the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers worldwide 
expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors  such as personal computers  telecommunications  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
any significant downturn in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions would likely reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
this has severely and negatively affected the industry s demand for capital equipment  including the assembly equipment that we manufacture and market and  to a lesser extent  the packaging materials that we sell 
these downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected our operating results 
in the downturn  for example  our net sales declined from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal and continued to decline in the first half of fiscal downturns in the future could similarly adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are in the process of transfering our automatic ball bonder manufacturing to singapore  which could disrupt our ability to supply our customers and may not result in the cost savings we anticipate the proposed move of our automatic ball bonder manufacturing to singapore will require us to relocate equipment  hire and train production  engineering and management personnel  qualify suppliers and develop a purchasing and delivery infrastructure 
in addition  we expect to experience increased selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal in connection with start up costs 
we plan to source a significantly higher percentage of materials from suppliers in singapore 
to the extent we experience availability  reliability or quality problems as a result of this shift in supply source  our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  we do not intend to move our research and development function from willow grove to the singapore facility 
if we are unable to accomplish the move efficiently and commence full production as scheduled  our ability to fill orders could be hurt  which could damage our relationships with customers 
in addition  our ability to meet production requirements may be adversely affected by any problems associated with the start up of this facility 
we also anticipate cost savings from the transfer of our automatic ball bonder manufacturing as a result of reduced costs of labor  shipping and materials 
however  we cannot assure you that we will realize these savings 
our business depends on attracting and retaining management  marketing and technical employees who are in great demand as is the case with all technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees 
competition is intense in personnel recruiting in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries  particularly with respect to some engineering disciplines 
in particular  we have experienced periodic shortages of software engineers 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel we require  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to rapidly develop and manufacture new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business we believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture or acquire new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we also must introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in response to customers demands for higher performance assembly equipment 
our competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior performance  features and lower prices that may render our products noncompetitive 
we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner or at a price that will satisfy future customers needs or achieve market acceptance 
for example  the introduction of the model wire bonder in was less successful than we had hoped because of higher than anticipated design and production costs and lower than anticipated sales prices 
we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our product lines we typically operate our business with a relatively short backlog and order supplies and otherwise plan production based on internal forecasts of demand 
due to these factors  we have in the past  and may again in the future  fail to accurately forecast demand  in terms of both volume and configuration for either our current or next generation wire bonders 
this has led to and may in the future lead to delays in product shipments or  alternatively  an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
for example  we inaccurately forecasted demand for the model wire bonder in and consequently recorded writeoffs for excess inventory 
also  we underestimated the magnitude of the improvement in the semiconductor industry at the end of fiscal and the demand for the new model ball bonder  as a result some customer shipments may be delayed in fiscal if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
advanced packaging technologies other than wire bonding may render some of our products obsolete and our strategy for pursuing these other technologies may be costly and ineffective advanced packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit or ic package  as compared to traditional die and wire bonding 
these technologies include flip chip  chip scale packaging and tape automated bonding 
in general  these advanced technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package 
for some assemblies  these advanced technologies have largely replaced wire bonding 
however  today most ics still employ die and wire bonding technology  and the possible extent  rate and timing of change is difficult  if not impossible  to predict 
in fact  wire bonding has proved more durable than we originally anticipated  largely because of its reliability and cost 
however  we cannot assure you that the semiconductor industry will not  in the future  shift a significant part of its volume into advanced packaging technologies  such as those discussed above 
presently  intel  motorola  ibm and advanced micro devices  for example  have developed flip chip technologies for internal use  and a number of other companies are also increasing their investments in advanced packaging technologies 
if a significant shift to advanced technologies were to occur  demand for our wire bonders and related packaging materials would diminish 
one component of our strategy is to develop the capacity to use advanced technologies to allow us to compete in those portions of the market that currently use these advanced technologies and to prepare for any eventual decline in the use of wire bonding technology 
there are a number of risks associated with our strategy to diversify into new technologies o the technologies that we have invested in represent only some of the advanced technologies that may one day supercede wire bonding  o other companies are developing similar or alternative advanced technologies  o wire bonding may continue as the dominant technology for longer than we anticipate  o the cost of developing advanced technologies may be significantly greater than we expect  and o we may not be able to develop the necessary technical  research  managerial and other related skills to develop  produce  market and support these advanced technologies 
as a result of these risks  we cannot assure you that any of our attempts to develop alternative technologies will be profitable or that we will be able to realize the benefits that we anticipate from them 
because we have a small number of products  a decline in demand for  or the price of  any of our products could cause our revenues to decline significantly historically  our wire bonders have comprised at least of our net sales 
if demand for  or pricing of  our wire bonders declines because our competitors introduce superior or lower cost systems  the semiconductor industry changes or because of other occurrences beyond our control  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
because a small number of customers account for nearly all our sales  our revenues could decline if we lose any significant customer the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers purchasing a substantial portion of semiconductor assembly equipment and packaging materials 
sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales  of our fiscal net sales and of our fiscal net sales 
in fiscal  our sales to anam accounted for of our net sales  and sales to intel accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  sales to intel accounted for of our net sales 
during fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of our net sales 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
if we lose orders from a significant customer  or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially  these losses or reductions will adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for materials and  if our suppliers do not deliver their products to us  we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers our products are complex and require materials  components and subassemblies of an exceptionally high degree of reliability  accuracy and performance 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some material components 
our reliance involves a number of significant risks  including o loss of control over the manufacturing process  o changes in our manufacturing processes  dictated by changes in the market  that have delayed our shipments  o our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials  o the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our contractors and suppliers  which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies  components or parts in the volumes we require and at quality levels and prices we can accept  o reliability and quality problems we experience with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers  and o delays in the delivery of subassemblies  which  in turn  have caused delays in some of our shipments 
if we are unable to deliver products to our customers on time for these or any other reasons  or if we do not maintain acceptable product quality or reliability in the future  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we are expanding and diversifying our operations  and if we fail to manage our expanding and more diverse operations successfully  our business and financial results may be materially and adversely affected in recent years  we have broadened our product offerings to include significantly more packaging materials 
although our strategy is to diversify our products and services  we may not be able to develop  acquire  introduce or market new products in a timely or cost effective manner and the market may not accept any new or improved products we develop  acquire  introduce or market 
our diversification into new lines of business and our expansion through acquisitions and alliances has increased  and is expected to continue to increase  demand on our management  financial resources and information and internal control systems 
our success depends in significant part on our ability to manage and integrate acquisitions  joint ventures and other alliances and to continue to implement  improve and expand our systems  procedures and controls 
if we fail to do this at a pace consistent with the development of our business  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
as we seek to expand our operations  we expect to encounter a number of risks  which will include o risks associated with hiring additional management and other critical personnel  o risks associated with adding equipment and capacity  and o risks associated with increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
in addition  sales and servicing of packaging materials and advanced technologies require different organizational and managerial skills than sales of traditional wire bonding technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary skills to successfully produce and market these different products 
we sell most of our products to customers located outside of the us and we have substantial manufacturing operations located outside of the us  both of which subject us to risks from changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  political instability and war approximately of our net sales for fiscal  of our net sales for fiscal and of our net sales for fiscal were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the united states 
we expect our sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
our future performance will depend  in significant part  on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets  particularly in asia 
asian economies have been highly volatile  resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies  and political and economic instability 
these conditions may continue or worsen  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we rely on non us suppliers for materials and components used in the equipment that we sell 
we also maintain substantial manufacturing operations in countries other than the united states  including operations in israel and singapore 
as a result  a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international commerce such as  risks of war and civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation of our foreign assets  longer payment cycles in foreign markets  international exchange restrictions  the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations  tariff and currency fluctuations  changing political conditions  foreign governments monetary policies  and less protective foreign intellectual property laws 
because most of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  an increase in value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors 
our ability to compete overseas in the future could be materially and adversely affected by a strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
the ability of our international operations to prosper also will depend  in part  on a continuation of current trade relations between the united states and foreign countries in which our customers operate and in which our subcontractors have assembly operations 
a change toward more protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries in which we do business  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
our success depends in part on our intellectual property  which we may be unable to protect our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
to protect this technology  we rely principally on contractual restrictions such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements in our agreements with employees  vendors  consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we secondarily rely  in some cases  on patent and copyright protection  which may become more important to us as we expand our investment in advanced packaging technologies 
we may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons  including o our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to or better than ours  o employees  vendors  consultants and customers may not abide by their contractual agreements  and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may prove to be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate  o foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and o our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology  patents or copyrights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology 
in addition  our partners in joint ventures and alliances may also have rights to technology we develop through those joint ventures and alliances 
if we are unable to protect our technology  we could weaken our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
third parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property  which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses  or prevent us from selling some of our products the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new products and technologies 
as a result  industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others  increasing the risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims that they infringe on the intellectual property of others 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement 
if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture  market or use the affected product  or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
occasionally  third parties assert that we are  or may be  infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights 
in these cases  we will defend against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate 
intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if we become involved in this type of litigation  it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business 
some of our customers have received notices of infringement from the lemelson medical  education and research foundation limited partnership the lemelson foundation  alleging that equipment we have supplied to our customers  and processes this equipment performs  infringes on patents held by the lemelson foundation 
these notices increased substantially in  the year in which the lemelson foundation settled its suit against the ford motor company  and entered into license agreements with ford  gm and chrysler 
since the settlement  a number of our customers  including intel  have been sued by the lemelson foundation 
some of our customers have requested that we defend and indemnify them against the lemelson foundation s claims or contribute to any settlement the customer reaches with the lemelson foundation 
we have received opinions from our outside patent counsel with respect to various lemelson foundation patents 
we are not aware that any equipment we market or that any process performed by our equipment infringes on the lemelson foundation patents and we do not believe that the lemelson foundation matter or any other pending intellectual property claim against us will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the ultimate outcome of any infringement or misappropriation claim affecting us is uncertain  however  and we cannot assure you that our resolution of this litigation will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
other risks year if our products or our internal data management  accounting  manufacturing or operating software and systems do not adequately or accurately process or manage day or date information beyond the year  our operations could be affected adversely 
to address the issue  we created an internal task force to assess our state of readiness for possible year issues and to take the necessary actions to ensure our year compliance 
the taskforce has evaluated and continues to evaluate o our products and our internal business systems and software  and o our vulnerability to possible year exposure due to suppliers and other third parties lack of preparedness for the year to evaluate equipment that we sell and equipment  tools or software that we use  we employed year readiness test scenarios established by sematech  an industry group comprised of us semiconductor manufacturers 
based on this assessment  we do not believe the operation of the equipment that we sell or the equipment  tools and software that we use will be affected by the transition to the year we completed our review  material corrective measures and contingency planning in september in connection with our review and corrective measures  we replaced the business and accounting systems of our us and israeli equipment manufacturing sites with a new enterprise resource planning system that was represented to us to be year compliant 
we spent approximately million in hardware  software  consulting costs and internal expenses to implement this new system 
in addition  we have been in contact with our suppliers and other third parties to determine the extent to which they may be vulnerable to year issues 
we have received representations as to the year compliance of our major suppliers 
we believe that the reasonably anticipated worst case scenario for our business resulting from year problems would be unexpected delays of supplier deliveries and customer shipments 
if these delays are significant  customers may cancel orders and long term customer relationships could be damaged 
we believe that we have developed appropriate contingency plans for any year delays  including carrying larger inventory of products from a small number of suppliers that we believe may be vulnerable to year disruptions 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a change in control 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that o classify our board of directors into four classes  with one class being elected each year  o permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval  and o prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of or more of our voting securities without super majority board or shareholder approval 
further  under the pennsylvania business corporation law  because our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  shareholders may only remove directors for cause 
these provisions and some provisions of the pennsylvania business corporation law could delay  defer or prevent us from experiencing a change in control and may adversely affect our common stockholders voting and other rights 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   we had a non trading investment portfolio of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of million see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
at september   we also were obligated  under a foreign exchange contract  to purchase million swiss francs in march for million 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate and exchange rate risk and may fall in value if market rates change 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points and we experienced an adverse move in the swiss currency rate of there would be no material or adverse affect on our business  financial condition or operating results
