operating expenses for fiscal were  or of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses for fiscal amounted to of net sales  compared to in the prior year

accounting for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate and provision benefit from income taxes in fiscal differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to interest income  some of which is exempt from federal income taxes due to the nature of the investments from which it is derived 
liquidity and capital resources since its initial public offering  the company has funded its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations and credit facilities with institutional lenders 
in june  the company completed an initial public stock offering  issuing a total of  new common shares which raised approximately  in proceeds to the company  net of fees and expenses 
a portion of these proceeds was used by the company to pay off borrowings on its line of credit and for other working capital purposes 
the remainder was invested in marketable securities 
the company has a credit agreement with a major bank providing a million revolving line of credit  for the issuance of commercial letters of credit 
the agreement  which expires december   is unsecured 
the agreement requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants 
over the past several years  borrowings have varied  typically reaching highest levels in the pre christmas periods 
however  more recently the company has borrowed against its line of credit less frequently due to the ability to finance operations internally from cash and marketable securities available for sale 
balances on the line of credit are classified as current liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
cash and marketable securities available for sale totaled  as of july   compared to  as of july  net working capital as of july  was  compared to  as of july   and the company s current ratio was as of july   compared to as of july  the decreases in working capital and current ratio are primarily due to decreases in cash of approximately  used for the purchase of treasury stock during fiscal and  used as payment pursuant to entering into a trampoline license agreement in december   as well as due to cash used in and generated from operations  particularly via increases and decreases in inventory and increases in and collections of accounts receivable  that result in daily fluctuations in short term investments 
the company had no long term debt as of july  and the company had net stockholders equity of  as of july   compared to  as of july   with such decrease due primarily to the purchase of treasury stock and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to unrealized losses on investments in marketable securities  offset by the operating results for the fiscal year ended july  management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact upon the company s costs and prices during the past three fiscal years 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled  compared to  during fiscal the decrease is primarily due to  of machinery and equipment expenditures for the snowboard plant closed during fiscal of the fiscal total  approximately  represented machinery and equipment expenditures for computer equipment and  represented production molds compared to  and  respectively  for such expenditures during the prior year 
future liquidity and financial position the company intends to continue to focus upon building and maintaining its existing product lines  including its new line of quik shade r instant canopies and its new introduction of airzone tm  a springless trampoline 
the company also plans to continue to devote resources toward the pursuit and development of new products 
in addition  management continues to explore the possibility of making selected acquisitions of other companies or products which would offer a strategic fit with the company s existing products and its sourcing and distribution channels in the mass market 
the company also is considering expanding international distribution and developing additional distribution arrangements in order to take further advantage of growth opportunities which management believes exist for its products outside the united states 
the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock commencing in october for an aggregate purchase price of up to  the company currently anticipates repurchasing all properly tendered shares of common stock by the end of december the company believes that all funds required for the repurchase of common stock will be obtained from the company s available cash and marketable securities 
management believes that its current cash position  funds available under existing banking arrangements  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s presently projected cash and working capital requirements for the next fiscal year assuming continued financial performance at present levels 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currency of its suppliers has in the last three fiscal years had any significant material and adverse impact on the company s ability to purchase products at agreed upon prices 
typically  the company and its suppliers negotiate prices in us dollars and payments to suppliers are also made in us dollars 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the value of the dollar will not have an impact upon the company in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its investments in short term instruments and money market funds and in available for sale securities  which consist of bond mutual funds 
these investments are subject to risks associated with the level of volatility within the various financial markets  changes in interest rates  the condition of the united states and world economies and many other factors 
available for sale securities are reported by the company at fair value 
additional factors that could affect operating results the following factors  together with other risk factors discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information contained elsewhere herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
reliance on major customers 
in the past three fiscal years  the company has had several customers which accounted for a majority of the company s sales 
as is customary in the industry  the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers 
the loss of  or a reduction in business from  any of its major customers could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because a large percentage of the company s accounts receivables are due from the major customers  the failure of any of them to make timely payments with respect to its account could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
competition from other manufacturers developers of products  price sensitivity of customers 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and there are no significant technological or manufacturing barriers to entry for most product categories other than the quik shade r instant canopy and the airzone tm trampoline 
while the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are price  quality of product  brand recognition  accessibility and customer service  the company s primary customers  mass merchandisers  are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  the company must continually monitor and control its costs while refining its products to maintain its market position 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to provide its products at prices which are competitive or that it can continue to design and market products that appeal to consumers even if price competitive 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  smaller retailers may be acquired by  receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
the company also competes to a lesser degree with manufacturers of specialty or premium priced products 
the company s primary competitors in the mass market include first team sports  inc skate attack  roller derby cas  seneca and certain models from rollerblade  inc blade runner 
in the case of athletic protective equipment  franklin sports is the company s primary competitor in the mass market 
bell sports corp 
bell and bsi and protective technologies  inc pti are the primary competitors in the recreational safety helmet mass market 
for instant canopies  the company s primary competitors are international e z up  inc and enviroworks  inc 
for trampolines  a new category introduced in  the company s primary competitors are jumpking  inc and hedstrom 
in addition  the company may compete with its primary customers when such customers directly source products that the company sells 
at present  the company believes that its products in each category  when compared to competitors products of comparable quality  are currently offered at comparable or lower prices than most or all of its competitors 
however there can be no assurance that other companies  whether new enterprises or established members of the retail or sporting goods industries  will not be able to develop products of comparable or higher quality at lower prices  or that the company s price structure will not be affected by future circumstances 
shifting and uncertain consumer demand 
the company must continually anticipate the emergence of  and adapt its products to  the popular demands of consumers 
in the past  a substantial amount of the company s net sales have been generated by sales of in line skates  skateboards and athletic protective equipment 
since then the company has developed other product lines  including safety helmets  snowboards  yo yo s  trampolines and portable canopies 
no assurance can be given  however  that consumer demand for these products in general or the company s products in particular will continue into the future 
a reduction in the demand for these products could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
quik shade r is a line of instant portable canopies recently introduced by the company 
no assurance can be given that the market for these instant canopies will continue or that the company s product offerings in this market will become or remain competitive 
also in fiscal  static snowboards  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  experienced operating losses  primarily due to the continuing challenges facing the snowboard industry in general 
accordingly  an impairment loss totaling  representing the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value of assets  was recognized during the second quarter for write downs of fixed assets and write off of the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill relating to such subsidiary 
during the assets of the static manufacturing operation were sold and the manufacturing plant was closed  with the intention of sourcing snowboards from independent contractors 
government regulations could hurt the company s business 
the consumer retail industry is regulated by many agencies including but not limited to  the consumer product safety commission and the california department of food and agriculture division of measurement standards 
existing legislation or regulation and any new laws or regulations could hurt the company s business 
the nature of any new laws and regulations and the manner in which existing and new laws and regulations may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined 
the enforcement of existing laws and regulations and the adoption of any future laws or regulations might decrease the demand for the company s products  impose taxes or other costly technical requirements or otherwise increase the cost of doing business which could hurt the company s business 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on the company s business 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may negatively affect the company s stock price 
the company s quarterly results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors  not all of which are under the company s control 
some of the factors that could cause the company s revenues and operating results to fluctuate include the following 
inventory returns  
the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  
increasing operating expenses  
changes in the prices for the company s products  
the compensation of the company s sales personnel based on achievement of periodic sales quotas  
fluctuations in the duration of the sales cycle for the company s products  
the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products by the company s competitors or by the company  and 
conditions specific to the consumer retail industries and general economic factors 
it is possible that in some future periods the company s results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could result in a decline in the value of the company s common stock 
reliance on foreign suppliers to source the company s products 
the company s products are primarily sourced from suppliers located in asia with whom the company does not have long term contractual agreements 
if the company were unable to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers that would allow it to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on acceptable commercial terms  its business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  the company may not be able to obtain its products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in order to sustain its operating margins 
although management presently believes that other suppliers could be obtained in such instances  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in the future 
in addition  purchasing products from foreign suppliers subjects the company to the general risks of doing business abroad 
these risks include potential delays in shipment  work stoppages  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import duties and tariffs  changes in foreign regulations and political instability 
a significant portion of the company s products  including various models of its in line skates  are manufactured in mainland china  which trades with the united states under a normal trade relations ntr trade status 
while the company believes that alternative manufacturing sources could be found  maintaining existing costs will depend upon these products continuing to be treated under ntr tariff rates 
from time to time  the us has threatened to rescind ntr tariff rates and impose trade sanctions on certain goods manufactured in china 
to date  no such sanctions have been imposed that have affected the company or its products  however there can be no assurance with regard to the possible imposition of sanctions in the future 
in addition  the current market crisis in asia may have a material and adverse impact upon the company s ability to procure products from suppliers 
however  the company may be able to move production quickly to alternate sources in response to economic or political circumstances that might arise in any particular country 
product liability claims  insurance 
due to the nature of its products  the company is subject to product liability claims  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
coverage is on a claims made basis  and is subject to certain deductibles 
although the company believes that it has adequate liability insurance for risks arising in the normal course of business  including product liability insurance with respect to all of its products  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future 
successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
trademarks and proprietary rights 
there are risks inherent in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  including those associated with patent issues and marketability 
potential liability from patent and other intellectual property infringements can have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
more specifically  in march  the company was served with two lawsuits entitled i mark c 
carter and international e z up  inc v 
variflex  inc and service merchandise co  inc 
case no 
wjr rnbx in the united states district court for the central district of california in los angeles and ii james p 
lynch and kd kanopy  inc v 
variflex  inc 
civil action no 
d in the united states district court of colorado 
the first complaint a alleges  among other things  that the company s quik shade r product infringes a patent owned by the plaintiff and used in a competing instant set up  collapsible canopy product  and infringes plaintiff s trade dress  and b prays for unspecified monetary damages  treble damages  punitive damages  costs and attorney s fees  an injunction and the destruction of all allegedly infringing products 
the second complaint a alleges that the company s quik shade r product infringes two patents owned by the plaintiff and b prays for an accounting  general damages  treble damages  an injunction and costs and attorney s fees 
the company has filed an answer in both lawsuits denying the allegations of the complaints and has filed counterclaims in both lawsuits seeking declarations of patent invalidity and non infringement as to the plaintiffs patents  as well as damages against the plaintiffs for alleged antitrust violations and restitution for unfair competition violations 
on september  the court allowed plaintiffs carter and e z up to amend their complaint to state an additional claim against the company for alleged infringement of an additional patent 
the company has answered this amended complaint  denying its material allegations  and pleading an amended counterclaim for similar alleged wrongs as previously pleaded in its counterclaim 
in september  the company received a demand for defense and indemnification of service merchandise company  inc in that action entitled mark c 
carter  et 
al 
v 
service merchandise company  inc  case no 
c dlj enb in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the complaint in this action is virtually identical to the complaint on behalf of service merchandise in the above referenced action by carter in the central district of california in los angeles 
the company has agreed to indemnify and defend service merchandise which is a retailer of the company s product in this action 
service merchandise filed an answer to the complaint in the central district of california los angeles action 
thereafter  the plaintiff dismissed without prejudice the northern district of california action  and the claim proceeded in the los angeles action 
thereafter  service merchandise filed a chapter bankruptcy petition  so the case is now stayed as to that defendant only 
no party has taken any action to obtain an order for relief from the automatic stay as to defendant service merchandise 
the los angeles action has had extensive discovery taken  with a trial date set for february  recently the denver action was ordered transferred to the federal court in los angeles  with a recommendation for consolidation with the previously pending los angeles action 
the los angeles court has not yet acted to consolidate the two actions 
the transfer of the denver action to los angeles and the addition of the new patent in suit probably will result in a to day continuance of the existing trial date by agreement of the parties  subject to the approval of the court 
in the carter action  safeco insurance company of america has agreed to provide a defense with a reservation of rights 
safeco denies coverage for the patent claims and reserves rights as to trade dress and advertising injury claims  asserting numerous defenses to coverage 
on september  safeco filed  and on october  caused to be served on the company  a complaint for declaratory relief entitled safeco insurance company of america vs 
variflex  inc  et al  case no 
bc in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles the coverage action 
the coverage action asserts a single cause of action for declaratory relief by which safeco seeks a declaration concerning seven different theories of defense to coverage liability in the underlying carter action 
the company has not yet answered the coverage action  but it will do so on or before november  the company intends vigorously to defend the coverage action 
further  based on a recent judicial decision  the company also will tender to safeco the defense of the lynch action referenced above 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims alleged in the carter and lynch complaints and intends to conduct a vigorous defense 
the company also intends to vigorously pursue its counterclaims 
an unfavorable outcome in the above matters could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business prospects and financial condition 
in addition  even if the ultimate outcome in both cases is resolved in favor of the company  the defense of such litigation may involve considerable costs  which could be material  and could divert the efforts of management  which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
with respect to the company s own patents  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  the company considers such proprietary rights as critical to its success  and relies on patent and trademark law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  customers  partners and others to protect its proprietary rights 
the company holds or has pending certain design patents and utility patents and employs various trademarks  trade names  including its own logos  in the packaging and advertising of its products
