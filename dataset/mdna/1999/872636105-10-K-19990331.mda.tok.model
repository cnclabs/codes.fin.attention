the increase in net sales per unit was the result of the higher production achieved through the installation of thousands of new nextgen tm photocopiers in existing sites and new multi site retail locations 
at the same time  many low volume producing sites were eliminated  thus decreasing the total billed units in the field see the discussion of nextgen tm under new products and services under development and multi site retailers under locations

sales in north america have declined percent over the last fiscal year  while sales in europe have increased percent during the same period 
the decline in north america represents a maturing market in the small  independent retail customer base and increasing market demand for new black and white technology photocopiers

impact of year the year yk issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any such software programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company relies on computer systems and software to operate its business  including applications used in account maintenance  purchasing  inventory management  finance and various administrative functions 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has formed a cross functional yk business improvement team that reports to the company s chief information officer cio 
the cio has full authority to establish methodologies  approve expenditures  and marshal additional resources as necessary 
two full time project managers who answer directly to the cio manage the initiative and oversee the project team 
the cio is responsible for researching  planning  executing  implementing and completing the initiative for the company 
the three primary functional categories evaluated in the initiative include information technology it which consists of all internal hardware and software used to support the company s financial and administrative operations 
communications network  which processes voice and data information relating to the company s global communications systems  including voice and data equipment and related software 
facilities consisting of all systems necessary to run an office including security system  fire suppression  generators  hvac  and associated systems 
for each of the three functional categories the company is in the process of or has completed the following three phase approach to identify and address the potential impact of yk compliance issues 
phase i inventory and assessment inventory and assessment involves each yk team member identifying all relevant systems  providers and information sources within their functional areas 
an assessment is then made on each discovery to determine which items are mission critical 
phase i was completed on february  for all primary functional categories 
phase ii remediation remediation is the process of making changes to hardware  software or services in order to become yk compliant 
during the inventory and assessment phase each system is evaluated for remediation 
each system requiring remediation under the company s direct control will be replace or upgraded as needed 
phase ii is underway and should be completed during the third quarter of for all categories except voice communication systems which were completed on february  phase iii testing  and contingency planning all mission critical systems  including both internal and external  identified during the inventory stage will be tested by the company sufficient to confirm whether the system will continue to operate properly in yk and beyond 
proper contingency planning for all mission critical items will allow the company to mitigate the risk associated with potential yk failures 
the company will consider itself yk compliant when all phases of the project have been successfully completed and approved by the cio 
phase iii is underway and should be completed by the end of the third quarter of for all categories 
in addition to the replacement of mission critical accounting and operations systems with erp enterprise resource planning systems to accommodate for yk readiness and overall business improvement  the company has also engaged in a converging contingency method for its existing accounting and operations legacy systems to assure yk compliance in the event any part of the new systems implementation falls behind 
the costs to address the company s yk issues independent of the yk project  the company has initiated significant systems upgrades to enhance performance and reliability of many of its computer based information systems 
these upgrades will  as an additional benefit  rectify certain identified yk issues 
the total it and communications network budget for all systems activities is million for calendar expenditures directly related to yk issues are estimated to be approximately  these costs are related to a new enterprise wide software system that will enhance the company s current information system and will be capitalized 
expenditures for other planned systems upgrades  totaling million  will address certain yk issues as a corollary benefit to the company  but have been initiated primarily to enhance system reliability 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for the yk modifications 
the company continues to manage total it expenses by re prioritizing or curtailing less critical investments  incorporating yk readiness into previously planned system enhancements and using existing staff to implement its yk modifications 
the cost of facilities non it related yk compliance issues is not expected to be material 
the risks of the company s issues the company has initiated communications with all of its significant service providers  lenders  and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable in the event any of those third parties fail to remedy their own yk issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
contingencies for systems scheduled for replacement include upgrades and service packs from manufacturers of third party software as well as dedicated programming time from internal information systems staff to produce hot fix repairs to modify date integer fields and input masks to reflect long integer format 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the yk issue will not pose significant operations problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the yk issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send customer invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities

france will be subject to the euro conversion  and the united kingdom may become subject to the conversion 
the company believes that it will be able to accommodate the conversion to the euro without a material impact on its financial statements
