ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
see selected financial data 
in march  nareit issued a white paper analysis to address certain interpretive issues under its definition of ffo 
the white paper provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
since all companies and analysis do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 
the following table presents the company s ffo calculation for the years ended december  net earnings before limited partner s interest in operating partnership    less limited partner s interest in the operating partnership  net income available to common shareholders    adjustment for funds from operations add limited partner s interest in the operating partnership  depreciation    basic and diluted funds from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    assumes conversion of limited partnership units of the operating partnership 
ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the company s capital resources consist of its current equity in real estate investments carrying value less mortgage indebtedness 
the company maintains the real estate in good condition and provides adequate insurance coverage 
the company s rental revenues for were  the rental revenues for are expected to decrease by approximately  to  due mainly to expected vacancies absent any reletting in as a result  the vacant square footage is expected to increase from approximately  to  the leasing time table between getting a lease signed  building out the space and the tenant taking possession varies from months to months depending on the market in the geographical location of the property 
management estimates they will incur approximately  in tenant improvement costs to lease up these vacancies during despite the expected decrease in rental revenues and increase in tenant improvement costs  liquidity is considered sufficient to meet current obligations  which include capital expenditures  and is represented by cash and cash equivalents of  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities  as shown in the statements of cash flows  was  for the year ended december  the major uses of cash in were dividends to shareholders and distributions to the limited partner of the operating partnership totaling  and capital expenditures of   at broadbent   at southpoint and  in capitalized transfer tax for the transfer of company assets to the operating partnership in june 
a fourth quarter dividend was declared on january  to shareholders of record on march   payable march  the board of directors continues to closely monitor occupancies  leasing activity  overall company operations  and liquidity in determining quarterly dividends 
the company s debt service commitments for the mortgage loan payable are described in note to the financial statements 
there are no other material commitments at december  inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past few years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation has the indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
these factors  in the long run  are expected to result in more attractive returns from the company s real estate portfolio as compared to short term investment vehicles 
ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year issue although the company does not employ any computer systems in its business  the company could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the advisor cedar bay realty advisors  inc  property manager brentway management llc  and other service providers do not properly process and calculate the date related information from and after january  the advisor and property manager have taken steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address this issue 
these steps include an upgrade of their computer software to a version that will properly process and calculate the date related information from and after january  the upgrade was completed on january  the advisor and property manager are satisfied that the properties have no year issues since there are no elevators or other date sensitive equipment that would have an adverse effect on the operation of the buildings 
in addition  the advisor and property manager will endeavor to obtain reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the company s other major service providers 
while the advisor and property manager believe their efforts are adequate to address the company s year concerns  there can be no assurances that the systems of the other companies on which the company s operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the company
