we added service to manchester  new hampshire  in june and have been very pleased with the results 
we have plans to add new service to islip  new york  on long island in march and will begin serving at least one other new city in with the net addition of at least aircraft in new boeing s  two used s  and the retirement of six older s  we will also continue to add additional flights to cities we already serve 
we are actively pursuing the acquisition of additional used s that would add to our expansion efforts 
during  boeing experienced production delays related to the production line 
these production delays  for the most part  have been remedied by boeing and we currently do not anticipate any significant delays in also during  the company s customer service and reservations sales agents  represented by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  afl cio  and flight dispatchers  represented by the southwest airlines employees association  ratified collective bargaining agreements which will run through the years and  respectively

the prior years earnings per share amounts have been restated for the three for two stock split see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased by percent in to  million  compared to  million for this increase in operating revenues was derived primarily from an percent increase in passenger revenues as a result of a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms offset by a percent decrease in passenger revenue yield per rpm 
while southwest s passenger revenues increased percent in  the rpm yield decline resulted from the higher load factors  a percent increase in passenger trip lengths  and higher federal excise taxes on domestic tickets 
assuming load factors and passenger trip lengths continue to be above year ago levels  rpm yields will continue this trend 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  competitive responses from other air carriers and general economic conditions 
the percent increase in rpms in exceeded the percent increase in available seat miles asms  resulting in an increase in load factor from percent in to percent in the asm growth resulted from the net addition of aircraft during the year 
the load factor was percent in january  up points from january freight revenues in were million  compared to million in the percent increase in freight revenues fell short of the percent increase in asms for the same period 
united states mail revenue declined percent in and percent for fourth quarter as the postal service continues to shift away from commercial carriers 
this trend is expected to continue in other air freight revenues increased percent in due to increased capacity 
other revenues increased by percent in to million  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increased revenues from the sale of frequent flyer segment credits to participating partners in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for were  million  compared to  million in  an increase of percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to a percent decrease in average jet fuel price 
the decrease in average jet fuel prices was offset by a million increase in profitsharing and employee savings plan contributions and an increase in maintenance costs primarily due to unusually low aircraft engine overhaul costs in the first half of unit costs are expected to continue to benefit in first quarter  versus first quarter  from lower jet fuel prices 
excluding jet fuel costs  operating expenses per asm are expected to increase in first quarter compared to first quarter primarily due to higher profitsharing and employee savings plan contributions and increased advertising primarily related to the opening of islip  new york  on long island on march  the immediately preceding two sentences are forward looking statements which involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results

year over year decreases in jet fuel prices are expected to continue in first quarter due to the continued oversupply of crude oil and related products  along with the effects of the company s current fuel hedging positions 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent in  compared to  primarily as a result of an unusually low number of aircraft engine overhauls in the first six months of fourth quarter maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent over fourth quarter we expect modest year over year unit cost growth for maintenance materials and repairs in the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results

operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased by percent in to  million  compared to  million for this increase in operating revenues was derived primarily from an percent increase in passenger revenues as a result of a percent increase in rpms and a percent increase in passenger revenue yield per rpm 
southwest s passenger revenues benefited from a strong us economy  strong demand for air travel  increased fares  and a favorable mix of higher yielding fares 
the percent increase in rpms in  coupled with a percent increase in asms  resulted in a decrease in load factor from percent in to percent in the decrease in load factor was primarily the result of less promotional fare activity in the asm growth resulted from the addition of aircraft during the year 
freight revenues in were million  compared to million in the percent increase in freight revenues exceeded the percent increase in asms for the same period primarily due to an increase in united states mail services and increased air freight volumes resulting  in part  from the united parcel service labor strike during third quarter other revenues increased by percent in to million  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the sale of frequent flyer segment credits to participating partners in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for were  million  compared to  million in  an increase of percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity

under the terms of the contract  southwest will pay general electric a rate per flight hour in exchange for general electric performing substantially all engine maintenance for the cfm engines on the and aircraft 
the company has a similar agreement with general electric with respect to the engines on the aircraft 
maintenance on the pratt whitney jt d engines on the aircraft will continue to be performed by general electric on a time and materials basis 
by consolidating its engine repair work and committing to ten years  southwest believes it will spend substantially less over the course of the contract versus what it would have spent absent this new agreement 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results  such uncertainties include the number of unscheduled engine removals  labor rates  and competition in the engine overhaul market 
agency commissions per asm remained unchanged in  when compared to  as the mix of commissionable sales was relatively unchanged 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased

interest income for increased million primarily due to higher invested cash balances 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased in to percent from percent in the decrease resulted from lower effective state tax rates  including a reduced california income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operations was million in  compared to million in during  capital expenditures of million primarily were for the purchase of new aircraft and four used aircraft along with progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
in february  the company redeemed million of senior unsecured notes originally issued in february at december   capital commitments of the company primarily consisted of scheduled aircraft acquisitions and related flight equipment 
as of july   the board of directors increased the company s authorization to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock to million 
the company completed this repurchase program during third quarter  resulting in the repurchase of approximately million post split shares 
as of december   southwest had new s on firm order  including to be delivered in  with options to purchase another aggregate funding required for firm commitments approximated  million through the year  of which million related to see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments  including cash on hand at december   of million  internally generated funds  and a revolving credit line with a group of banks of up to million none of which had been drawn at december  
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
the company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of million of public debt securities  which it currently intends to utilize for aircraft financings in and market risk in  the securities and exchange commission issued new rules item of regulation s k which require disclosure of material risks  as defined in item  related to market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as defined  southwest currently has market risk sensitive instruments related to jet fuel prices and interest rates 
airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and  therefore  are impacted by changes in jet fuel prices 
jet fuel consumed in and represented approximately and percent of southwest s operating expenses  respectively 
southwest endeavors to acquire jet fuel at the lowest prevailing prices possible 
the company has historically hedged its exposure to jet fuel price market risk only on a conservative  limited basis 
in december  in order to take advantage of historically low jet fuel prices  southwest increased its fuel hedging activity by entering into fixed price swap agreements hedging approximately percent and percent of its jet fuel needs in first and second quarter  respectively 
in january  the company increased its hedging position for second quarter to percent 
during  the company may continue its fuel hedging activities at these higher levels to take advantage of the historically low jet fuel prices 
the fair values of outstanding fixed price swap agreements and purchased crude oil call options related to the company s jet fuel price market risk at december  and  and during the years then ended  were not material 
a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in the underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of these derivative commodity instruments and their related cash flows by approximately million 
airline operators are also inherently capital intensive  as the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize itself conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while southwest does use financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and a or equivalent credit ratings on its senior unsecured debt with three rating agencies standard poor s  moody s  and duff phelps 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had outstanding unsecured debt of million and million at december  and  respectively  of which only million was long term at december  this long term debt represents only percent and percent of total noncurrent assets at december  and  respectively 
the company currently has an average maturity of ten years for the long term debt at fixed rates averaging percent  which is comparable to average rates prevailing over the last ten years 
at december   the company operated aircraft under operating and capital leases at rates that are substantially fixed 
as defined in item  leases are not market risk sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its long term debt because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that have maturities of three months or less 
as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low  as the investments mature within three months 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow as the interest rates on the company s long term debt are fixed and its cash investments are short term 
a ten percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s publicly traded long term debt or its short term cash investments 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
impact of the year the company is in the process of converting its computer systems to be year ready 
this project encompasses information technology systems as well as embedded technology assets 
the project also includes an assessment of material third party relationships and associated risks 
the project as it relates to internal systems and equipment consists of four phases identification  assessment  remediation  and testing 
this project is expected to be substantially completed by june  flight safety systems the company has completed all phases of its year project as it relates to its aircraft fleet and onboard support systems 
the company has determined there are no safety issues with these systems 
the company also utilizes ground computer systems and equipment essential for the maintenance of aircraft and the management of flight operations 
the identification  assessment  and remediation phases of the project with respect to these systems and equipment are completed 
the company expects to complete testing by mid internal systems the company s critical internal systems include computer hardware  software  and related equipment for customer reservations  ticketing  flight and crew scheduling  revenue management  accounting functions  and payroll  as well as airport activities including aircraft ground handling  bag handling  and security 
the computing hardware and telecommunications equipment in the company s central data center are essentially year ready at this time 
the majority of the company s vital and critical software systems are either in testing or have already been made year ready 
while some systems are currently in the testing phase  with a small number in the remediation phase  the company expects the majority of vital and critical systems to be year ready by mid third parties the company has categorized its third party vendors with respect to their potential impact on company operations in the event any such third party vendor has year issues which are not dealt with on a timely basis 
the company is also identifying and assessing the impact of year issues as they may affect the vendors businesses which  in turn  could affect the company 
the company has made initial contacts with all of its material third party vendors and is in the process of evaluating their statements of year compliance 
in addition  the company continues to work with other members of the air transport association  the airline industry trade group  to share information and resources regarding vendors which are common to the entire industry 
in management s experience  it is not always possible to obtain written certification of year compliance from third party vendors 
accordingly  in such cases  the company is basing its assessment on its own testing  other materials made available by such vendors  and other publicly available information 
upon the conclusion of such assessment  the company will evaluate the need for contingency plans which may be needed in the event any such vendor cannot demonstrate to the company  on a timely basis  its year compliance 
the company expects this evaluation and assessment will be an ongoing process through the balance of year costs the company has expensed million million in of costs incurred to date related to the year issue 
the total remaining cost of the year project is presently estimated at approximately million  which will be expensed as incurred 
risk of year issues the company believes its project to convert its computer systems to be year ready will be completed in a timely manner and year issues will not have a material adverse effect on operations 
however  it is possible the company s or third parties systems and equipment could fail and result in the reduction or suspension of the company s operations 
the company is currently in the process of developing contingency plans related to internal business critical systems and for those critical relationships with third parties 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the company s systems and equipment or third parties systems and equipment on which southwest relies will be year ready in a timely manner or that contingency plans will mitigate the impact of any failure to complete plans in a timely manner 
the costs of the project  the dates on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications and assessments  and the company s analysis of its risk in this area are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  as well as the cooperation needed from third party vendors and others upon whom the company must rely
