item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december  compared to net sales for the year ended december  increased to  compared to  for the year ended december  unit sales increased in compared to which is more than four times the rate of unit growth in the overall heart valve market 
the two largest revenue increases in over were in france and japan 
combined these two markets represented of the total revenue increase 
the company sells to independent distributors with assigned territories generally a specific country or region who in turn sell the valve to hospitals or clinics 
the company sells in us dollars so currency risk is borne by the distributor 
as the dollar increases in value against the distributor s local currency  the cost of the valve increases for the distributor even though ats does not change the selling price 
for the sales growth over the corresponding period was achieved in spite of significant price competition from other valve manufacturers and the increased strength of the us dollar relative to almost all foreign currencies 
during and the company was selling valves in most developed countries and several lesser developed countries ldc s so sales growth came primarily from increased usage in existing markets 
in and each of the previous years  a portion of the sales increase came from opening new markets as well as increased usage within existing markets 
the average selling price of the valve increased from to given the current strength of the us dollar and the pricing strategies of its competitors the company does not expect to be able to raise prices in prior to january  all sales of valves were to customers outside of the united states 
in and the company has been conducting a clinical study of the valve at fifteen hospitals in the united states 
during the study  valves are provided to the hospitals at prices designed to recover some of the costs of the clinical study 
cost of sales for totaled  or of sales compared to  or of sales for the price of the carbon components contained in the valves sold in decreased as compared to the cost of carbon components contained in the valves sold in based upon the company s internal sales projections  the price of the carbon contained in valves sold in is expected to be higher than in the company purchases pyrolytic carbon components for the valve from carbomedics  inc cmi 
approximately of the total cost of a valve is contained in the cost of the carbon components 
the price of the components is set under a multi year supply agreement between the company and cmi 
the price was established in  and varies according to annual volume and is adjusted annually according to increases in the us department of labor employment cost index 
the company uses the first in first out fifo method of accounting for inventory 
approximately of the valves sold in were made with carbon purchased in under fifo and the remainder with carbon purchased in the cost of carbon components  after giving effect to volume discounts and inflationary adjustments rose in the third contract year  decreased in  rose in and rose in for the seventh contract year the company expects to pay more for carbon components than in gross profit totaled  for the year ended december  or of sales  compared to gross profit of  or of sales for year ended december  the increase in average selling price accounted for most of the gross profit increase 
this improvement  along with the decrease in carbon component prices and operating efficiencies accounts for the gross profit increase 
research  development and engineering expenses totaled  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  the majority of the increase is related to the costs associated with the company s us clinical study 
approximately and of research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  were for testing and outside consulting services related to the valve 
during the year ended december  a significant component of the development expense was for work on an aortic valved graft avg 
the avg is a standard ats medical  inc replacement aortic heart valve sutured at the end of a collagen impregnated dacron tube 
this product extension is used in surgeries where the patient s aorta and aortic valve are damaged or degenerated 
most other valve manufacturers provide a similar product 
this development project was completed in and there was not a similar project expense in the company began human implants in the united states under an investigational device exemption ide in january the company sells the valves to the hospitals involved in the study and the cost of the valve is eligible for reimbursement by medicare and most private pay insurance companies 
the company is responsible for reimbursing the hospital for certain additional tests and procedures required by the clinical protocol 
the estimated total cost of follow up is accrued at the time of the sale as research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended december   an increase from the  reported for the year ended december  the year ended december  included  for separation pay related to the shutdown of the company s subsidiary in glasgow  scotland 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to is in part because salaries and benefits increased in the company had employees at december  compared to employees at december  interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in was the result of lower average investable cash balances during and lower interest rates 
cash on hand at december  is less than the amount on hand at december  interest income in is expected to be approximately less than in the company is investing cash in carbon and the completion of a large quantity of valves in anticipation of the market release of the valve in the united states 
net income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase in operating income in as compared to was the primary factor in the increase in net income 
the company has accumulated net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  provides  in part  that if an ownership change occurs with respect to any corporation with net operating loss carryforwards  such as the company  the net operating loss carryforwards can be used to offset future income only to the extent of the annual section limitation 
an ownership change generally occurs if there has been more than a percent change in the stock ownership of a corporation over a three year period 
the section limitation is an amount determined by multiplying the value of the corporation s stock on the date of an ownership change by the federal long term tax exempt rate in effect for the month of the ownership change 
as a result of section  utilization of all or a portion of a corporation s net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
the company believes that as a result of the company s registered direct equity offering in early and the sale of  shares of common stock in  the company experienced an ownership change  and the company s ability to fully utilize million of its existing net operating loss carryforwards will be restricted to approximately million per year 
due to the application of the annual section limitation and the other provisions of section  some of the net operating loss carryforwards of the company may expire before they can be used by the company to reduce its federal income tax liabilities 
income taxes for years ended december  and are mostly due to alternative minimum tax on earnings 
the alternative minimum tax can be used as a credit against future regular tax liabilities  however  the company has provided valuation allowances against this credit and all of its other tax attributes 
the company will recognize the benefit of its tax attributes when it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
year ended december  compared to net sales totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over the net sales of  reported for the year ended december  unit sales increased from during the exchange rate for many currencies fell in value relative to the us dollar 
in europe  these changes caused a decrease in value for some currencies of as much as 
the consequence of this currency change is the same as a price increase to our distributors 
the company responded in select countries by lowering the dollar price of the valve 
cost of goods sold increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to lower average selling prices 
gross profit increased from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  gross profit as a percent of sales was in and in the decrease in the average selling price per unit was the most significant factor in the erosion of the gross margin 
research  development and engineering expenses totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  during the company completed design and testing on a product extension  the aortic valve graft avg 
this effort accounted for of research and development expense with most of the remainder being spent on the clinical study of the valve 
the company s research efforts in were on improved package design and tooling for valve assembly 
approximately of and of r d expenses related to the clinical study of the valve outside the united states and physical testing of the valve and related consulting to support the company s ide application to the fda 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from primarily two factors in in october the company closed its facility in scotland and consolidated those operations at its plymouth  minnesota headquarters 
one time costs associated with this closing of approximately  were charged to selling  general and administrative expense in second  the company increased the number of employees from in to in in november  the company sponsored the second international symposium on the ats medical heart valve at an expense of approximately  following the company s million stock sale in february and million warrant exercise in march  the company had substantially more cash  cash equivalents and short term investments earning interest 
interest income in increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the company recorded  and  in income tax expense for and  respectively 
these taxes arose from the alternative minimum tax and certain items of income in the united kingdom 
net income increased to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in interest income was the major factor in the increase in net income 
net income per share diluted increased from 
for to 
for weighted average number of shares outstanding increased due to option and warrant exercises  and the sale of shares to itochu corp 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by  from  at december  to  at december  inventory purchases and accounts receivable growth  less the increase in accounts payable and net earnings  caused the company to have negative cashflow from operations 
during the company purchased million of heart valve components in accordance with the terms of its long term supply agreement with carbomedics  inc the supply agreement 
during the contract years and the company is obligated to purchase an aggregate of approximately million of components million in 
the minimum purchases under the supply agreement are not tied to sales of the company s valve and the company does not expect sales of the valve to exceed the minimum purchase requirements under the supply agreement until the valve is approved for sale in the united states 
after the company purchases the minimum required valves under the cmi supply agreement for the year  the company will be obligated under the supply agreement only to buy what it sells 
accounts receivable increased from  at december  to  at december  most of the company s sales have been to customers in international markets and while the company attempts to set standard day terms for receivables  competitive pressures and geographical economic situations have caused the company to selectively extend the terms for payment 
at december   the account balance for one customer was of outstanding receivables 
the company has done business with this customer since and the size of the receivable  while substantial  is consistent with the growth of business in this market and in line with the size of the customer s overall business 
current liabilities increased from  at december  to  at december  the majority of the increase is in accounts payable and is related to the amount owing to carbomedics  inc under the supply agreement 
based upon the company s current rate of sales  its expected obligations under the supply agreement and its expected expenses  the company anticipates that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its capital requirements through beyond the company should be cashflow positive or at worst cashflow neutral barring a significant change in the company s business plan 
the company does not use derivatives and therefore does not face market risk from currency or interest rate changes on these types of instruments 
there would be no impact on the company s operations from interest rate changes on debt instruments since the company has not used debt to finance its operations 
assuming that interest rates on investment grade securities were to decrease by  the company s interest income would decrease by approximately  based on the level of investable funds available to the company at december  year situation the year problem refers to a complex set of problems which may arise when computer hardware or software is unable to distinguish between st century dates and th century dates because the date code fields have been abbreviated into two digits  ie this problem could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of business operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other similar business activities 
as a result  many companies computer systems and software will need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with year requirements 
the potential global impact of the year problem is not known  and  if not corrected in a timely manner  could affect the company and the us and world economy generally 
the company s products  including the ats medical heart valve  do not contain any electronics or software and therefore will not be affected by the year problem 
the company s internal financial  manufacturing and other computer systems are being reviewed to assess and remediate year problems 
the company s assessment of internal systems includes its information technology it as well as non it systems systems which contain embedded technology and are used in manufacturing or process control equipment containing microprocessors or other similar circuitry 
as a result of this review the company determined that some of its equipment and software needed to be upgraded or replaced 
during the company spent approximately  on hardware and software some of which was necessary to eliminate potential year problems 
in addition  the company will take delivery on custom measuring equipment valued at  during the first quarter  the primary purpose of this equipment is to improve processing of the company s products but it will also contain year compliant software 
the company s budget for hardware and software is  including the replacement or upgrade of personal computers  workstations and software which are not currently year compliant 
since substantially all of this hardware and software is being purchased from large  industry leading vendors ie compaq  lotus  and microsoft  the company will rely on vendor certification and internal tests to determine year compliance as opposed to hiring consultants to perform reviews 
such certifications and tests are scheduled to be obtained or completed by the end of the second quarter in addition  during the first quarter of the company is requesting assurances from its major suppliers that they are addressing the year problem and that products purchased by the company from such suppliers will function properly in the year the company has a significant inventory of product components on hand  however  certain key components for the valve are available from a single supplier and a protracted year problem for this vendor could have an adverse impact on the company 
contacts are also being made with the company s major customers 
these contacts with the company s suppliers and customers are intended to help mitigate the possible external impact of the year problem 
however  it is impossible to fully assess the potential consequences in the event service interruption from suppliers occur or in the event that there are disruptions in such infrastructure areas as utilities  communications  transportation  banking and government 
the total estimated cost for resolving the company s year issues is approximately  of which approximately  has been spent through december  the total cost estimate includes the cost of replacing non compliant systems as a remediation cost in cases where the company has accelerated plans to replace such systems 
estimates of year costs are based on numerous assumptions  and there can be no assurance that the estimates are correct or that actual costs will not be materially greater than anticipated 
based upon its assessments to date  the company believes it will not experience any material disruption in its operations as a result of year problems to internal financial  manufacturing and other process control systems  or in its interface with major customers and suppliers 
however  if major suppliers  including those providing component parts  electricity  communications and transportation services  experience difficulties resulting in disruption of critical supplies or services to the company  a shutdown of the company s operations could occur for the duration of the disruption 
the company has not yet developed contingency plans to help provide continuity of normal business operations in the event that problem scenarios arise  but it will assess the need to develop such plans based on the outcome of compliance areas currently under review  and the results of remaining survey feedback from its major suppliers and customers 
assuming no major disruption in service from critical third party providers  the company believes that it will be able to manage the year transition without any material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
there can be no assurance  however  that unexpected difficulties will not arise and  if so  that the company will be able to timely develop and implement an effective contingency plan 
the single european currency a significant portion of the company s sales occur in europe 
effective january  various european countries began utilizing a single currency  the euro 
from january through december  merchants will be encouraged to discontinue using local country currencies and begin using the euro to transact business 
beginning in  it will be required that business in the european community be conducted using the euro 
the company sells to all of its customers in us dollars and does not expect to have accounting system issues relative to currency translation 
the company s selling prices are similar to most of its european distributors and therefore should not cause significant disruption whether in dollars or euros 
the company and its distributors have not completed an analysis of what actions competitors might take as a result of the euro 
europe is a very important market for the company s valve 
disruption or loss of a portion of the company s european business could have a material and adverse impact on the company s financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not use derivatives and therefore does not face market risk from currency or interest rate changes on these types of instruments 
there would be no impact on the company s operations from interest rate changes on debt instruments since the company has not used debt to finance its operations 
assuming that interest rates on investment grade securities were to decrease by  the company s interest income would decrease by approximately  based on the level of investable funds available to the company at december
