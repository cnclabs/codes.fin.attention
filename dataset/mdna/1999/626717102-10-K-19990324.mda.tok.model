a diluted share  compared to net income in of million  a diluted share 
in  the company earned million  a diluted share 
results of operations for the three years ended december   included certain special items that resulted in a net charge of million  a diluted share  in  a net benefit of 
million  with no per share effect  in  and a net benefit of million  
a diluted share  in the special items included an after tax charge of million  a diluted share  from a write down of assets determined to be impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
net income for included earnings from discontinued operations of million  
a diluted share 
this amount was attributable to the activities of the company s farm  timber and real estate subsidiary  which was spun off to the company s shareholders on december   as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
vs 
excluding special items  income from continuing operations totaled million in  
a diluted share  a decrease of million from the million earned in the income reduction was primarily attributable to a million decline in earnings from the company s exploration and production operations 
sharply lower crude oil prices in were the main reason for the reduction 
the company s average crude oil sales price declined by a barrel in  down from oil prices realized in higher crude oil production from new fields in canada and the united kingdom were mostly offset by lower production from maturing us and us oil fields and by selective shut in of canadian heavy oil production 
natural gas sales prices in the united states declined in and us natural gas production was down 
earnings from the company s refining  marketing and transportation operations were down million in  as record levels of finished product sales volumes were more than offset by lower unit margins on product sales in the united states 
the costs of corporate activities  which includes interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher net interest costs offset in part by lower costs of awards under the company s incentive plans 
vs 
excluding special items  income from continuing operations in totaled million  a diluted share 
the results for represented a million improvement compared to income from continuing operations of million  a diluted share  in earnings from the company s exploration and production operations declined million in  primarily due to higher exploration costs 
increases in crude oil production and natural gas sales led to record hydrocarbon production in of  barrels a day on an energy equivalent basis 
however  lower worldwide crude oil sales prices nearly offset the benefit of higher production volumes 
income from the company s refining  marketing and transportation segment was up million in the improvement occurred primarily in the united states  where the effects of lower costs for crude oil and other feedstocks exceeded the decline in sales realizations for the company s finished products 
an improved onstream rate helped the company s us refineries achieve a record level of crude oil throughputs in sales of finished products in the united states were also higher during the cost of corporate activities decreased million in compared to  primarily due to lower costs of awards under the company s incentive plans 
in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december   are presented by segment

partial offsets were provided by higher crude oil production and lower exploration costs 
crude oil production from new fields in the united kingdom brought on stream during the third quarter of and from the hibernia field  offshore newfoundland  which came on stream in late  were partially offset by selective shut in of heavy oil production in western canada in response to lower heavy oil prices and by lower production from mature oil fields in the united states and the united kingdom 
in  a million increase in exploration costs  primarily in the us gulf of mexico and bohai bay  china  accounted for the decline in earnings 
while crude oil production increased and natural gas sales increased in  these favorable production volumes were mostly offset by a decline in the average worldwide crude oil sales price

worldwide crude oil prices began to decline in the fourth quarter of  and the downward trend continued throughout oil prices remain under extreme pressure in early average monthly natural gas sales prices in the united states ranged from to an mcf during for the year  us sales prices averaged an mcf compared to a year ago 
the average price for natural gas sold in canada during was an mcf  essentially unchanged from the prior year  while prices in the united kingdom declined to 
the decline in average uk sales prices primarily resulted from a modification of a long term sales contract effective october  average us natural gas sales prices in were essentially unchanged compared to  prices were up in canada and the united kingdom by and  respectively  during the same period 
us natural gas sales prices have declined sharply in early based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each a barrel and 
an mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining  marketing and transportation segments could be affected differently 
production costs were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel of production during the last three years were as follows 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil the increase in us production cost per equivalent barrel in was attributable to lower production volumes combined with higher workover costs 
the decline in canada in  excluding synthetic oil  was caused by higher oil production at hibernia  voluntary shut in of certain high cost heavy oil production and a lower canadian dollar exchange rate vs 
the us dollar 
the decrease in the canadian synthetic oil unit rate was due to lower maintenance costs  a decrease in royalty barrels due to a lower sales price and a lower canadian dollar exchange rate 
the lower cost in ecuador in was caused by lower energy and other field operating costs during the year 
the decrease in the us cost per equivalent barrel in was attributable to the sale of high cost onshore producing properties in the increase in canada  excluding synthetic oil  was due to an increase in heavy oil production compared to light oil and to higher costs associated with an expansion of heavy oil thermal recovery projects 
the decrease in the cost for synthetic oil in was due to higher gross production volumes and a decrease in royalty barrels caused by lower sales prices 
based on synthetic oil production before royalties  costs per barrel declined in a lower unit cost in the united kingdom in was due to a favorable impact from higher production at t block 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditure totals for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars included in capital expenditures dry hole costs geological and geophysical costs other costs undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization for exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower worldwide hydrocarbon production  while the increase in was mainly due to higher worldwide production 
refining  marketing and transportation earnings from refining  marketing and transportation operations before special items were million in  million in and million in operations in the united states earned million in compared to million in  as average product sales realizations declined more than costs of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks 
us operations earned million in crude oil swap agreements increased earnings by million in and million in uk operations earned million before special items in  million in and million in the improvement in the united kingdom in was caused by a larger decline for refining feedstock costs than for sales prices of finished products  coupled with higher finished product sales volumes 
canadian operations contributed million to earnings compared to million in and million in unit margins sales realizations less costs of crude oil  other feedstocks  refining and transportation to point of sale averaged a barrel in the united states in  in and 
in us product sales were up in following a increase in us margins came under pressure during the second half of  at which time unit margins retreated substantially 
us margins improved considerably in after being under pressure throughout unit margins were very weak in early and the company was experiencing losses in its us downstream operations 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged a barrel in  in and in sales of petroleum products were up in following a decline in sales in both terminal and cargo markets increased in cargo sales in were adversely affected by a turnaround at the milford haven refinery early in the year 
although margins remained relatively strong in  the company s branded outlets still face stiff competition from supermarket sales of motor fuels 
sharp declines in unit margins in the united kingdom in early have led to losses in these operations 
based on sales volumes for and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each 
a barrel 
a gallon fluctuation in unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by million 
the effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s exploration and production segments could be affected differently 
income before special items from purchasing  transporting and reselling crude oil in canada in was down million as lower prices for heavy oil led to production shut ins  which brought about lower pipeline throughputs and fewer barrels available for crude trading activities 
income in was virtually unchanged from as higher pipeline throughputs and better margins on crude oil trucking operations were offset by lower crude trading margins

the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
current financing arrangements are set forth in note d to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect any problem in meeting future requirements for funds 
the company had commitments of million for capital projects in progress at december   including million related to one third of a multiyear contract for a semisubmersible drilling rig capable of drilling in  feet of water 
delivery of the rig is scheduled for environmental the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect the environment and or impose remedial obligations 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including refineries  oil and gas fields  service stations  and terminals  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
under the company s accounting policies  a liability for an environmental obligation is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur years after a liability is recognized 
the company s reserve for remedial obligations  which is included in deferred credits and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  contains certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
if regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  future expenditures could exceed the amount reserved by up to an estimated million 
the company has received notices from the us environmental protection agency that it is currently considered a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites and has also been assigned responsibility by defendants at another superfund site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company has reason to believe that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at the four sites 
the company does not expect that its related remedial costs will be material to its financial condition or its results of operations  and it has not provided a reserve for remedial costs on superfund sites 
additional information may become known in the future that would alter this assessment  including any requirement to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or indications of additional responsibility by the company 
following a compliance inspection in  murphy s superior  wisconsin refinery received from the us environmental protection agency notices of violations of the clean air act 
although the penalty amounts were not listed  the statutes involved provide for rates up to  per day of violation 
the company believes it has valid defenses to the allegations and plans a vigorous defense 
the company does not believe that this or other known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
there is the possibility that additional expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulatory requirements could necessitate additional expenditures at known sites 
such expenditures could materially affect the results of operations in a future period 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous wastes and other chemical substances on a recurring basis 
these costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to remediation and other recurring expenditures  murphy commits a portion of its capital expenditure program for compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are expected to be million in year issues general the year issue affects all companies and relates to the possibility that computer programs and embedded computer chips may be unable to accurately process data with year dates of and beyond 
murphy is devoting significant internal and external resources to address year compliance  and the company s year project project is proceeding well 
in  murphy began a worldwide business systems replacement project using systems primarily from jd edwards company edwards in the united states and the united kingdom  pricewaterhousecoopers llp pw sequel in canada  and for exploration and production operations  applied terravision systems inc artesia in the united states  and efa software services ltd 
prism in canada 
certain us business software systems developed by the company will not be replaced with compliant vendor systems by the year and have been remedied to be year compliant 
remaining hardware  software and facilities are expected to be made year compliant through the project 
none of the company s other information technology projects are expected to be significantly delayed due to the implementation of the project 
project the company has established an enterprise project office epo and has engaged kpmg llp to assist with project management 
the project is primarily being managed by major operating location 
at each location  the project is divided into three major components computer hardware  applications software  and process control and instrumentation embedded technology 
the computer hardware component consists of computing equipment and systems software other than applications software 
applications software includes both internally developed and vendor software systems 
embedded technology includes the hardware  software and associated embedded computer chips other than computing equipment that are used in facilities operated by the company 
the general phases common to all components are inventorying year items  assigning priorities to identified items  assessing the year compliance of identified items  repairing or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant  evaluating and testing required material items  and designing and implementing contingency and business continuation plans as necessary 
material items are those that the company believes to have safety  environmental or property damage risks  or that may adversely affect the company s ability to process and record revenues if not properly addressed 
the inventorying and priority assessment phases of the project were completed during the remaining four phases of the project are in progress and are being performed primarily by employees of the company  with assistance from vendors and independent contractors 
a fourth major component of the project  which involves the review of third party suppliers  customers and business partners third parties  is being managed for all locations by the epo 
this includes the process of identifying and prioritizing critical third parties and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
detailed evaluations of the most critical third parties began in the second quarter of and are scheduled for completion by june   with follow up reviews scheduled for the remainder of the company estimates that this component was on schedule at december  based on the results of evaluations and other available information  contingency plans will be developed as necessary during to address any anticipated year problems related to critical third parties 
a year compliant version of edwards has been fully implemented in the united states and is approximately complete in the united kingdom 
implementation of edwards is ongoing in the united kingdom and final phases are expected to be completed in october a contingency plan will be prepared in early to address the possibility that the last phases of the uk implementation will not be achieved by the end of a year compliant version of artesia was implemented in the united states at the end of and testing was completed in january in canada  the company expects to upgrade and test a year compliant version of prism during the first quarter of  with a compliant version of pw sequel scheduled to be fully implemented in april testing of us offshore production platform systems is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of exploration system upgrades were released by the vendor in early and will be installed and tested by the third quarter of remedy of certain internally developed downstream accounting  customer invoicing and human resources systems in the united states had been completed at december  upgrading and testing of virtually all significant us refining and marketing systems is scheduled to be completed by april  the operator at the company s jointly owned uk refinery is directing that location s year action plan  company employees are monitoring the operator s progress and believe the work is on schedule 
systems at uk marketing terminals are being upgraded to a year compliant version  this work is scheduled to be completed by march  supply and transportation systems in canada are expected to be essentially compliant by march  project summary at january   the overall project is estimated to be complete 
thus far  no material noncompliant year issues have been discovered that were not identified in the completed year inventory 
the material components of the project  except for the final stages of the edwards implementation in the united kingdom  are expected to be nearly complete by june the company does not expect to develop formal contingency plans for project issues that are resolved in accordance with the current schedule 
any unresolved issues that fall significantly behind schedule or that lead to a material risk of system failure will be addressed by contingency plans during costs the company s total cost to become year compliant is not expected to be material to its financial position 
the most likely estimate of the total cost of the project is approximately million  of which million is for the epo including assessment of third parties  million is for miscellaneous hardware replacement  million is for noncompliant system renovations and upgrades and 
million is for embedded technology issues 
it is reasonably possible that total costs could exceed the most likely estimate by up to million 
funds for the project are primarily obtained from internally generated cash flows 
this estimate does not include the company s potential share of year costs that may be incurred by partnerships and joint ventures that the company does not operate  except for an estimated 
million to make murphy s jointly owned uk refinery year compliant 
the cost of implementing edwards in the united kingdom  estimated to be 
million  is also not included in the project cost estimate 
the total amount expended on the project through december   and recorded in selling and general expense in was million  most of which related to the epo 
the remaining cost to complete the year project is estimated to be approximately million 
risks not correcting material year problems could result in interruptions in  or failures of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition by impeding the company s ability to produce and deliver crude oil  natural gas and finished petroleum products  and to invoice and collect related revenues from customers 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from uncertainty about the year readiness of critical third parties  the company is unable to determine at this time whether or not the consequences of possible year failures will materially affect its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year issue  and in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of the company s critical third parties 
the company believes that it is taking reasonable steps to address potentially material year failures  and with completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be greatly reduced 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this year section should be read in conjunction with murphy s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements on page of this form k report 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent is impacted by the weather  and by the fact that delivery of supplies is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
relatively high crude oil and natural gas prices led to upward pressure on amounts paid by the company for goods and services during and conversely  lower commodity prices in have caused a softening of prices for goods and services in recent months 
accounting matters the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
effective january   murphy must recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
a derivative instrument meeting certain conditions may be designated as a hedge of a specific exposure  accounting for changes in a derivative s fair value will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
any transition adjustments resulting from adopting this statement will be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as described under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page of this form k report  the company makes limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific market risks 
the company has not yet determined the effects that sfas no 
will have on its future consolidated financial statements or the amount of the cumulative adjustment that will be made upon adopting this new standard 
outlook planning for is difficult because prices for the company s products remain uncertain 
worldwide crude oil sales prices remain under extreme pressure in early  primarily caused by soft worldwide crude oil demand due to the weak asian economy 
in addition  relatively mild winter weather has led to significantly lower us natural gas sales prices in early the low oil and natural gas sales prices  coupled with weak refining and marketing margins  continue to exert downward pressure on the company s operating results in early the company was experiencing losses in exploration and production and refining  marketing and transportation operations in early in such an environment  constant reassessment of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of  but spending plans have subsequently been revised downward to reflect the effects of the sharp decline in commodity prices seen in late and early the company s present plans call for capital expenditures of million in  of which million or is allocated for exploration and production activities 
geographically  about of the planned exploration and production spending is designated for the united states  for canada  including million for further development of the terra nova oil field and million at syncrude  primarily for expansion of the aurora mine  for the united kingdom  including million for further development costs related to the schiehallion and mungo monan oil fields  for continuing development of oil fields in ecuador  and the remaining for other overseas operations 
planned refining  marketing and transportation capital expenditures for are million  including million in the united states  million in the united kingdom and million in canada 
us amounts include funds for additional stations at wal mart sites 
capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted further to reflect changes in estimated cash flow as progresses

murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
all derivatives used for risk management are covered by operating policies and are closely monitored by the company s senior management 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes and it does not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are traded either with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges 
at december   the company was a party to interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million that were designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the swaps mature in and the swaps require the company to pay an average interest rate of over their composite lives  and at december   the interest rate to be received by the company averaged 
the variable interest rate received by the company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly 
the company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was a negative million at december  at december   of the company s long term debt had variable interest rates and was denominated in canadian dollars
