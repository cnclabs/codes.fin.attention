item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  the company attributes the reduction in event revenue to a decrease in the size of the event market in  including no major spills in its service territory  rather than to reduction in market share 
the company can not predict whether or not this trend will continue into future periods 
total hours billed for site services in was flat from  thus  the decreased business in emergency response was offset by an increase in base business 
pricing in site services decreased from the prior year by  in large part due to the decrease in emergency response business  which tends to be at higher billable rates than other site services work 
revenue for waste disposal decreased due to a decrease in volume and a decrease in pricing 
there are many factors which have impacted  and continue to impact  the company s revenues 
these factors include competitive industry pricing  continued efforts by generators of hazardous waste to reduce the amount of hazardous waste they produce  significant consolidation among treatment and disposal companies  industry wide overcapacity  direct shipment by generators of waste to the ultimate treatment or disposal location  and seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers spending for remedial activities 
the company continues to take pricing actions in response to industry conditions  as it attempts to maintain a competitive mix of price  performance  and customer support services while attempting to return to profitability and growth 
the company attempts to mitigate the effects of price reductions by reducing operating costs 
there can be no assurance that pricing actions will be effective in stimulating higher levels of sales or that cost reduction efforts will offset the effect of pricing actions on the company s gross margin 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues was  in   in and  in other costs of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  was in  in and in disposal costs paid to third parties as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in one of the largest components of disposal costs is the cost of sending waste to other companies for disposal 
in  the costs of sending waste to third parties increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the performance of certain site service projects which generated waste types that could not be disposed of in company owned facilities 
other costs of revenues increased by from to in absolute dollar amount but decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the decrease as a percentage of revenues was partially due to the settlement of an insurance claim in the fourth quarter of for an amount  net of legal expenses  of  this settlement represents a partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the company  relating to peco  as discussed later under environmental contingencies 
the other major component that caused the reduction in other costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues from to was cost reductions relating to occupancy expense 
the cost of sending waste to third parties decreased by in absolute dollar amounts for the year ended as compared to the year ended  however  as a percentage of revenues  there was a slight increase from to due to revenue declines related to pricing being greater than the cost reductions achieved relating to outside disposal 
similarly  other costs of revenues decreased by from to  however  as a percentage of revenues  the decline was less due to revenue decreases due to pricing 
in  the company started implementation of new logistic systems designed to direct waste to the lowest cost processing facility 
the implementation of these systems was completed in the company believes that this has resulted in increased efficiencies relative to the collection  transportation  treatment and disposal of routinely created hazardous waste through its expanded and upgraded chicago facility 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in but declined from  in although selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollar amount in  such expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in  partly due to efficiencies achieved through implementation of information systems and consolidation of administrative tasks 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollar amount was driven by increases in salaries and benefits caused by increases in headcount required to manage higher volumes of waste processed  increases in headcount in sales and marketing to pursue strategic business development initiatives  and increases in compensation to remain competitive in the employment markets in which the company operates 
in addition  the company incurred costs to terminate leases and increased sales and marketing efforts 
the decrease in absolute dollar amount from to was caused by a reduction in headcount among the general and administrative employees  and a reduction in virtually all other components of general and administrative expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in selling expense due to the expansion in the sales force and an increase in royalty expense related to kimball plant volumes 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during to  from  in and  in the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of loans outstanding  which was partly the result of increased levels of business activity 
the slight increase in interest expense in as compared in was due to higher interest rates on some debt in as compared to  which was partially offset by a reduction in the average debt outstanding in as compared to other income 
during the first quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax gain  net of related legal fees  of  resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit 
income taxes 
in  income tax expense of  was recorded on a pre tax loss of  for an effective tax rate of  as compared to income tax expense of  that was recorded on a pre tax loss of  for an effective tax rate of in  and as compared to tax benefits that were recorded on a pre tax loss of  for an effective tax rate of for the year ended sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when  based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence  there is a likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  based upon this review  the company established a valuation allowance for all but  of net deferred tax assets  which was the major cause of the tax expense reported in the tax expense consists of  of state income tax expense  which was primarily caused by tangible property taxes and net worth taxes that are levied as a component of state income taxes  and by providing a valuation allowance of  for net deferred tax assets that existed at december  a valuation allowance was also provided for net deferred tax assets generated in  which had no effect on income tax expense 
the income tax benefit was primarily the result of increasing net deferred tax assets for the future benefit of net operating loss carryforwards 
the actual realization of the net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets depend on having future taxable income of the appropriate character prior to their expiration under the tax laws 
if the company continues to report losses in the future  no income tax benefit for these losses would be recorded 
if the company reports earnings from operations in the future  and depending on the level of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued these earnings  some portion or all of the valuation reserve would be reversed  which would increase net income reported in future periods 
during the ordinary course of its business  the company is audited by federal and state tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments 
the company has received a notice of intent to assess state income taxes from one of the states in which it operates 
the case is currently undergoing administrative appeal 
if the company loses the administrative appeal  the company may be required to make a payment of approximately  to the state 
a decision is expected in the second quarter of the company believes that it has properly reported its state income and intends to contest the assessment vigorously 
while the company believes that the final outcome of the dispute will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations  no assurance can be given as to the final outcome of the dispute  the amount of any final adjustments or the potential impact of such adjustments on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  the company and employees acting on behalf of the company make forward looking statements concerning the expected revenues  results of operations  capital expenditures  capital structure  plans and objectives of management for future operations  and future economic performance 
this report contains forward looking statements 
there are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forward looking statement  and there can be no assurance that such expectations will be realized 
the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors  including the company s ability to utilize its facilities and workforce profitably in the face of intense price competition  maintain or increase market share in an industry which appears to be downsizing and consolidating  realize benefits from cost reduction programs  generate incremental volumes of waste to be handled through its facilities from existing sales offices and service centers  and develop the consulting and information services business 
the future operating results of the kimball incinerator may be affected by factors such as the company s ability to obtain sufficient volumes of waste at prices which produce revenue sufficient to offset the operating costs of the facility  minimize downtime and disruptions of operations  and compete successfully against other incinerators which have an established share of the incineration market 
the company s operations may be affected by the commencement and completion of major site remediation projects  cleanup of major spills or other events  seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers spending for remedial activities  the timing of regulatory decisions relating to hazardous waste management projects  changes in regulations governing the management of hazardous waste  secular changes in the waste processing industry towards waste minimization and the propensity for delays in the remedial market  suspension of governmental permits  and fines and penalties for noncompliance with the myriad of regulations governing the company s diverse operations 
as a result of these factors  the company s revenue and income could vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance 
typically during the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for environmental remediation due to the cold weather  particularly in the northeast and midwest regions  and increased possibility of unplanned weather related plant shutdowns 
in addition  customer factory closings for the year end holidays reduce the volume of industrial waste generated  which results in lower volumes of waste handled by the company during the first quarter of the following year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company participates in a highly volatile industry  with multiple competitors  the major ones of which have taken large write offs and asset write downs and undergone major restructurings during the past several years 
periodically  the company reviews long lived assets for financial impairment 
at the end of  the company determined based on this review that no asset write downs were required  however  if conditions in the industry deteriorate further  certain assets could be determined to be impaired and an asset write off could be required 
also  industry conditions may result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price  as well as that of its competitors 
the company is party to an ongoing lawsuit against the city of chicago challenging the imposition of a waste charge by the city of chicago on every gallon of waste received at the company s chicago facility 
the company maintains that it and not its customers have paid this tax since the company was required to reduce its selling prices in order to meet the disposal prices charged by its competitors whose facilities are not located in the city of chicago and who  therefore  did not charge a similar tax 
since  the company has paid approximately  to the city pursuant to this charge 
the lawsuit challenges the legal authority of the city of chicago to impose the charge 
the company contends the charge is  among other things  an unlawful tax on service occupations in violation of the illinois constitution 
the company is seeking a declaration by the circuit court of cook county that the challenged charge is unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful  an injunction against the city s continued assessment and collection of the charge  and a refund of all charges paid plus interest 
on july  the judge in the case issued in final order declaring the city of chicago waste fee to be unconstitutional under illinois law 
on august  the city filed a motion with the court to reconsider its final order 
on september  the court denied the city s motion for reconsideration of its july final order 
on october  the court granted the company s motion to dismiss the city s affirmative defense of waiver and estoppel with prejudice  and laches and statute of limitations without prejudice 
the city s affirmative defense of voluntary payment was allowed to stand 
the company is now engaged in settlement negotiations with the city of chicago 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  accordingly  no account receivable has been recorded on the books of the company relating to this lawsuit 
environmental contingencies while increasing environmental regulation often presents new business opportunities to the company  it likewise often results in increased operating and compliance costs 
the company strives to conduct its operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including environmental rules and regulations  and has compliance as its goal 
this effort requires programs to promote compliance  such as training employees and customers  purchasing health and safety equipment  and in some cases hiring outside consultants and lawyers 
even with these programs  management believes that in the ordinary course of doing business  companies in the environmental services and waste disposal industry are faced with governmental enforcement proceedings resulting in fines or other sanctions and will likely be required to pay civil penalties or to expend funds for remedial work on waste management facilities 
from time to time  the company has paid fines or penalties in governmental environmental enforcement proceedings  usually involving its waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities 
at december   however  there were no pending governmental environmental enforcement proceedings where the company believes potential monetary sanctions will exceed  the possibility always exists that substantial expenditures could result from governmental proceedings  which would have a negative impact on earnings for a particular reporting period 
more importantly  federal  state and local regulators have the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued power to suspend or revoke permits or licenses needed for operation of the company s plants  equipment  and vehicles  based on the company s compliance record  and customers may decide not to use a particular disposal facility or do business with a company because of concerns about the compliance record 
suspension or revocation of permits or licenses would impact the company s operations and could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
certain company subsidiaries have transported or generated waste sent to sites which have been designated state or federal superfund sites 
as a result  the company has been named as a potentially responsible party at state and federal superfund sites 
fourteen of these sites involve two subsidiaries which the company acquired from chemical waste management  inc chemwaste  a former subsidiary of waste management  inc  and one site involves a subsidiary  which the company acquired from southdown  inc  a public company 
as part of these acquisitions  chemwaste and southdown  inc agreed to indemnify the company with respect to any liability of such subsidiaries for waste disposed of before the company acquired them 
with respect to the other superfund sites  the company has established reserves or escrows  which it believes are appropriate  such that any future settlement costs of lawsuits arising from any or all of the superfund sites are not expected to be material to the company s operations or financial position 
the company had accrued environmental costs of approximately  and  for cleanup of superfund sites at december  and  respectively 
the company operates facilities that are subject to rcra regulation 
under rcra  every facility that treats  stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a rcra permit from epa or an authorized state agency and must comply with certain operating requirements 
of the company s waste management facilities  nine are subject to rcra licensing 
rcra requires that permits contain a schedule of required on site study and cleanup activities  known as corrective action  including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility 
the company s other facilities are regulated under the clean water act and state regulations 
the epa or applicable state agencies have begun rcra corrective action investigations at the company s rcra licensed facilities in baltimore  maryland  chicago  illinois  braintree  massachusetts  natick  massachusetts  woburn  massachusetts  and cincinnati  ohio 
rcra corrective action at the bristol  connecticut  facility was completed in the company is also involved in site studies at its non rcra facilities in cleveland  ohio  kingston  massachusetts  and south portland  maine 
in january  the company entered into a definitive agreement with chemwaste to lease a site previously leased by chemwaste which adjoins the company s chicago facility 
during november  the company acquired the existing improvements on the chemwaste site in exchange for agreeing to share the costs of dismantling an existing hazardous waste incinerator and cleaning up the site 
the improvements on the chemwaste site allowed the company to increase processing capacity at the location and introduce efficiency initiatives relative to collection  transportation  treatment and disposal of routinely created hazardous wastes throughout its facility network 
under the sharing arrangement with chemwaste  the company will manage the rcra corrective action investigation at the site and over a period of years could be required to contribute up to a maximum of  for dismantling and decontaminating the incinerator and other equipment and up to a maximum of  for studies and cleanup of the site 
any additional costs beyond those contemplated by the sharing arrangement during this time period would be borne by chemwaste 
the company had accrued  and  relating to this liability at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the company believes that it would be able to appropriately capitalize as additional purchase cost the remediation expenditures that it may be obligated to make under the agreement 
no estimate can be made as to when the remediation activities will be complete 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company acquired its rcra facilities in bristol  connecticut and cincinnati  ohio from a subsidiary of southdown  inc southdown has agreed to indemnify the company against any costs incurred or liability arising from contamination on site arising from prior ownership  including corrective action 
the following table summarizes non reimbursed environmental remediation expenditures capitalized and expenses incurred relating to the company s facilities for the years ended december  in thousands environmental expenditures capitalized environmental expenses incurred the company expects environmental remediation expenditures of the magnitude incurred for the last three years to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company is also involved in a rcra corrective action investigation at a site in chester  pennsylvania owned by peco energy company peco 
the site consists of approximately acres which peco had leased to various companies over the years 
in  the company acquired by merger a public company named chemclear inc  which operated a hazardous waste treatment facility on approximately eight acres of the chester site leased from peco 
the company ceased operations at the chester site  decontaminated the plant and equipment  engaged an independent engineer to certify closure  and obtained final closure of the facility 
in  the epa ordered peco to perform a rcra corrective action investigation at the chester site 
peco asked the company to participate in the site studies  and in october  the company agreed to be responsible for seventy five percent of the cost of these studies  which was estimated to be in the range of  by  among other things  performing site service work and analytical services required to complete the site studies and providing other environmental services to peco at discounted rates 
the company had provided discounts and credits to peco in the amount of  and  through december  and  respectively 
the company had  and  accrued relating to this liability at december  and no estimate can be made as to when the remediation activity will be completed 
in the fourth quarter of  peco informed the company that they had expended approximately  related to the site 
the company reviewed the expenditures made and believes that it is not responsible for a significant portion of the expenditures made by peco either because i the expenditures made were for remediation rather than corrective action investigation and the results of the corrective action investigation did not link the contamination to the operations of the company or ii the expenditures made were to contain current releases of contamination caused by entities other than the company 
the company is currently discussing the expenditures made by peco with representatives or peco 
the company believes that the ultimate resolution of this dispute will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
while the final scope of work to be performed at these sites has not yet been agreed upon  the company believes  based upon information known to date about the nature and extent of contamination at these sites  that accruals have been established when required and such costs are not expected to have a material effect on its results of operations or its competitive position  and that it will be able to finance from results of operations any additional corrective action required at the sites 
environmental regulations stipulate the amount of transit and holding time that shipments of hazardous waste are allowed 
certain federal agencies  including the epa  are conducting an inquiry concerning certain railcars which were destined for the company s kimball  nebraska incinerator 
several item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued railcars containing waste materials generated by the company s waste treatment plants were not delivered to the company s sterling  colorado rail transfer facility in a timely manner by the railroad company 
the company has cooperated fully with federal and state authorities and has arranged for company personnel to be interviewed and has produced records  documents and other materials concerning the railcars in question 
the company has conducted its own internal investigation and believes that there has been no wrongdoing on the part of the company with respect to the late delivery of railcars 
however  no assurances can be given that the government authorities will not reach a different conclusion or attempt to levy penalties 
year as has been widely discussed in the media  companies around the world are working on resolving the potential problems relating to the year the problem stems from the fact that much of the computer software  computer hardware and control devices produced in prior years provide only two digits with which to record the year 
this may result in these products not functioning or producing unexpected results when the year is recorded as  and the program or device is unable to differentiate whether the represents the year or throughout  the company has been working on identifying and correcting year problems 
although the work is on going  the company has identified potential year issues related to its management information systems  control devices used at its plants  and readiness of vendors and customers for the year starting in  the company began a major upgrade of all management information systems in order to improve the availability of management information with the ultimate aim being better control over costs and better availability of management information  which management believes will yield improved operating results 
as a by product of this upgrade  the company believes that all of its major management information systems are currently year compliant  with the exception of the accounts receivable and human resource systems 
the company has installed an accounts receivable module as part of its new financial software package 
the company is in the process of running the accounts receivable system parallel to the existing system and anticipates that the new accounts receivable system will be fully functional by the end of the second quarter of the company has purchased a human resource system at a cost of approximately  that it expects to be able to install in at this time  the management of the company believes that all major systems will be year compliant prior to the end of the company has also compiled a list of secondary software and hardware that is not year compliant 
although the cost of modifying or replacing the secondary software and hardware that is not year compliant has not been determined  a review of the list indicates that the cost will not be material to the results of operations of the company 
in addition to computer software and hardware  the company utilizes a variety of control devices in its plants  most of which are not date or time sensitive 
based on an inventory of the control devices  the cost of replacing the control devices that are not year compliant is expected to be approximately  the company plans to replace these control devices during regularly scheduled plant shutdowns in the second quarter of the company relies on a large number of primary vendors to supply required products and services 
since the unavailability of key goods and services could potentially disrupt the company s operations  letters have been sent to all primary and secondary vendors to determine their readiness for the year to date of vendors have responded to the company s inquiry and all critical vendors are being individually contacted 
the effort to qualify all primary vendors and certain potentially key secondary item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued vendors as to their readiness for the year problem is on going 
a target date of july  has been established for the company s primary vendors to satisfy such year requests 
a contingency plan for backup vendors is being established and will be implemented for those primary vendors that fail to comply 
the company relies on its customers to pay for services performed within a commercially reasonable period of time 
if the computer systems of customers are not year compliant  there is a possibility that the collection of bills  thus cash flow  could be adversely impacted in the first quarter of in the first half of  the company plans on developing policies and procedures to limit the extension of credit to those customers who cannot represent to the company that their systems are year compliant  so that there is an assurance that customers who owe money at december  will be able to pay their bills in as discussed above  the company is trying to insure that all mission critical software  hardware and control devices are year compliant and that there will be no disruption of service to its client base 
in addition  the company is trying to insure that primary suppliers  key secondary suppliers and significant customers are ready for the year however  due to the pervasive use of computers and control devices throughout all businesses  there is a risk that certain key non compliant year devices will be overlooked by the company  our vendors or our customers  which could adversely affect revenues or cash flow early in the year the company has made significant progress on resolving problems related to the year the securities and exchange commission in release  disclosure of year issues and consequences by public companies  investment advisers  investment companies  and municipal securities issuers  dated august  requires that all companies disclose their most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company has interpreted this to mean that the assumption is that there will be no further future progress on resolving known problems related to the year although the company intends to work diligently to resolve known year problems  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios of not being able to make any further progress on its known year problems would be a decrease in revenue due to disruptions in plant operations  a decrease in cash flow due to inefficient collection of monies owed the company because of the accounts receivable system  a disruption in cash flow due to the company s customers not being able to pay their bills due to their systems being non compliant  and a decrease in revenues due to the inability of the company to obtain required goods and services because of vendors systems being non compliant 
the company will continue to monitor the situation and will continue to develop contingency plans as required 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december  the company generated  in cash from operations even though it lost  for the year  primarily due to non cash expenses of  for depreciation and amortization   for the allowance for doubtful accounts and  for the amortization of deferred financing costs 
additional sources of cash from operations were the result of a  increase in the balance of accounts payable at december  as compared to december   primarily due to increased levels of operating activities  a refund of  of income taxes  and a decrease in prepaid expenses of  partially offsetting these sources of cash from operations were uses of cash of  resulting from increased levels of accounts receivable at december  as compared to december   which was primarily due to increased levels of sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same quarter of the prior year  a decrease in other accrued expenses of  and a decrease in accrued disposal costs of  which was primarily caused by lower levels of waste on hand in december  when compared to december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash generated from operations of  together with  of cash on hand  was used primarily to fund additions to property  plant and equipment  and permits of  and to purchase restricted investments of  the largest component of the purchase of restricted investments was to fund a debt service fund which is discussed later in management s discussion and analysis 
cash to make payments on long term debt of  was obtained by additional borrowings on the revolving line of credit 
federal and state regulations require liability insurance coverage for all facilities that treat  store  or dispose of hazardous waste  and financial assurance that funds will be available for closure of these facilities  should the facilities cease operation  and post closure coverage where required by law 
in  the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company pursuant to the federal risk retention act of this company qualifies as a licensed insurance company and is authorized to write closure  professional liability  and pollution liability insurance for the company and its operating subsidiaries 
investments are held by the captive insurance company as assets against its insured liabilities and are restricted for future payment of insurance claims 
in  the company replaced a portion of the closure insurance issued by its captive insurance company with bonds issued by a bonding company 
this allowed the captive insurance company to remit funds previously classified as restricted cash to the company 
in addition  at december   the company had on deposit collateral of  with a commercial insurance company to provide for closure and post closure costs of its incinerator and landfill 
during  the company renegotiated its agreement with the insurance company to replace collateral with a letter of credit 
the cash from this transaction was released to the company in as a result of these two transactions  the company obtained  the company used these funds  as well as  of additional borrowings under its revolving line of credit  to purchase equipment and improve properties in the amount of  to pay maturities on long term debt of  and to cover cash used in operations of  the deficit from operations are largely the result of a decrease in accounts payable of  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  accounts payable decreased due to the company paying vendors in a more timely basis in as compared to  which allowed for smoother operations 
accounts receivable decreased in proportion to the decrease in selling prices 
in addition  in the company obtained  from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
the company expects capital additions to be approximately  the company believes that it has all of the facilities required by the business for the foreseeable future 
thus  the company anticipates that capital expenditures in will be generally limited to maintaining existing capital assets  replacement of site services equipment  and upgrades of information technology hardware and software 
in september of  the company refinanced its  revolving credit and term loan agreement the loan agreement with a financial institution by i amending the loan agreement to reduce the maximum credit thereunder from  to  and ii guaranteeing  of economic development revenue bonds due september  issued by the city of kimball  nebraska the bonds 
the company used the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds to repay a portion of its outstanding debt under the loan agreement 
that portion was originally incurred to pay for a portion of the costs of the kimball incinerator and landfill  including the prepaid closure insurance programs  as well as the costs of improvements to the facility 
the loan agreement provides for a  revolving credit facility the revolver and a  term promissory note the term note 
the term note is payable in monthly installments of  with the last payment due in january the revolver allows additional borrowing availability to a maximum of  in cash and letters of credit as the term loan is amortized 
letters of credit item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued may not exceed  at any one time 
in june  the term of the revolver was extended from may  to may  under substantially the same terms and conditions

there were no other violations of loan covenants at december  in addition  the bonds contain certain covenants the most restrictive of which require that the company maintain a ratio of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to total debt service of to at december   the debt service coverage ratio was to under the terms of the bonds  the deficiency in the debt coverage did not and will not result in a default  but the company was required to pay funds into a debt service reserve fund held by the trustee for the bonds a total amount equal to the annual debt service for one year on the bonds 
through december   the company had paid  into this fund  as required 
at december   the debt service coverage ratio was to if the debt service coverage ratio of to is met for two consecutive quarters  the payments made into the reserve fund will be returned to the company
