as a result  the assets  liabilities  and business operations of the company as of september  and for the year then ended have changed substantially compared to prior periods presented 
in particular  the most significant differences relate to the following o the and consolidated statement of income included revenues  as well as operating costs and expenses  related to the distributed operations 
in the consolidated statement of income  the operations of the lodging segment have been combined and included as discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
the mds and msls segments of contract services were also part of the distribution to shareholders  but remained part of continuing operations in the historical financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

o on april   the company s board of directors changed the fiscal year from the friday closest to the end of december to the friday closest to the end of august  thereby creating a week transition period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to these substantial differences in the comparability of the company s historical operating results for fiscal year  the transition period and prior fiscal years  management believes that it is meaningful and relevant in understanding the present and ongoing company operations to compare the company s pro forma operating results for fiscal years  and  presented in the introduction section of this report 
these pro forma statements were prepared as if the distribution  acquisition  refinancing and the implementation of the various related agreements entered into with marriott international  inc and sodexho occurred at the beginning of each period 
the pro formas exclude  among other items  certain non recurring costs such as i costs of the distribution of million net of tax in  ii an extraordinary loss related to the early extinguishment of debt of million  after tax  and iii integration and restructuring charges totaling million in and million for see notes through to the consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company  which analyzes the major elements of the company s consolidated statements of operations and financial condition  should be read in conjunction with the detailed information and consolidated financial statements  and related notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this report 
seasonal nature of the company s business the food service and facilities management business has been characterized historically by seasonal fluctuations in overall demand for services  particularly in the education and schools divisions where sales are stronger during the fall and spring 
limited geographic focus the company is not currently expected to expand its international presence beyond canada 
the trademark license agreement entered into by the company and marriott international  inc gives the company the right to use the marriott name in the us and canada and elsewhere only in extremely limited circumstances 
likewise  the company entered into a royalty agreement with sodexho pursuant to which sodexho licenses the right to use the sodexho name in the us and canada 
as a practical matter  since the company will only be allowed to use its corporate name in the us and canada  and since sodexho controls or has a significant interest in companies operating in other countries in the food and facilities management industries  it is unlikely that the company will engage in significant operations outside the us and canada 
as a result  the company will be more susceptible to a downturn in the us and canadian economies than a company that is actively engaged in various other markets 
business strategy the company s key financial objective is to generate higher revenues and increase cash flow from operations through new contract sales  the retention of existing contracts  and improved efficiencies in the company s operations 
this financial objective is designed to build on the performance strengths of the company  which include expanding relationships with existing clients  attracting new business  identifying under penetrated and rapidly growing segments of the food and facilities management industry  and seeking selective strategic acquisition candidates compatible with this objective 
in  the company substantially completed the integration of the number one and number four market leaders in the us food and facilities management services industry 
the focus during the year has been setting common goals and the merging of best practices and business strategies 
the company successfully aligned its management team  consolidated its systems and processes for improved operations  and developed integrated business strategies 
the company is positioned to capitalize on the current trend for outsourcing services 
as increasing cost pressures force organizations to focus on their core business  the demand for outsourcing services is growing 
the total market is estimated at billion in north america  with of potential food and facilities management outsourcing business still self operated 
the company is focusing on building the organization where resources are closest to the units  facilitating the local managers ability to adapt to the clients needs 
additionally  the company wants to focus on the markets and sub markets that have the most growth potential and that match up well with the company s core services 
during the past year  the company made significant progress in segmenting all of its markets in terms of size  penetration  needs  growth and profitability 
the results of this process provide the basis for choosing the steps the company will take to strengthen its leadership position and to target specific high potential markets 
an integral part of the company s business strategy has been the design and implementation of the company wide incentive program  which is predominately based on the achievement of predetermined financial targets and operational performance objectives 
during the transition period  the board of directors granted million shares in the form of incentive stock options to the managing employees of the company 
these grants have extended further down in the management structure than previous grants issued prior to the transactions see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company expects to issue approximately million new stock option awards in the first half of fiscal year  which are anticipated to include one time grants for eligible unit general managers of the company 
in fiscal year  efficiencies in the procurement and distribution processes  when combined with the administrative savings  resulted in an estimated million in aggregate savings for the year 
the company expects that the procurement and distribution process savings will account for approximately two thirds of the estimated million in annual synergies which the company expects to realize by the year while no assurance can be given that this objective will be met  management believes it is attainable as seen in the results for fiscal year anticipated incremental synergies generated in fiscal year are expected to be reinvested during fiscal year the reinvestments  which are targeted primarily for additional sales and management personnel  have already begun 
in addition  the company has undertaken an information systems strategy study to evaluate the current state of its information systems  and consider information technology options 
among the options under consideration is the adoption of certain elements of the technology platform adopted by sodexho alliance 
this evaluation will require additional time to study and review alternatives and their impact on capital investments  earnings  shareholder value and the provisions of the company s debt agreements 
strategic developments in this area are expected to be finalized during fiscal year see item liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following discussion presents an analysis of results of operations of the company for the week period ended september  fiscal year as compared with the week period ended august  the transition period presented in the selected consolidated financial highlights above 
the discussion below also presents an analysis of fiscal years ended january  weeks and january  weeks 
as detailed above  due to the substantial differences in the comparability of the company s historical operating results for fiscal year  the transition period and prior fiscal years  management believes that it is more meaningful and relevant  in understanding the present and ongoing operations of the company  to review the company s pro forma operating results for fiscal years   and  presented in the introduction section of this report 
historical weeks ended september  compared with the weeks ended august  total sales for fiscal year were billion  an increase of billion  or compared with billion for the transition period 
the significant increase between the periods was due to the additional weeks reported in fiscal year  partially offset by the first weeks of the transition period including sales from the marriott distribution services mds and marriott senior living services msls divisions that were distributed to shareholders on march  as detailed in notes through to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the mds and msls divisions  total sales increased billion  or 
solid sales growth in comparable accounts was partially offset by a lower retention rate for the transition period 
retention rates  particularly in the health care and education divisions  improved in fiscal year  which will favorably impact fiscal year s sales growth 
operating profit before corporate items totaled million for fiscal year  more than double the million for the transition period 
excluding million and million in integration and restructuring costs in fiscal year and the transition period  respectively  operating profit would have totaled million for fiscal year and million for the transition period 
this increase was the result of the week difference between the periods as well as increased margins  largely due to purchasing and administrative synergies between the periods 
these increases were partially offset by challenges in the health care industry  which resulted in charges totaling million to operating profit for fiscal year to record additional bad debt reserves due to three client bankruptcies during the year 
corporate items totaled million  an increase of million  or  when compared to million for the transition period 
excluding integration expenses totaling million for fiscal year and integration and restructuring expenses of million for the transition period  adjusted corporate items totaled million and million  an increase of million  or 
this increase reflects the over increase in the number of operating weeks between the periods 
in addition  the benefits from the elimination of certain positions after the transactions along with other administrative synergies were more than offset in the current fiscal year by a one time  million pretax charge related to the resignation of the former chief executive officer and million pretax of year related costs see year 
fiscal year also included the favorable impact from the sale of the company s bright horizons family solutions bfam investment  resulting in a cumulative pretax gain of million  or million after tax per diluted common share 
excluding the year costs  integration expenses and the one time resignation charge  total operating costs  corporate expenses and amortization of intangible assets represented  in the aggregate  of total sales for fiscal year compared with the transition period s comparable period ratio of 
the company anticipates this margin will continue to improve in the periods ahead  as the company continues to realize purchasing synergies 
together with the synergies from administrative actions  these savings are anticipated to reach million annually by fiscal year synergies from both purchasing and administrative actions are estimated to be million in the current year 
anticipated incremental synergies generated in fiscal year are expected to be reinvested during fiscal year the reinvestments  which are targeted primarily for additional sales and management personnel  have already begun 
in addition  the company has undertaken an information systems strategy study to evaluate the current state of its information systems  and consider information technology options 
among the options under consideration is the adoption of certain elements of the technology platform adopted by sodexho alliance 
this evaluation will require additional time to study and review alternatives and their impact on capital investments  earnings  shareholder value and the provisions of the company s debt agreements

historical weeks ended august  compared with the weeks ended january  total sales for the transition period were billion  a decrease of billion  or compared with billion for fiscal year the significant decrease between the periods was due to the decrease in the number of weeks reported  in addition to the billion decrease from the marriott distribution services mds and marriott senior living services msls divisions that were distributed to shareholders on march  as detailed in notes through to consolidated financial statements

this decrease was the result of the week difference between the periods and the million decrease in operating profit from the mds and msls divisions  which were partially offset by increased margins between the periods  especially in the corporate services division from the continued success of the crossroads cuisines marketing strategy 
corporate items totaled million  a decrease of million  or  when compared to million for fiscal year excluding integration and restructuring expenses of million for the transition period  adjusted corporate items totaled million for the transition period  an adjusted decrease of million  or

total loss from continuing operations before taxes was million  excluding million of integration and restructuring charges  for the transition period 
this compares with income from continuing operations before taxes of million for fiscal year  excluding the million pretax loss from the sale of mms uk operations

the company sold senior living properties to investors since the beginning of  retaining long term operating agreements 
operating profits declined as ownership profits from these properties were replaced with managed operating profits 
this reduction in operating profit was offset by a corresponding reduction in interest expense 
mds  which was also part of the distribution on march   had sales move up sharply in fiscal as a result of the addition of several major restaurant customers and the net addition of two new distribution centers 
profits  however  were lower in fiscal due to start up costs associated with the new centers  as well as costs involved in integrating the new business into existing distribution centers 
corporate expenses rose in  due to noncash items associated with investments generating significant income tax benefits  as well as modest staff increases to accommodate growth and new business development 
interest expense increased over fiscal despite lower effective interest rates

discontinued operations  comprising the lodging division  had an operating profit increase of on higher sales  benefiting from favorable conditions in the us lodging market  and contributions from new properties 
the revenue increase resulted from average growth across all brands of eight percent

liquidity and capital resources the company continues to capitalize on its combined market presence as well as focusing on attracting new accounts and enhancing services to sustain growth 
the company is highly leveraged and anticipates that it would have long term unsecured debt ratings  if obtained  below investment grade based on its pro forma financial statements 
the debt resulting from the refinancing contains restrictive covenants and requires grants of security and guarantees by subsidiaries of the company  which limit the company s ability to incur additional debt and engage in certain other activities 
additionally  these debt covenants limit the company s ability to pay dividends 
capital requirements are funded from a combination of existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
additionally  the company anticipates achieving annual cost savings of approximately million pretax by the end of fiscal year  resulting from purchasing actions and administrative synergies 
the anticipated cost savings  which the company estimates were approximately million in fiscal year  will be available to pay down debt and reinvest in the company to fund activities to enhance its competitive position 
anticipated incremental synergies generated in fiscal year are expected to be reinvested during fiscal year these reinvestments  which are targeted primarily for additional sales and management personnel  have already begun 
in addition  the company has undertaken an information systems strategy study to evaluate the current state of its information systems  and consider information technology options 
among the options under consideration is the adoption of certain elements of the technology platform adopted by sodexho alliance

strategic developments in this area are expected to be finalized during fiscal year see item integration and restructuring and item liquidity and capital resources

new accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued in june and will require the company to record derivative instruments  such as interest rate agreements  on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
currently  the company treats such instruments as off balance sheet items 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the specific use of each derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment as stated in the standard 
in june  the financial accounting standards board approved the deferral of the effective date for sfas no 
to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  therefore  sfas no 
will be effective for the company on september   the beginning of fiscal year the impact to the company s financial position of implementing sfas no 
is not anticipated to be material 
year general 
the company is actively addressing potential issues arising from the historical computer programming practice of using two digits rather than four digits to signify dates eg instead of 
this practice could cause the company s owned and operated computer based technology to process dates incorrectly because of an inability to distinguish properly between and  and could result in computer systems failures or miscalculations 
these potential issues are collectively referred to as the year issue 
the year issue could arise at any point in the company s purchasing  supply  processing  distribution and financial chains 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue by the company  its key suppliers  clients and other parties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
year readiness disclosure 
the company began the process of understanding the year issue in the company s board of directors and senior management are committed to minimizing the impact of the year issue on the company s operations 
the company established a year project the project to address the year issue 
the project s steering committee consists of members of the company s senior management  including representatives from each of the company s divisions and most corporate functions 
this steering committee oversees and regularly reviews the status of each of the following areas of concentration for the project o internally developed software o third party software o infrastructure mainframe  personal computers  etc 
o facilities systems o other external systems supply chain and other outside relationships internally developed software  third party software and infrastructure hardware are all information technology it systems 
facilities and other external systems are non it systems 
the steering committee is also tasked with estimating and controlling the associated costs of the project 
additionally  the company established a year project team  led by an experienced project manager  that is responsible for the day to day oversight and coordination of the company s year efforts 
the company s methodology involves eight phases for the project awareness  inventory  assessment  remediation  testing and validation  implementation  contingency planning and crisis management business continuity 
information technology systems the inventory and assessment phases for the it systems began in for internally developed mainframe software  the company not only has completed these two phases  but also has completed testing  third party validation  and implementation of compliant versions of the software 
with respect to other internally developed software  third party software and personal computers  which are used at most of the company s operating locations to support unit level financial and operating systems  the company has completed the inventory and assessment of these items 
the company also completed testing and third party validation of its internally developed software and has acquired compliant versions of all of its third party software 
the company is working with clients and other external entities to validate the compliance status of their systems 
year  continued the rollout of compliant versions of all software and of personal computers to replace those the company owns and the removal of non compliant systems are on schedule to be substantially complete by october  considering the large number and geographic diversity of the company s operating locations  systems considered most critical to ongoing operations and those that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business results of operations  financial condition and cash flow are being given the highest priority 
non information technology systems the company has also surveyed and assessed facilities systems  which include food service refrigeration and food preparation systems that the company manages for its clients 
the company also manages elevators  heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems  and other equipment for its clients pursuant to plant operations and maintenance agreements 
in some health care division accounts the company provides  either directly or through subcontractors  certain maintenance services related to biomedical equipment 
because these facilities systems reside at client sites  they are generally not under the company s control  and responsibility for these systems generally rests with the client 
the assessment of these systems has involved close cooperation between the company and its clients 
with respect to plant operations and maintenance clients  the company is providing certain services to assist its clients in achieving their year objectives relative to their facilities systems 
finally  the company continues to obtain up to date compliance information regarding its vendors and suppliers and is monitoring the compliance status of other external systems that support the different facets of its business  such as utilities  government entities and other service providers 
these systems are not under the company s control 
at this time  the company anticipates sporadic outages of limited duration  however the company believes its contingency plans in place are sufficient to address this degree of potential disruption 
risks 
there are many risks associated with the year issue 
because the company s year compliance depends upon numerous third parties also being year compliant on a timely basis  there can be no guarantee that the company s efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on its business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
the possible consequences to the company of its business partners or the general infrastructure including transportation  government  utilities  and communications not being fully year compliant include temporary facilities closings  delays in the delivery of products  delays in the receipt of key food products  equipment and packaging supplies  invoice and collection delays and errors  and inventory and supply shortages 
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow if the company is unable to conduct its business in the ordinary course 
to manage potential points of failure  the company has developed contingency plans designed to mitigate the potential disruptions that may result from the year issue 
in general  because the company has had much experience with power outages  equipment failures  etc  in its normal course of business  the company believes it is prepared for potential year disruptions 
contingency plans and associated cost estimates are generally complete  and will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
the company believes that its business continuity planning should significantly reduce the adverse effects any disruptions may have 
costs 
the company had originally estimated that the pretax costs to be borne by it to address the year issue would be approximately million principally for modification  testing  validation  project management and contingency and business continuity planning 
these costs are being expensed as incurred and funded from operating cash flow 
through fiscal year  approximately million had been incurred and expensed  and the company now anticipates spending a total of approximately million for this project 
thus  approximately million will be incurred and expensed for this project in fiscal year the company does not separately identify certain internal costs incurred for the project  most of which are related to the company s internal it personnel costs 
the actual costs to be incurred by the company will depend on a number of factors which cannot be accurately predicted  including the extent and difficulty of the remediation and other work remaining to be done  the clients expectations of the company s responsibility to help remediate the clients facilities systems  the availability and cost of consultants  the extent of testing required to demonstrate year compliance  the portion of such costs that may be borne by the company s clients pursuant to existing contractual agreements and the company s ability to timely collect all payments due to it under existing contracts and the severity and duration of the impact of year on the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are not materially affected by changes in interest rates  due to the relatively low balances of borrowings at floating interest rates after adjusting for hedge positions outstanding as well as notes receivable which earn a variable rate of interest see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of the company s debt  totaling billion at september  if interest rates increased by basis points  the fair value of the company s debt would have decreased by approximately million  while a basis point decrease in rates would have increased the fair value of the company s debt by approximately million  based on balances at september
