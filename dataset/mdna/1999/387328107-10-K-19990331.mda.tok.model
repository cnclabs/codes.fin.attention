item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general granite is one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and is engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
the company has offices in california  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  oregon  maryland and utah 
the company s contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies  and private parties 
the company s bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts to the company may vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from construction contracts including construction joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based upon costs incurred and projected costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contracts frequently extend over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided in total when determined  regardless of the degree of project completion 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized in the period when it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion  and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods 
the company s compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
thus  the company may experience an increase in general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and a decrease in less profitable years 
the company s pension contribution in excess of the k matching contributions is at the discretion of the board of directors based on the company reaching certain levels of profitability each year 
current year revenue and backlog 
during the year ended december   revenue increased million to billion 
the branch division revenue increased million to million in  from million in the branch division increase is due primarily to improved market conditions particularly in the private sector  and to a lesser extent  contributions made from flood related emergency work caused by severe winter weather conditions 
heavy construction division hcd revenue increased million to million in  from million in which reflects increased revenue from hcd s portion of the company s interstate rebuild project in utah and various projects added to backlog in the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to million in from million in while decreasing to of the company s total revenue in from in revenue from private sector contracts increased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the company s backlog at december  was million  down million  or from the relatively flat backlog in reflects new awards which offset a reduction due to a full year s work on the company s share of the i corridor reconstruction project in salt lake city  utah which was awarded in the first quarter of work on our million portion of the contract began during the second quarter of and was approximately complete at the end of management believes that approximately of the work in the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during the company believes its bidding opportunities in its major marketplaces remain strong see outlook 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased in to from in the increased gross profit margin reflects the current favorable market conditions as well as the company s interstate rebuild project which reached the completion threshold for profit recognition during the second quarter of revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  incentive compensation  retirement plans  costs associated with the company s estimating and bidding activities  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and decreased from of revenue in  to of revenue in the dollar increase is primarily due to higher profit sharing  incentive compensation and other costs resulting from the company s increased revenue and bidding activities partially offset by the collection of a previously written off bad debt 
the decrease as a percent of revenue is due to the fixed nature of certain expenses and higher revenue from non sponsored joint venture contracts which do not create a corresponding level of administrative expense 
operating income 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased over the contribution due primarily to improved market conditions which increased both the volume of work and the profit margins the division was able to achieve 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income also increased in  primarily due to the impact of the i project reaching the completion threshold for profit recognition as described above 
other income expenses 
other income decreased million to million in the decrease was due to an increase in interest expense resulting from additional borrowings under long term debt agreements and lower gain on sale of property and equipment which was partially offset by higher interest income due to higher short term investments and cash and cash equivalents 
outlook 
as we enter  the company s fundamental business outlook remains very favorable  based on record levels of public infrastructure funding and healthy economic conditions in many of the company s geographic marketplaces 
tea  as we have noted in the past  is the federal transportation bill that will act as a flywheel to drive the various state highway programs for the next five plus years 
according to the us department of transportation  california  the company s largest market  is expected to see a increase in funding during this period over the previous authorizing legislation for surface transportation 
moreover  texas and florida  two additional states where we are actively bidding and building work  anticipate funding increases of and during this period  respectively  also according to the us department of transportation 
we should caution investors  however  that the opportunities that tea will provide for contractors such as granite are just beginning to emerge 
because the cycle for federal money to progress from planning to design to actual construction bids takes time  we most likely will not see any significant increase in bidding opportunities until mid at the earliest 
therefore  considering that profits on a job are not recognized until it is complete  we would not anticipate any meaningful boost to our bottom line from tea funded projects until the year and beyond 
however we believe there will be ample bidding opportunities in the first half of the year from other sources 
increased public infrastructure funding is also getting renewed attention in california  where leaders from both parties in both the assembly and the senate have proposed a package of multi billion dollar bills ranging from bond issues to dedicating a quarter cent of the existing sales tax toward the renovation and construction of roads  bridges and other public facilities 
in fact  governor davis in early march appointed a select committee on infrastructure  a major focus of which will be transportation 
aside from increased bidding opportunities  we believe increased public highway funding will help advance the design build segment of our industry 
highway departments are increasingly sensitive to the public demand to complete projects in the shortest time possible 
mega design build projects like hcd s i reconstruction joint venture in salt lake city  utah give clients many cost and time advantages and in return offer us the opportunity to earn higher than normal gross profit margins  if we execute the work successfully 
a further example of the benefit to the company is the recent award of a design build project in arizona which allowed that state to expedite the use of available tea monies 
additionally  increased bidding opportunities fueled by additional transportation dollars should give both of our divisions the increased latitude to be more selective in targeting those bidding opportunities that meet the company s profitability objectives 
specifically  our heavy construction division has targeted several design build projects to bid this year  including a bridge replacement project in florida  major wharf improvements in south carolina and a water storage project in massachusetts 
hcd will again be actively bidding on transportation projects in its core markets of texas and florida and plans to step up its bidding efforts in new markets including pennsylvania and the carolinas 
hcd and tic  our strategic industrial partner  plan to joint venture a number of opportunities this year  including merchant power and wastewater treatment projects 
looking ahead at the private component of our business  we are encouraged by the underlying strength of california s economic base 
according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy  the state added  new jobs in as a result  california s unemployment rate fell to  the lowest level since before the recession 
furthermore  construction spending grew at double digit rates in  the center noted 
housing markets continued to improve moderately in  the economists noted  although the  new units built in were still less than half of mid s building levels 
to date  we have not seen any significant impact on the california construction marketplace from the economic crisis afflicting asia and south america 
we should remind investors that our business focus is the domestic marketplace  thus we have no exposure to delays or cancellations of overseas projects unlike some companies in our industry 
a healthy private and public california marketplace should provide a strong bidding climate for our branch division 
the california department of transportation expects increased funding from tea to impact its bidding schedules beginning this summer 
arizona has already seen an impact from tea funding 
private and public markets are also expected to stay strong in nevada and utah in we will not  however  benefit financially in from two separate events that contributed to our success in absent in will be a one time boost to earnings of the magnitude that the company received when the i rebuild project in utah reached the completion threshold in the second quarter of secondly  the company in will not benefit from emergency work resulting from el nino that helped the first and second quarters in finally  the company remains focused on growth both internally and externally 
we believe we are working to carry out a strategic plan that puts us in the right place at the right time to capitalize on the exciting opportunities ahead of us 
we will continue to work our plan  focusing on profitable growth through expanding internal operations and strategic acquisitions in an effort to provide an optimal level of value to our stockholders 
prior years revenue and backlog 
during the year ended december   revenue increased million to billion 
the increase in revenue is associated with higher levels of bidding opportunities and awards in our branch division 
the branch division revenue increased million to million in  from million in heavy construction division hcd revenue decreased million to million in  from million in the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to million  or of the company s revenue in  from million  or in revenue from private sector contracts decreased million to million in  and decreased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in during the year ended december  revenue increased million to million due to higher levels of bidding opportunities and awards in our branch division and a full year of utah branch activity in the company s backlog at december  was million  up million  or over the same period in gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased in to from in  due in part to an increase in revenue recognized for contracts that had not reached the completion threshold 
additionally  gross profit in reflected the absence of the san joaquin hills toll road project completed in late which carried a higher than average gross profit margin 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenue in  to million  or of revenue in the increase reflects a higher level of costs to support the company s increased revenue and bidding activities and increased personnel to support the company s expansion into the south east marketplace 
operating income 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased over the contribution due primarily to increased revenue driven by higher levels of bidding opportunities and awards 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income decreased in as compared to  due in part to an increase in revenue recognized for contracts that had not reached the completion threshold 
additionally  hcd s operating income in reflects the absence of the san joaquin hills toll road project completed in late which carried a higher than average gross profit margin 
other income expenses 
other income increased million to million in the increase was due to an increase in the company s equity in the earnings of its affiliates partially offset by higher interest expense associated with higher debt levels and a decrease in gains on sales of property and equipment 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   capital expenditures    working capital    during  cash provided from operations of million was primarily used to purchase million of property and equipment  to purchase short term investments and to pay dividends of million 
changes in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflect profitability and normal variations in the cash flow on contracts and payables 
the company s practice has been to replace and replenish its equipment fleet with cash generated from operations 
cash purchases of property and equipment increased million from to and million from to on march  the company issued senior notes in the amount of million to a group of institutional holders 
the notes are due in nine equal annual installments beginning in and bear interest at per annum 
the company used million of the proceeds of the notes to retire its bank revolving credit notes 
on march   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase  at management s discretion  up to million of its common stock on the open market  exclusive of repurchases related to employee benefit plans 
this authorization amends an authorization previously made in march of through march   shares have been repurchased for a total purchase price of million  including  shares repurchased subsequent to december  the remaining amount authorized of million equates to  shares using the closing market price of on march  the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
the company anticipates that cash generated internally and amounts available under its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its capital and other requirements  including contributions to employee benefit plans  for the foreseeable future 
the company currently has access to funds under its revolving credit agreement which allow it to borrow up to million  of which million was available at december  subsequent events 
on march   the board of directors declared a special dividend of per share of common stock in addition to a per share quarterly dividend  payable on april  to stockholders of record as of march  the quarterly dividend represents a per share increase over the dividends paid in the third and fourth quarter of of per share 
impact of the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the issue arises if date sensitive software recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s information technology systems consist primarily of hardware and software purchased from outside parties 
the vendor for the company s enterprise wide software has informed the company that the version of its software that the company is currently utilizing is year compliant and the company has substantially completed its testing to verify that this is the case and will have its testing reviewed by a third party during the first half of the company is in the process of addressing the year compliance of other software and hardware  including embedded chips  being used in its business 
the company is utilizing a seven step process in addressing compliance of these other systems awareness  inventory of all systems and documentation  assessment to identify any areas of noncompliance  remediation renovation of any noncompliant systems  verification of compliance through testing and or vendor certification  implementation of any necessary changes revealed during verifications  and monitoring of the results of implementation 
the company expects to have completed this process for its non enterprise software and hardware in mid the company has begun the process of identifying and making inquiries of its significant suppliers and large public and private sector customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issues 
the company expects that the process of making inquiries to these significant suppliers and customers will be ongoing through the end of however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies or public agencies with which the company does business will be timely converted  or that failure to convert by another company or public agency would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would be an interruption in work or cash flow resulting from unanticipated problems encountered with the information systems of the company  or of any of the significant third parties with whom the company does business 
the company believes that the risk of significant business interruption due to unanticipated problems with its own systems is low based on the progress of the year project to date 
if unforeseen internal disruptions occur  the company believes that its existing disaster recovery program  which includes the manual processing of certain key transactions  would significantly mitigate the impact 
the company s highest risk relates to significant suppliers or customers failing to remediate their year issues in a timely manner 
relating to its suppliers  the company has identified and will continue to identify alternative suppliers 
the company s suppliers are generally locally or regionally based  which tends to lessen the company s exposure from the lack of readiness of any single supplier 
the risk relating to the company s customers relates primarily to any delay in receipt of payment due to a customer s unresolved year issue 
the company s existing financial resources will help to mitigate such an impact and the company will continue to assess this risk as it receives communications about the year status of its customers 
the company estimates that costs to address the year issue will total approximately  including costs already incurred 
these estimated costs include consulting fees and costs to remediate or replace hardware and software as well as non incremental costs resulting from redeployment of internal resources 
to date  approximately  has been incurred and expensed related to the year issue 
the company s year costs will be funded from its operating cash flows 
the company does not expect its year efforts to have any significant impact on other information technology projects
