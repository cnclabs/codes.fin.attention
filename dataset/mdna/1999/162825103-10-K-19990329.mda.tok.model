item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations all comparisons are with the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
management s discussion and analysis of results of operations has been presented on an as reported basis except for the exclusion in cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expense sg a  of the non recurring and restructuring charges recorded in and the charges which totaled million  represented i pre tax restructuring charges of million of which million was includable in the cost of revenues and million in sg a  and ii pre tax non recurring charges of million of which million was includable in the cost of revenues and million in sg a 
the amount represents a million reversal of the restructuring charge recorded in the table below reflects the income from operations before restructuring and non recurring charges 
accordingly  the discussion that follows speaks to the comparisons in the table through income from operations before restructuring and non recurring items 
thousands net revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    income from operations before restructuring and non recurring charges    restructuring and non recurring charges  income from operations after restructuring and non recurring charges    net revenues by product segment electronic article surveillance    domestic cctv  fire  and burglary    access control    included in the eas amounts are the company s foreign cctv  fire  and burglary which represents approximately   and of the company s total consolidated revenue for   and  respectively 
net revenues the company s unit volume is driven by product offerings  number of direct sales personnel  recurring revenues and  to some extent  pricing 
the company s increasing base of installed systems provides a growing source of recurring revenues from the sale of disposable tags and service revenues 
for fiscal and approximately and  respectively of the company s net revenues were attributable to sales of disposable tags and service to its installed base of customers 
the company s customers are substantially dependent on retail sales which are seasonal and subject to significant fluctuations which are difficult to predict 
the company s sales are impacted by such seasonality and fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced lower sales in the first and second quarters of each year 
furthermore  as major contracts have become a more significant component of revenue  quarterly revenue recognition and earnings will be volatile and susceptible to the timing of the receipt of orders 
during  revenues increased by approximately million or from million to million 
this increase in revenues was due primarily to i increased sales of the company s electronic article surveillance eas product line in north america united states and canada  and to a lesser extent in the company s international retail markets excluding canada  and ii increased sales of the company s cctv fire and burglar products in both the north american and international markets 
in  revenues increased by approximately million or from million to million 
this increase in revenues was due primarily to increased sales of the company s electronic article surveillance eas product line in north america  and ii increased sales of the company s cctv fire and burglar products in both the north american and international markets 
north american net revenues accounted for   and in   and  respectively 
north american eas net revenues increased by million or and million or  in and  respectively 
sales of the company s domestic cctv fire and burglar products increased by million or and million or  in and  respectively 
in  net revenues of the company s access control product line  primarily in the united states  were consistent with the prior year  while in  net revenues increased million or 
international net revenues accounted for   and in   and  respectively 
international net revenues  consisting of eas and cctv fire and burglar  increased by million or and million or in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues during  cost of revenues increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues increased from to 
the increase in the company s cost of sales is primarily attributable to i product mix ie higher growth rate in revenue of lower margin products such as cctv fire and burglar systems  partially offset by the growth rate in revenue from high margin disposable tags during  cctv fire and burglar revenue increased by while disposable label revenue increased by  ii the costs associated with excess capacity in the puerto rico manufacturing facilities resulting from the recent expansion  iii an increase in field service costs to support existing and future revenues  iv higher costs of disposable tags manufactured in japan  and v an increase in research and development activities associated with the development of rfid products 
during  cost of revenues increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues increased to 
the principal elements comprising cost of revenues are product cost  research and development cost  and field service and installation cost 
the components of product cost are as follows material  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
the principal raw materials and components used by the company in the manufacture of its products are electronic components and circuit boards for its systems  and aluminum foil  resins  paper  and ferric chloride solutions for the company s disposable tags 
while most of these materials are purchased from several suppliers  there are numerous alternative sources for all such materials 
the company s general practice is to maintain a level of inventory sufficient to meet anticipated demand for its products 
as a result of the company s expansion of its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the acquisition of the assets of tokai electronics co  ltd 
 capacity is expected to exceed product demand in the near term and negatively impact production costs 
for fiscal year and  field service and installation costs approximated of net revenues 
the company believes that it has and will continue to make product design changes that improve product performance and result in easier installation  thereby reducing these costs as a percentage of net revenues over time 
selling  general and administrative expenses during  sg a expenses increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses decreased by from to 
the higher expenses in dollars were due to million in variable costs selling  commissions  and royalties and sales support costs marketing and customer service and million in support costs finance  administration  legal  mis  and operations 
during  sg a expenses increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses increased by from to 
the higher expenses in dollars were due to million in variable costs selling  commissions  and royalties and sales support cost  million in support costs finance  administration  legal  mis  and operations  and million in costs associated with the terminated ultrak merger 
other income  net other income  net was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
other income  net of million in included million of proceeds from the final settlement of the insurance claim relating to the loss of business income caused by a fire at the company s warehouse facility in france offset by a net foreign exchange loss of million 
other income  net of million in includes i a payment of million from mitsubishi materials corporation in connection with the establishment of a joint product research and development project  ii an insurance claim of million relating to the loss of business income caused by a fire at the company s warehouse facility in france  and iii a net foreign exchange gain of million 
other income  net of million in resulted from net foreign exchange gains 
interest expense and interest income interest expense for remained flat when compared to and at million 
the majority of the interest expense is attributable to the million convertible subordinated debentures issued in october of interest income for fiscal year   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in was a result of a direct reduction in cash and cash investments primarily related to i cash used to purchase the company s common stock in and  ii cash used to support operations in  iii the costs related to the expansion of the company s manufacturing facility in ponce  puerto rico during the second half of  and iv the acquisition of the assets of tokai electronics co  in february income taxes the company s effective tax rate for fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the higher tax rate in was primarily due to certain foreign losses resulting from the restructuring charges for which tax benefits were not expected to be realized  as it was not more than likely that certain tax loss carryforwards would be utilized 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will decrease in as restructuring and cost savings programs decrease the impact of foreign losses on the effective tax rate 
the company s net earnings generated by the operations of its puerto rico subsidiary are substantially exempt from federal income taxes under section of the internal revenue code section and are substantially exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
net earnings net earnings were million or 
per share  million or 
per share  and million or 
per share for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the weighted average number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in the weighted average number of shares from to was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock in the increase in the weighted average number of shares from to was primarily due to the exercise of stock options and an increase in stock options outstanding  offset by the repurchase of common shares in financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs have related to  and are expected to continue to relate to  capital investments  acquisitions and working capital requirements 
the company has met its liquidity needs over the last three years primarily through funds provided by long term borrowings  issuance of convertible subordinated debt  and through two separate issuances of common stock in underwritten public offerings 
the company believes that cash provided from operating activities and funding available under its current credit agreements  should be adequate for its presently foreseeable working capital and capital investment requirements 
the company s operating activities during fiscal generated approximately million compared to approximately million consumed during this change from the prior year was primarily the result of a decreased investment in working capital and long term customer contracts partially offset by approximately million in cash utilized in associated with the restructuring 
the company s comprehensive tag program comp tag is a financial marketing sales program designed to remove capital investment costs as an obstacle to the potential customer s decision to purchase an eas system 
this program is offered to large potential customers in strategic vertical markets who are considering chainwide eas installations 
through the comp tag program  the company internally finances the leasing of equipment to retailers under long term non cancelable contracts  usually three to five years 
customers pay a premium price for an agreed upon minimum number of tags shipped on a quarterly or other periodic basis 
the comprehensive tag price reflects the cost of hardware  disposable rf labels  installation and interest 
comp tag agreements that meet all the necessary requirements for sales type leasing as defined under sfas no 
 are recognized as a sale upon shipment of the eas hardware 
if the terms and conditions specified in the comp tag agreement do not meet all the necessary requirements for sales type lease accounting  then the accounting requires operating lease treatment 
the cash flow impact is independent of the accounting used for the consolidated earnings statement 
in the majority of cases  the company is able to recover equipment and installation costs between months under the five year contract and within a shorter period of time for contracts which run three or four years 
the impact of the comp tag agreement is reflected on the statement of cash flows under two captions i long term customer contracts for those meeting sales type lease accounting  or ii revenue equipment placed under operating lease 
comp tag contracts under the sales type lease accounting method are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
comp tag contracts under the operating lease accounting method are included in revenue equipment on operating lease on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s management has determined that the risks of the comp tag program ie cash outlay  credit risk  equipment  and tag monitoring costs are far outweighed by the acceleration of chain wide installations  which drive market share and faster acceptance of source tagging by manufacturers 
this in turn  reduces the retailers costs of hand applying labels  thereby further increasing the favorable impact to the retailers bottom line 
the company has an existing million multi currency unsecured revolving credit facility 
at december   billion japanese yen approximately million was outstanding under this credit agreement 
these borrowings  along with approximately million from cash on hand  were utilized in february  to acquire the assets of tokai electronics co  ltd  a japanese manufacturer of radio frequency tags  for approximately million 
the company has never paid a cash dividend except for a nominal cash distribution in april  to redeem the rights outstanding under the company s shareholders rights plan 
the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividend in the near future and is limited by existing covenants in the company s debt instruments with regard to paying dividends 
management believes that its anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future can be funded from cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability under the million unsecured revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures during fiscal totaled million compared to million during fiscal this decrease when compared to is primarily due to the plant expansion at the company s main manufacturing facility located in ponce  puerto rico which became operational at the end of the fourth quarter the company anticipates its capital expenditures to approximate million in stock repurchase during  the board of directors approved the purchase of up to or approximately million shares of the company s common stock at an average cost not to exceed per share 
on october   the board of directors authorized the additional purchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock at an average cost not to exceed per share 
as of december   the company has purchased under the program   shares of common stock for an average price of per share  and  shares of common stock for an average price of per share under the program 
exposure to international operations the company exports products for international sales to its foreign subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries  in turn  sell these products to customers in their respective geographic area of operation  generally in local currencies 
this method of sale and resale gives rise to the risk of gains or losses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to reduce the company s exposure resulting from currency fluctuations  the company has been selectively purchasing currency exchange forward contracts on a regular basis 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows the company to shift the risk  whether positive or negative  of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party 
as of december   the company had currency exchange forward contracts totaling approximately million 
the contracts are in the various local currencies covering primarily the company s western european operations along with the company s canadian  and australian operations 
the company s operations in japan  argentina  mexico and brazil were not covered by currency exchange forward contracts at december  during  the company also purchased a series of put options denominated in canadian dollars which gave the company the right  but not the obligation  to convert canadian dollars at a specified exchange rate into us dollars 
these options expire in the company will continue to evaluate the use of currency options in order to reduce the impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on the company s net earnings from sales made by the company s international operations 
the combination of forward exchange contracts and currency options should reduce the company s risks associated with significant exchange rate fluctuations 
other matters statements of financial accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes new standards for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and amends a number of existing standards 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  although the company has not fully completed its evaluation of the impact of this new standard  we do not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
year year readiness the company s year readiness plan is primarily directed towards ensuring business continuity by mitigating any year computer failures that could interrupt business processes  damage customer service  and or cause financial loss 
the plan addresses the year effect on the following areas i information systems  ii the company s product offerings  and iii internal and external supply chain readiness which includes the company s internal manufacturing processes 
the company is involved in an ongoing assessment of year readiness and is undergoing a company wide program of adapting its computer systems and applications for the year this assessment is expected to be substantially complete by april the company s primary applications software has been procured through third party vendors  and the company has begun to address potential year deficiencies through updates provided by the vendors 
the company s other non mission critical information systems and applications software  some of which are not year compliant  are also in the process of being evaluated 
as a result of an evaluation of the company s product lines for year compliance  the company s primary products  comprised of eas products  are not date dependant and therefore  will not require modifications 
the company s current access control products are determined to be compliant 
certain of the company s access control products  which are no longer offered for sale  were determined as not being year compliant 
the company has offered  through its web site at http www 
checkpointacpg 
com ykinfo 
htm  an upgrade path for such non compliant products 
the company s cctv and fire and burglar alarm products are generally purchased from outside vendors and the company is currently working with such vendors to determine compliance 
the company has begun an assessment of year issues associated with its various business partners  including vendors and service providers  and is working with these third parties to identify and mitigate common risks 
the company also recognizes the potential for year issues in external areas such as telephone and communication systems  utilities  banks and alarm systems and is contacting all mission critical business partners to obtain year readiness certifications 
initial responses from mission critical business partners are expected back to the company by april costs costs associated with the year compliance have not been material to date  and the total costs to achieve year compliance are being evaluated 
currently  management estimates the cost to test and remedy the company s information systems to be approximately million 
this estimate includes the acceleration of hardware purchases of approximately million and other expenses consisting primarily of outside year consulting services of million 
however  there can be no assurance that costs will not exceed this level 
the company has begun to determine the potential cost associated with the company s product offerings and supply chain readiness 
the company does not expect these costs to be material 
risks the variety  nature and complexity of year issues  the dependence on technical skills and expertise of company employees and independent contractors and issues associated with the readiness of third parties are factors which could result in the company s efforts toward year compliance being less than fully effective 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
as of the date of this filing  the company has not received any information from its vendors or suppliers  or developed any information internally  indicating that a material adverse impact on its business  results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition is considered likely due to year matters 
while the company believes that it is unlikely to experience a material adverse effect  the company is unable to provide assurances at this time that the consequences of year failures will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the execution of the company s year plan is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty associated with the year problem 
contingency plans the company believes that its program of assessment  correction and testing  along with selected system upgrades will enable it to successfully meet the year challenge 
after completion of the assessment and remediation process  estimated to be june  the company will formalize a contingency plan to address potential failures associated with year compliance 
forward looking statement the foregoing year discussion includes forward looking statements of the company s efforts and management s expectations relating to year readiness 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely affected as a result of the numerous factors described in the above discussion 
conversion to euro currency on january   certain member nations of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted a common currency  the euro 
for the three year transition period  both the euro and individual participant s currencies will remain in circulation 
after january   the euro will be the sole legal tender for emu countries 
the adoption of the euro affects a multitude of financial systems and business applications as the commerce of these nations will be transacted in the euro and the existing national currency 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were derived from emu countries 
the company is currently addressing euro related issues and its impact on information systems  currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
action plans currently being implemented are expected to result in compliance with all laws and regulations 
while the company does not expect the euro conversion will have a material impact on its operations  financial condition or liquidity  there can be no certainty that action plans will be successfully implemented or that external factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
market risk factors fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company enters into exchange forward contracts and purchases options denominated in foreign currency to hedge foreign currency exposure and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow 
see accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions and financial instruments and risk management in the summary of significant accounting policies and note sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices  which are reasonably possible over a one year period  are described below 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices 
the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments 
net fair value of these instruments  which include the company s million subordinated debentures at december  and december  was a liability of million and million  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in interest rates at december  would result in a million decrease in the net market value of the liability 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates at december   would result in a million increase in the net market value of the liability 
the company s million subordinated debentures are also subject to equity price risk 
the fair value of these debentures was a liability of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the year end closing price of the company s common stock  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening in the company s common stock would result in a net increase in the fair value liability of million  while a weakening in the company s common stock would result in a net decrease in the fair value liability of million 
the company s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forwards and options and represent a net asset position of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus other currencies would result in an increase of million in the net asset position  while a weakening of the dollar versus all other currencies would result in a decrease of million 
also subject to foreign currency exchange risk  is the company s million multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   billion japanese yen approximately million was outstanding under this agreement 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million decrease in the liability  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million increase in the liability 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts are used to hedge the company s firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
there are presently no significant restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the company s operations outside the united states
