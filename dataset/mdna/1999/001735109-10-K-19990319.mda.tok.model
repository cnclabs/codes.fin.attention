capital expenditures capital expenditures are those made for assets having a useful life in excess of one year and include replacements including carpeting and appliances and betterments  such as unit upgrades  enclosed parking facilities and similar items 
in conjunction with acquisitions of existing communities  it is the company s policy to provide in its acquisition budgets adequate funds to complete any deferred maintenance items and to otherwise make the communities acquired competitive with comparable newly constructed communities 
in some cases  the company will provide in its acquisition budget additional funds to upgrade or otherwise improve new acquisitions

included in an acquisition budget may be some costs which would otherwise be expensed  such as exterior painting  such items are being depreciated over years 
rehab expenditures the average age of amli s communities was a little more than eight years at the time of its initial offering in  the same as today 
amli intends to maintain the average effective age of its portfolio in this same approximate range by continuing to develop new communities  acquire newly constructed communities  sell selected older properties  co invest selected older properties  rehab desirable  well located older properties after they become years old 
amli has sold three older properties in the five years it has been a public company 
amli s oldest property is now years old 
in september  amli initiated its first community rehab since its initial offering by commencing the rehab of amli at riverbend in indianapolis 
rehab is a capital improvement program undertaken to repair or replace  among other things  the items described previously in the capital expenditures policy at an aggregate cost of at least the greater of  per apartment home or of the value of the entire apartment community 
all costs except costs to routinely paint the interiors of units at turnover associated with a rehab will be capitalized and depreciated over their policy lives 
to the extent a cost would have been expensed had it not been incurred pursuant to a rehab pavement resurfacing  exterior painting  vinyl replacement are the primary such costs  such costs will be depreciated over fifteen years 
rehab expenditures are distinguished from recurring capital expenditures in that they are made on behalf of older properties  are started and completed within a month period  cost a minimum of  per apartment home or of the value of the property being rehabbed  and are generally undertaken only once or twice during the useful life of a given property 
amli s larger properties were built in phases  and the rehabs of these larger properties are anticipated to be done in phases  each extending over consecutive periods not exceeding months 
inflation virtually all apartment leases at the wholly owned communities and co investment communities are for six or twelve months duration 
this enables the company to pass along inflationary increases in its operating expenses on a timely basis 
because the company s property operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization are approximately of rental and other revenue  increased inflation typically results in comparable increases in income before interest and general and administrative expenses  so long as rental market conditions allow increases in rental rates while maintaining stable occupancy 
an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   the company s exposure including the company s proportionate share of its co investment partnerships expense to rising interest rates is mitigated by the existing debt level of approximately of the company s total market capitalization at december  including the company s share of co investment partnerships debt  the high percentage of intermediate term fixed rate debt of total debt  and the use of interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on  of floating rate debt through november and  through february of total debt of the company s floating rate debt 
as a result  for the foreseeable future  increases in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation are anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest and general and administrative expenses 
year the chairman of the securities and exchange commission has asked all public companies to provide thorough  meaningful disclosure regarding their year readiness 
this topic is getting increasing attention as january  gets closer 
as is now widely understood  there is real potential for malfunction by computers and other equipment whose performance is dependent in part on microprocessors 
the company and the service companies have replaced all primary data processing systems within the last thirty months and believe the new systems are year compliant 
the company has commenced testing of its data processing systems  some testing will be complete by march   and all testing is now anticipated to be complete by september  little remedial action is anticipated 
some external consultants are being engaged by the service companies to assist these testing efforts and remedial action  if any is required 
total costs for using outside consultants in this effort is estimated at less than  most of which has yet to be incurred 
the company has undertaken a review of other aspects of its operations that may be affected by the year problem 
in the currently expected worst case scenarios  either a computer program or software could malfunction  or mechanical operations  such as elevators  electronic locking or entry systems and hvac systems  could malfunction 
amli believes that each of these problems can be temporarily corrected manually  and repaired permanently in a short period of time 
the company has contacted all its significant vendors  including banks and companies providing outsourcing services for payroll and benefits administration  to ensure that these vendors are satisfactorily addressing the problem 
the company continues to be of the opinion that there will be no direct material effect on its operating performance or results of operations from the year problem 
although the company intends to diligently continue preparations for year  it is not possible to quantify potential indirect effects resulting from the lack of readiness on the part of others with whom the company conducts its business 
contingency plans have been prepared for use by all community locations and for all departments at amli s corporate offices 
in general  these plans provide for ensuring that hard copy of all significant reports is made at the end of  they describe the manual procedures that will have to be performed during any period of disruption of services or communication  and they provide for inventorying a larger than usual quantity of supplies including computer supplies and fax machines  in case replacements are required as a result of any year casualty

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques
