item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
the financial discussion that follows refers to the impact of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under the section  business combinations  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in particular  in october the corporation merged with first financial corporation ffc  the parent company of a billion federally chartered thrift first financial bank or ffb 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and thus  all consolidated financial data was restated as though the entities had been combined for the periods presented 
in addition  the following discussion focuses on operating earnings 
to arrive at operating earnings  reported results of and were adjusted by the following no adjustments were made for 
operating earnings exclude the merger  integration  and other one time charges merger related charges recorded by the corporation in conjunction with the merger of ffc of million  or million after tax 
this pre tax charge includes a million adjustment to securities for other than temporary impairment  million of conforming provision for loan losses  and million of merger  integration  and other one time charges 
these charges reduced basic earnings per share by and diluted earnings per share by 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

operating earnings exclude a one time pre tax charge of million associated with the recapitalization of the savings association insurance fund saif  a one time pre tax charge of million related to a change in accounting for the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  and an extraordinary after tax charge of  related to early redemption costs on subordinated notes all recorded at ffc 
these charges  million after tax  reduced basic earnings per share by and diluted earnings per share by 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
performance ratios for these periods are also calculated excluding these items 
all per share information has been restated to reflect the for stock split declared april   effected as a stock dividend paid on june   to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  performance summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the operating net income of million earned in basic earnings per share were  a increase over basic operating earnings per share of 
earnings per diluted share were  a increase over diluted operating earnings per share of 
return on average assets and return on average equity were and for  compared to and  respectively  for key factors behind these results were 
taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by  between the annual periods 
the interest rate environment  affected by a flattening yield curve  negatively impacted net interest income 
growth in earning asset volume  and changes in mix toward higher yielding loans and toward lower rate funding  countered the negative impact from the flattening yield curve 

provision for loan losses was essentially unchanged at million for  decreasing  from the million excluding the merger related charge in net charge offs were also unchanged at million  or 
of average loans  for both and the allowance for possible loan losses to loans increased to from at december  and  respectively 

noninterest income was a strong contributor to earnings  increasing million or over excluding securities gains  noninterest income increased million or 
mortgage banking revenues  trust fees  credit card and related fees  and gains on asset sales accounted for the majority of the increase 

noninterest expense increased million  or over personnel expense accounts for of this increase up million over mortgage servicing rights amortization and professional fees are accountable for million of increase  offset partially by decreases in various other categories  particularly business development and advertising 
cash dividends paid in increased by to per share over the per share paid in business combinations the corporation s business combination activity is summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   the corporation completed its acquisition of citizens bankshares  inc citizens  which had million in assets  and operated citizens bank and two consumer finance companies 
the merger  accounted for as a purchase  was consummated through the issuance of  shares of common stock and million in cash 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired  resulting in the recording of million of goodwill 
at december   citizens bank and the consumer finance companies continue operations as wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporation 
in the second quarter of  the corporation anticipates merging citizens bank into its existing banks 
on october   the corporation merged with the billion ffc  which had over bank branches throughout wisconsin and illinois 
ffc s retail product mix had a concentration of real estate mortgage products both traditional mortgage products and home equity loans  credit card and student loans funded primarily with retail interest bearing deposits 
the merger was consummated through the issuance of million shares of common stock and was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
thus  all consolidated financial information was restated as if the transaction had been effected as of the beginning of the earliest reporting period 
ffb operated as a thrift subsidiary of the corporation until fourth quarter on november   the corporation completed the conversion of ffb systems and the distribution of ffb assets into its various affiliates 
on february   the corporation completed its merger with centra financial  inc  which had assets of approximately million 
the transaction was consummated through the issuance of  shares of common stock and was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
however  the transaction was not material to prior years reported results  and accordingly  previously reported results were not restated 
during  the corporation acquired million in assets through four acquisition transactions 
three were accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
goodwill of million was recorded on the fourth transaction  accounted for under the purchase method 
subsequent combination on february   the corporation consummated the acquisition of windsor bancshares  inc windsor  a minnesota bank holding company 
windsor s principal subsidiary is bank windsor  which operates offices in the minnesota communities of minneapolis  nerstrand  sleepy eye and chisholm 
at december   windsor had total consolidated assets of approximately million 
the transaction was consummated through the issuance of  shares of common stock and was accounted for under the purchase method 
it is not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income continues to be the largest component of the corporation s operating income net interest income plus noninterest income  accounting for of total operating income  compared to in the decline in this relationship was a combination of the lower net interest income as further discussed below  and the increase in noninterest income discussed under noninterest income 
net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them 
interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income 
the remainder of this analysis discusses net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis in order to provide comparability among the types of interest earned 
see also tables through for additional information related to net interest income and the net interest margin 
fte net interest income was million in  down  from the million level in the interest rate environment  affected by a flattening yield curve  and competitive pricing pressure negatively impacted net interest income by million 
growth in earning asset volume  and changes in mix toward higher yielding loans and toward lower rate funding countered the negative impact from the yield curve shift with a million increase to fte net interest income 
the yield curve change and the low interest rate environment of residential mortgage lending were factors causing prepayments of mortgage loans to accelerate significantly during this accumulation of funds was invested at lower yields than the assets that were prepaid 
thus  rates decreased interest earned from earning assets by million mostly in loans  with a million decrease  while moderately decreasing interest paid on interest bearing liabilities ibls by million  for a net million decrease to net interest income 
volumes and changes in mix offset most of the impact from the interest rate environment and competitive pricing changes 
earning asset volume increased million  the mix of earning assets shifted towards higher yielding loans average loans growing to represent of average earning assets for versus for  ibls volume increased million  and the mix of ibls shifted towards lower rate deposits average interest bearing deposits growing to represent of average ibls for compared to for 
thus  the growth and composition of earning assets contributed an increase of million to fte net interest income  while the growth of ibls cost an additional million  for a net million increase to net interest income 
the net interest margin  net taxable equivalent interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for  a basis point decline from in the interest spread  or difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate on ibls  decreased basis points to for  offset by a basis point larger contribution from net free funds 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to  while the rate on ibls decreased basis points to for the sensitivity of the asset mix to the flattening of the yield curve described above was larger than the benefit received from the re pricing of liabilities 
the larger contribution from net free funds resulted primarily from a million increase in average balance 
combined  these factors decreased the net interest margin by basis points in loans are the largest component of earning assets 
on average  loans grew million  or  to billion for  and represented of earning assets  compared to for a change in the total yield on the loan portfolio generally will have the largest impact on net interest income 
the yield on total loans decreased by basis points to  after decreasing basis points in versus this was strongly impacted by the high prepayment activity seen in mortgages during  competitive pricing pressure on new loans  and the impact of the flattening yield curve on the yields of new loan production 
deposits are the largest component of ibls 
on average  total deposits grew million  or  to billion 
interest bearing deposits on average grew million to billion for  and represented of ibls  compared to for the deposit growth allowed a lower dependence on costlier wholesale funding 
the cost of interest bearing deposits was down basis points to for  compared to for the cost of wholesale funding was down basis points to for thus  the total cost of funds decreased basis points to for the growth of net free funds the difference between earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  or the amount of funding that does not have a specific interest cost associated with them  and the subsequent contribution from these funds  also increased in combined  these factors helped to offset the decline in the interest rate spread

growth in the corporation s net interest income has historically been the result of growth in the volume of earning assets 
given the merger with ffc  the corporation s balance sheet has higher reliance on mortgage related products loans and mortgage related securities  which has increased the importance of managing interest rate risk  particularly in the rate environment experienced during the corporation uses certain modeling and analysis techniques to manage net interest income and the related interest rate risk position see sections interest rate risk and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the corporation seeks to meet the needs of its customers  yet provide for stability in net interest income in the event of significant interest rate changes

despite increases in deposit balances  service charges on deposits decreased  and retail commission income which includes commissions from insurance product sales  equity brokerage product sales  and the sale of annuities was down  the merger  integration  and other one time charges consist of writedowns taken to record other than temporary impairment of value of securities 
concurrent with the consummation of the ffc merger  the corporation transferred all nonagency mortgage related securities and an agency security  with a combined amortized cost of million  from securities htm to securities afs 
these mortgage related securities were transferred to maintain the existing interest rate risk position and credit risk policy of the corporation 
concurrent with the transfer  the corporation recorded a million pre tax charge to earnings relative to one agency security with an amortized cost of million 
management recorded this other than temporary impairment of value in the fourth quarter of this security is highly complex  comprised of multiple cash flows predominated by an inverse floater tied to libor  for which stress tests indicate that the cash flows are volatile in higher interest rate environments 
the estimated fair value of this security at the time of the other than temporary impairment charge was based on quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics and cash flow valuation techniques 
additionally  the corporation recorded a million pre tax charge on other nonagency mortgage related securities that were transferred to securities afs  with an amortized cost of million  to reflect an other than temporary impairment of value in the fourth quarter of these securities were subsequently sold with no additional loss in january noninterest expense total noninterest expense nie for was million  a million or increase over operating nie excluding merger  integration  and other one time charges

the increase in salary expense reflects base merit pay increases  variable pay increases commissions incentives  transitional overlapping positions as support functions were being centralized  and new positions added 
the fringe benefit increase is attributable to fica taxes  pension and profit sharing expenses 
these fringe benefit increases were a result of higher levels of base compensation

residential real estate loans consist of conventional home mortgages  home equity lines  and second mortgages 
loans of this type are primarily made to borrowers in wisconsin and illinois 
residential real estate loans generally limit the maximum loan to of collateral value 
the real estate mortgage classification also includes commercial real estate  ie  loans secured by multifamily  nonfarm  and nonresidential real estate properties 
loans in this group totaled billion at december   up million or over last year 
commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed below for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multi family properties  community purpose properties  and similar properties 
loans are primarily made to borrowers in wisconsin and illinois 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in known markets and businesses  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans were million at the end of  down million since year end  and comprising of total loans outstanding  down from at the end of the commercial  financial and agricultural loan classification primarily consists of commercial loans to middle market companies and small businesses 
loans of this type are in a broad range of industries

the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations 
within the commercial  financial  and agricultural classification at december   loans to finance agricultural production total million or of total loans 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   no concentrations existed in the corporation s portfolio in excess of of total loans  or million 
real estate construction loans grew million or to million  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of compared to million  or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multi family or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made in markets in wisconsin and illinois in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances

installment loans include short term installment loans  direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans  student loans and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
loans are made to individual borrowers located primarily in wisconsin and illinois 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans 
factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for possible loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
allowance for possible loan losses the investment and loan portfolios are the corporation s primary interest earning assets 
while the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit exposure to the corporation  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  further ensures appropriate management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans

ratio of afll to total loans at end of period the afll represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the afll is based on management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  current economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors which could affect potential credit losses  such as year issues relating to borrowers 
in general  the increase in the afll is a function of a number of factors 
first  while total loan growth was moderate increase from year end to  there was stronger growth in commercial real estate and real estate construction loans which carry greater inherent credit risk described under section loans 
also  nonperforming loans have increased further discussed under section nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned 
nonperforming loans are considered a key indicator of future loan losses 
loans classified as potential problem loans have increased slightly over last year 
loans under watch have increased over last year  in part given consideration of possible year issues of significant customers 
net charge offs have remained unchanged million for and 
finally  million of afll was acquired in the december citizens acquisition 
the allocation of the corporation s afll for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology applied by the corporation  designed to assess the adequacy of the afll  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions and historical losses on each portfolio category 
the indirect risk in the form of off balance sheet unfunded commitments is also taken into consideration 
for  estimation methods and assumptions included consideration of year issues on significant customers 
management continues to target and maintain the afll equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions and emerging systemic factors  such as year issues  on the corporation s borrowers 
management allocates afll for credit losses by pools of risk 
the business loan commercial mortgage  commercial  industrial and agricultural  leases  and real estate construction allocation is based on a quarterly review of individual loans  loan types and industries 
the retail loan residential mortgage  home equity  and installment allocation is based on analysis of historical delinquency and charge off statistics and trends 
minimum loss factors used by the corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agencies 
loss factors for non criticized loan categories are based primarily on historical loan loss experience and peer group statistics 
for  increases were made to the afll allocation for credit card and mobile homes based upon a significantly higher risk profile than other consumer loan categories  and increases in commercial categories were made given the growth in these loan segments and year issues 
the mechanism used to address differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of recent nonperforming loan trends  underwriting trends and external factors 
management believes the afll to be adequate at december  while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the afll may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the afll 
such agencies may require that changes in the afll be recognized when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

net charge offs were million  or of average loans  for both and  and million or of average loans for gross charge offs and gross recoveries for were both up by million  principally the result of a large commercial credit that was charged off and subsequently recovered during loans charged off are subject to continuous review and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal  accrued interest  and related expenses 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is embodied through the ongoing monitoring and reviewing of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
such student loans were approximately million at december  loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact on the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period 
table foregone loan interest years ended december  in thousands interest income in accordance with original terms    interest income recognized    reduction in interest income    potential problem loans are loans where there are doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms 
the decision of management to place loans in this category does not necessarily indicate that the corporation expects losses to occur  but that management recognizes that a higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses 
management does not presently expect significant losses from credits in the potential problem loan category 
other real estate owned increased to million at december   compared to million and million at year ends and  respectively  in part due to the fourth quarter classification of certain bank properties carried as real estate owned 
management actively seeks to ensure properties held are administered to minimize the corporation s risk of loss 
investment securities portfolio the investment securities portfolio is intended to provide the corporation with adequate liquidity  flexibility in asset liability management and a source of stable income 
investment securities  at amortized cost  including those htm and afs  totaled billion at december  and table investment securities portfolio years ended december  in thousands investment securities held to maturity htm us treasury securities  federal agency securities    obligations of states and political subdivisions    mortgage related securities    other securities debt    total amortized cost    total fair market value    investment securities available for sale afs us treasury securities    federal agency securities    obligations of state and political subdivisions   mortgage related securities    other securities debt and equity    total amortized cost    total fair market value    mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate issuances  and an increase in the fair value of fixed rate issuances 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate issuances  a decline in the fair value of fixed rate issuances  and a decline in fair value of adjustable rate issuances to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
the mortgage related security portfolio includes both us government agency issuances and nonagency issuances 
unlike us government agency issued mortgage related securities which include a guarantee of principal and interest payments on the underlying collateral  nonagency securities are generally structured with a senior ownership position and subordinate ownership position s providing credit support for the senior position 
the structure of nonagency mortgage related securities may expose the corporation to credit risk in addition to interest rate risk and prepayment risk as discussed above 
nonagency mortgage related securities afs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management monitors the major factors affecting the performance of nonagency mortgage related securities including  delinquencies  foreclosures  repossessions and recoveries relative to the underlying mortgage loans collateralizing each security  the level of available subordination or other credit enhancements  the competence of the servicer of the underlying mortgage portfolio  and the rating assigned to each security by independent national rating agencies 
concurrent with the consummation of the ffc merger  the corporation transferred all nonagency mortgage related securities and an agency security  with a combined amortized cost of million from securities htm to securities afs 
these mortgage related securities were transferred to maintain the existing interest rate risk position and credit risk policy of the corporation 
concurrent with the transfer  the corporation recorded a million pre tax charge to earnings relative to one agency security with an amortized cost of million 
management recorded this other than temporary impairment of value in the fourth quarter of this security is highly complex  comprised of multiple cash flows predominated by an inverse floater tied to libor  for which stress tests indicate that the cash flows are volatile in higher interest rate environments 
the estimated fair value of this security at the time of the other than temporary impairment charge was based on quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics and cash flow valuation techniques 
additionally  the corporation recorded a million pre tax charge on other mortgage related securities that were transferred to available for sale  with an amortized cost of million  to reflect an other than temporary impairment of value 
these securities were subsequently sold with no additional loss in january in november  the corporation hedged certain agency issued zero coupon bonds held by ffc  with a carrying value of million and a market value of million  by executing various interest rate futures contracts 
these contracts had a notional value of million and would mature in march subsequently  in january  the futures contracts were closed and the zero coupon bonds were sold

this is true for both the business and retail segments of the market 
each year  the corporation s banks offered a number of different products with specific features and competitive pricing 
the deposit products are designed to retain core deposit accounts  attract new customers  and create opportunities for providing other bank services or relationships

included in short term fhlb advances are callable notes that have original maturities exceeding one year 
however  these notes have one year call premiums  which the corporation expects may be called 
the notes payable to banks and other borrowed funds are primarily used to fund residential  commercial  and leasing lending activities at the corporation s residential mortgage  commercial mortgage  and leasing subsidiaries 
liquidity liquidity refers to the ability of the corporation to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the corporation s needs 
the corporation must meet maturing debt obligations  provide a reliable source of funding to borrowers  and fund operations on a cost effective basis 
special consideration is also being given to year liquidity issues see year 
the affiliates and the parent company of the corporation have different liquidity considerations 
banking subsidiaries meet their cash flow requirements by having funds available to satisfy customer credit needs as well as having available funds to satisfy deposit withdrawal requests 
liquidity at banking subsidiaries is derived from deposit growth  money market investments  loan repayments and maturing loans  the maturity of investment securities htm  the maturity or sale of investment securities afs  access to other funding sources and markets  and a strong capital position 
deposit growth is and will continue to be the primary source of liquidity at the banking subsidiaries 
total period end deposits increased million from to the corporation s overall deposit base grew an average of million  or during deposit growth  especially in the core deposit base  is the most stable source of liquidity of a bank 
another substantial source of liquidity is the investment securities portfolio  particularly securities maturing within one year  and principal and interest on mortgage backed securities 
at december   excluding mortgage related securities  the amortized cost of total securities maturing within one year were million 
at the end of  the securities afs portfolio contained million at amortized cost of us treasury and federal agency securities 
these government securities are highly marketable and had a market value of million or of amortized cost at year end 
the loan portfolio is also a source of additional liquidity 
the corporation has million of commercial loans and real estate construction loans maturing within one year and has a steady flow of repayments particularly in the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
additionally  at year end  the corporation had billion of loans secured by to family residential property that could possibly be securitized 
within the classification of short term borrowings at year end  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million compared to million at the end of federal funds are purchased from a sizable network of correspondent banks while securities sold under agreements to repurchase are obtained from a base of individual  business and public entity customers 
the aggregate subsidiary liquidity resources were sufficient in to fund the growth in loans and the investment securities portfolio  and to meet other needs for cash when necessary 
as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures  ie to purchase fixed assets 
liquidity is also necessary at the parent company level 
the parent company s primary sources of funds are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings  and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to stockholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries and satisfy other operating requirements 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in and will continue to be the parent s main source of liquidity 
the dividends from subsidiaries  along with a million change in in net short term borrowed funds  were sufficient to pay cash dividends to the corporation s common stockholders of million in and fund lending activities of nonbanking subsidiaries 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by subsidiary banks without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
additionally  the parent company had million of established lines of credit with nonaffiliated banks  of which million was in use 
of the amount in use  the parent company downstreamed the majority to the corporation s various subsidiaries for their use in funding loans and leases 
the corporation s long term debt to equity ratio at december  was compared to at december   attributable to the moderate increase in use of long term debt from the fhlb 
management believes that  in the current economic environment  the corporation s subsidiary and parent company liquidity positions are adequate 
there are no known trends nor any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result or are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques which measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporate asset liability committee and approved by the corporate board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a basis point immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
the corporation manages interest rate risk through the change in the repricing of investments and purchased funds portfolios 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses two different measurement tools static gap analysis and simulation of earnings 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate now  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan product and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the resulting static gap is the base for the earnings sensitivity calculation 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within over days days days year year total in thousands earning assets loans  held for sale    investment securities  at amortized cost       loans  net of unearned income       other earning assets    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       other interest bearing liabilities      total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap    cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities at december the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and now accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances is considered to be long term and fairly stable and is therefore included in the over year category 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the corporation believes the sensitivity analysis in table and the related discussion shows more directly the impacts on earnings from market risk than the presentation used last year  shown comparatively in table for and interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation is used to create a more complete assessment of interest rate risk 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting after tax income for the next month period is compared to the after tax income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations show that the corporation would have a negative variance of million compared to the base case over the next months in the shock up basis points  while the shock down basis points would result in a positive variance of million 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors  such as changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation process 
this action would include  but would not be limited to  adjustments to the repricing characteristics of any on or off balance sheet item with regard to short term rate projections and current market value assessments 
table reflects the corporation s expected cash flows and applicable yields on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the resulting current fair market value after discounting expected cash flows at existing market rates at december  and  respectively

a net gain of million was recognized in investment securities gains in the first quarter of from these transactions 
additionally  the corporation may enter into interest rate swap agreements to assist in managing interest rate risk 
management s philosophy is to maintain an appropriate rate sensitive asset and liability position to provide for stability in earnings in the event of significant interest rate changes 
there were no interest rate swaps at december  at december  million of pay fixed swaps were in effect converting a fixed rate commercial loan to a variable rate 
capital stockholders equity at december   increased to million or per share compared with million or per share at the end of the growth in stockholders equity in was primarily a function of net income  the issuance of stock in connection with the citizens acquisition  and the exercise of stock options 
offsetting this growth was primarily cash dividends paid and the purchase of treasury stock in relation to acquisitions

cash dividends have increased at a compounded rate during the past five years 
the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic condition in markets served and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios and tier leverage ratios were well in excess of regulatory requirements 
management of the corporation expects to continue to exceed the minimum standards in the future 
capital ratios are included in note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s board of directors bod has authorized management to repurchase shares of the corporation s common stock each quarter in the market  to be made available for issuance in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
the bod authorized the repurchase of up to  shares per quarter and  per quarter  in and  respectively 
in  the bod also authorized the repurchase of up to  shares in connection with two purchase acquisitions 
shares repurchased are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
under these actions the corporation purchased million shares of its common shares in and approximately  shares in for  approximately  shares were repurchased and  shares reissued in connection with employee incentive plans 
for   shares and  shares were repurchased and reissued  respectively  in connection with acquisitions  with the remainder being reissued in connection with the february purchase acquisition of windsor 
management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
the corporation s capital level remains strong  but must also be maintained at an appropriate level that provides the opportunity for a superior return on capital employed 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries to ensure that capital levels are appropriate based on the perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements 
fourth quarter results net income for fourth quarter q was million  up million from the million operating net income earned in the fourth quarter of q 
return on average equity was  up basis points from q  while return on average assets increased basis points to 
primary events of q were a the november conversion of ffb s systems and accounts into the corporation s affiliates  b the december consummation of the acquisition of citizens  and c the october purchase of million in boli 
from a balance sheet perspective  q period end balances were up  with loans increasing million since september   and increasing million since december  the acquisition of citizens accounted for million increase in loans 
deposits at year end were up million over september  balances and up million since year end citizens accounted for million of the deposit increase 
other assets increased principally by the goodwill recorded from the purchase of citizens million and the investment in boli 
at december   the corporation had total assets of billion  an increase of or million over year end citizens accounted for million of the asset growth 
in summary for q versus q on an operating basis  net interest income was down million 
this was primarily a function of the shift in the yield curve between the fourth quarter periods  as discussed previously 
the provision for possible loan losses was down  noninterest income excluding securities gains was up million 
mortgage banking income was the largest contributor to noninterest income growth up million  particularly a result of continued strong mortgage production between the fourth quarters and the growth of the servicing portfolio  and boli contributed million to q noninterest expense for q was up million over q  led by the increase in personnel expense up million  via the combination of increased headcount between the quarters  conversion efforts leading to increased overtime and temporary labor  and sales commissions and other incentives 
data processing expense and supplies and stationery also increased up million on a combined basis particularly due to the q conversion of ffb systems and ffb branches 
professional fees were up million  mostly due to year consulting and conversion related consulting 
taxes were down million between the fourth quarters 
the effective tax rate for q was  lower principally from tax planning strategies which were incorporated into the fourth quarter integration process to allow for the utilization of net operating losses

accounting developments the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
sfas no 
is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is encouraged  but is permitted only as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter that begins after the issuance of the statement 
this statement should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the corporation has not determined whether it will adopt the statement early  yet anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact in the corporation s financial statements 
the fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  this statement requires that after the securitization of a mortgage loan held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
this statement conforms the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans by a mortgage banking entity with the required accounting for securities retained after the securitization of other types of assets by a nonmortgage banking enterprise 
the corporation  as required  will adopt sfas no 
in first quarter  which is not anticipated to have a material impact in the corporation s financial statements 
year the corporation s year project is proceeding on schedule 
the year project relates to systems designed to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the corporation has adopted a centralized approach to addressing the year problem 
the corporation s director of systems and operations has overall responsibility for the year compliance efforts and is assisted by a project management office that is staffed with both internal and external resources 
overseeing the project is a steering committee composed of senior management officials 
monthly status reports are provided to each of the corporation s affiliates and the corporation s board of directors monitors progress on a quarterly basis 
the corporation has dedicated significant internal and external resources to assess  plan and execute a strategy for achieving year readiness 
using the federal financial institution s examination council ffiec year directives that have been published since  the corporation has established policy guidelines and time frames that are used to manage the work effort and guide year compliance decision making 
all project management activities and plans have incorporated the ffiec guidelines published to date 
the corporation s year compliance efforts have included completing an inventory of all products and services that may be affected by year date related issues 
each product or service inventoried has been categorized as mission critical  significant  ancillary or other  depending on its significance to the successful continuance of a business activity 
concurrent with and immediately following the completion of the inventory of products and services  the corporation undertook and completed an awareness project involving all employees  management  boards of directors  and customers of the corporation 
the corporation is adhering to ffiec guidelines for completing year remediation  testing and implementation for all mission critical products and services by june   and for significant products and services by december  the corporation is currently on schedule to complete year compliance activities within these designated timeframes 
the corporation uses national third party service providers and software vendors almost exclusively 
the products and services provided by these organizations have been integrated to provide an overall technology infrastructure for the corporation 
as a result  a large part of the corporation s mission critical product year testing effort is for products processed by service bureaus 
the corporation must conduct year testing with these service bureaus and or verify that the service bureau s systems that the corporation utilizes have successfully completed year tests 
the corporation must determine not only that the service bureau s systems will function properly in the year and beyond  but also test that the specific functions utilized by the corporation will properly perform 
the corporation has no custom developed system code 
therefore  the remediation phase of the corporation s year compliance effort does not include code renovation 
product and service upgrades provided by the corporation s service bureaus and other vendors are the primary remediation strategy 
this also impacts the testing phase of the overall project plan and requires that it will be proportionally larger than a plan which has significant code renovation as its focus 
the corporation has been careful to consider non information technology as well as information technology systems in its approach to year compliance 
non information technology systems include equipment in use in the business areas  which is not defined as computer hardware or peripheral devices 
equipment includes calculators  time clocks  heating ventilating air conditioning  elevators  telephones  facsimiles  satellite dishes  and security devices 
the corporation has contacted vendors of non information technology systems to determine year compliance of these systems and products and anticipates the completion of testing of these systems and products during the corporation has also identified third parties with which it has a material relationship  such as telecommunications  power and other utility vendors 
the impact and status of these services is being reviewed and appropriate steps are being taken to ensure continued operation for all areas 
the corporation s customers who are not preparing for the year may experience a disruption in business that could potentially result in significant financial difficulties 
through the use of personal contacts and questionnaires  the corporation has taken an active role in heightening customer awareness of the year issues  assessing and monitoring material customers year compliance efforts  and taking steps to minimize the corporation s exposure 
material customers include fund takers  fund providers  and capital market and asset management counterparties 
the year readiness of material customers is being monitored by the corporation on a quarterly basis and prospective credit customers are also assessed for year compliance as part of the underwriting process 
additionally  consideration of year credit risk has been incorporated into the corporation s loan reserve methodology 
the estimated costs for year compliance are not expected to have a significant impact on the corporation s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the corporation estimates the total cost of addressing year issues will be approximately million  of which approximately million has been expended as of december  additional expenditures will continue through year compliance costs have been influenced by a heavy reliance on external resources that have been contracted to assist the corporation in the project management  vendor management  and testing phases of its year compliance effort 
scheduled systems upgrades and enhancements which would have taken place  notwithstanding the year compliance process  have not been included in the estimated year costs  even though certain of these expenses may result in year solutions 
management of the corporation believes that the potential effects on the corporation s internal operations of the year compliance effort can and will be addressed prior to the year however  if required product or service upgrades are not made or are not completed on a timely basis prior to the year  the year issue could disrupt normal business operations 
normal business operations could also be disrupted if third party servicers  upon which the corporation depends for services  including service bureaus  payment systems  utilities  etc  encounter difficulties relating to the year issue 
the most reasonable likely worst case year scenarios foreseeable at this time would include the corporation temporarily not being able to process  in some combination  various types of customer transactions 
this could affect the ability of the corporation to  among other things  originate new loans  post loan payments  accept deposits or allow immediate withdrawals  and  depending on the amount of time such scenario lasted  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation 
because of the serious implications of these scenarios  contingency plans have been established and are being monitored for all mission critical products to mitigate the risks associated with any failure to successfully complete year compliance renovation  validation  or implementation efforts 
additionally  a business resumption contingency plan is being developed to mitigate risks associated with the failure at critical dates of systems that support core business processes 
a liquidity contingency plan is being written and will be tested  including working with the federal reserve to ensure that adequate currency will be available to meet anticipated customer needs  as well as ensuring adequate access to funding as needed by the corporation 
the year business resumption contingency plan is designed to ensure that mission critical core business processes will continue if one or more supporting systems fail and would allow for limited transactions  including the ability to make certain deposit withdrawals  until the year problems are fixed 
the costs of the year project and the date on which the corporation plans to complete year compliance are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events such as service bureaus and other vendors plans  the availability of certain resources including internal and external resources  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved at the cost disclosed or within the timeframe indicated  and actual results could differ materially from these plans 
factors that might affect the timely and efficient completion of the corporation s year project include  but are not limited to  vendors and service bureaus abilities to adequately correct or convert software and the effect on the corporation s ability to test these systems  the availability and cost of personnel trained in the year area  the ability to identify and correct all relevant computer programs  and similar uncertainties
