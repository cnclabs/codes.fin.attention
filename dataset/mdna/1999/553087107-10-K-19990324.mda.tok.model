year the company has implemented an enterprise wide plan to address year yk issues across all of its technology platforms as well as to reasonably assure that its critical business partners are prepared for business continuity beyond january  the phases of the company s work plan are assessment  role definitions  inventory and analysis  coding  testing and implementation confirmation 
the majority of system modifications and conversions have been completed 
the company is working closely with its business partners and suppliers to ensure alignment in addressing the yk issue 
the company has completed the modifications  testing and implementation of its main insurance and financial systems  making these applications yk compliant 
additionally  system wide yk simulations are scheduled throughout the cost to address yk issues is expected to be less than  and is being expensed as incurred 
costs associated with yk were  in the fourth quarter of and have totaled  through december  state of readiness the company has completed the assessment  role definition and inventory and analysis phases which encompass hardware  software third party and internally developed  embedded technologies  and non information technologies it systems 
the majority of identified critical internally developed it systems have been modified  tested and implemented 
the remaining systems are scheduled for implementation during the first half of the company is addressing yk compliance of third party it vendors through a combination of written correspondence and internal testing 
all identified critical third party it vendors have been contacted and asked to document compliance 
all yk compliance by material third party vendors has been either internally tested by the company or documented by the third party 
the company is currently planning the implementation for any necessary modifications based on vendor comments 
the company has contacted related non it parties to ensure yk compliance 
the company believes failure of non it systems would not have a material effect on the company s operations 
material third party relationships the company relies on continued normal operations of entities such as brokers  reinsurers  banks  money managers and benefit plan administrators 
plans have been developed to ensure alignment with these business partners  even though disruption relating to these institutions would not have a material effect on operations or financial performance 
contingency plans the company plans to leverage existing disaster recovery plans relating to technology and business continuity 
both sets of plans will be reviewed in as to their application to the yk issue 
in addition  contingency plans are being developed in conjunction with the scheduled simulations of critical information technologies 
other the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its underwriting guidelines and will  where appropriate  exclude yk exposures 
the company believes  as a basic principle of insurance  that non fortuitous losses are not covered under its policies of insurance even without specific exclusions 
with respect to its domestic insurance operations  if underwriting reveals an acceptable risk  an endorsement will be attached that affirmatively grants yk coverage under the professional liability coverage part  and excludes yk under the general liability coverage part 
with respect to reinsurance contracts  it is unusual to apply specific yk exclusions to these contracts and there may or may not be such exclusions in the original policies  depending on exposure  class of service or industry  and original coverage 
for these reasons  the company believes that its exposure to yk claims is not material 
however  because of lack of legal precedent  it is impossible to predict what  if any  exposure insurance companies may ultimately have for yk claims whether coverage for the issue is specifically excluded or included 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  most specifically changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company does not utilize derivative or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following analysis presents the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and or foreign currency exchange rates 
the range of changes in interest rates used in the analysis reflects the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
this discussion of market risks related to the company s consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in interest risks 
the effect of actual changes in these risk factors may differ materially from the company s estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  the company also faces risks that may be either non financial or non quantifiable  eg  credit risk 
such risks are not included in the following analysis 
the company has a comprehensive and diversified investment portfolio 
the company s invested assets are held primarily as fixed maturities which are available for sale  short term investments and preferred stocks 
accordingly  these assets are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk 
the fair value of the company s short term investment portfolio at december  approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the short term investment portfolio  and was not materially different from the december  carrying value 
at december  the fair value of the company s fixed maturity and preferred stock portfolio was  million versus an amortized cost basis of  million 
the estimated fair value of the fixed maturity and preferred stock portfolio resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points at december  would be approximately  million or a decrease of 
the company utilizes several outside investment advisory companies in the management of the portfolio 
this portfolio  which is not hedged  consists primarily of us dollar denominated  investment grade  taxable and tax advantaged fixed maturity securities 
the primary objectives of the portfolio are to provide the company with a stable  long term  after tax yield with sufficient quality and liquidity to meet its cash flow needs and to provide an after tax total return to meet its profit objectives 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to several primary reasons  including its united kingdom based subsidiaries which incur expenses denominated in british pounds sterling and hold invested assets in foreign currencies which result primarily from business generated in foreign currencies 
while there is exposure to several currencies  the predominant exposure is in british pounds sterling 
as of december  the company estimates that overhead and other payables of approximately million per month which must be paid in british pounds sterling are to be paid throughout the next year by its uk subsidiaries 
the british pounds sterling are to be purchased periodically throughout the year  usually with us dollars  and a hypothetical strengthening of the british pound sterling versus the us dollar of would increase the cost of these purchases by approximately million throughout the year 
the company does monitor the foreign currency markets and could purchase british pounds sterling in advance if appropriate due to market conditions 
the company also holds invested assets in foreign currencies which result primarily from business generated in foreign currencies and thus expose the company to foreign exchange currency risk 
the predominant exposure is in british pounds sterling 
revenues from our business in foreign countries are the primary source of funds for our purchase of these investments 
the company purchases these investments as a natural hedge against insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency  effectively reducing foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
the company does have a net unhedged foreign currency exposure in its invested assets of approximately million british pounds sterling 
a hypothetical weakening of in the british pound sterling versus the us dollar would result in a loss of value of approximately million 
management reviews its foreign currency exposure risk on a monthly basis and is of the opinion that other foreign currency exchange risk is not material 
in december  the company completed a private placement of million year  mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities capital securities of mmi capital trust i  a subsidiary of mmi 
the capital securities pay a dividend of  semiannually  in arrears and have a maturity date of december  total proceeds were million  net of expenses 
the carrying value of the capital securities is million as of december  these securities had a fair value of million at december  a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value to approximately million 
the company manages its market risk by matching the projected cash inflows of assets with liabilities 
for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to reasonably match durations consistent with the company objectives of maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for necessary liquidity  return and diversification 
the estimated fair values at current market rates discussed above for financial instruments subject to interest rate risk are the same as those in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value at the adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates are calculated using discounted cash flow methods and duration modeling  where appropriate 
the foreign currency exposure risk analysis assumes a year end spot rate on the british pounds sterling of at december  this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of interest rate and price changes may differ significantly from those shown in the analysis 
the sensitivity is further limited as it does not take into consideration any actions the company could take in response to or in anticipation of movements in interest rates or prices 
effect of inflation the primary effect of inflation on the company is implicitly considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  particularly for claims where there is a long period between reporting and settlement 
the actual effect of inflation on the company s results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  the company believes that loss and lae reserve levels and the company s rate making process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
forward looking information certain matters referred to above regarding yk  market risk and inflation contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  the general business community s readiness for the yk and the company s potential underwriting exposure to yk claims as well as prospective changes in price levels  interest rates and foreign exchange rates are difficult to predict 
to that extent  mmi claims the protection of the disclosure liability safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of
