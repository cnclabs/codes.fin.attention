item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview historically  the company s net sales and its sales practices had been substantially affected by the amount of capital available to acquire its inventory of engines and components 
in developing its business  the company has emphasized the rapid sale of whole engines rather than obtaining maximum profit margins on each particular sale 
the proceeds of its initial public offering on november  has enabled the company to continue to build its inventory to support increased sales and to sell its inventory on a more strategic basis to capitalize on the fluctuations in demand for engines and components caused by seasonal and other factors 
in order to enable the company to sell engines and components which it did not have the capital to acquire  the company entered into an agreement on september  with parati corporation parati providing for parati s acquisition of new and surplus aircraft engines for disassembly and resale by the company the parati agreement 
the parties acquired pratt whitney engines under the parati agreement 
the parati agreement provided for an equal sharing of gross profits between the company and parati following the recovery by parati of all costs borne by parati and the recovery by the company of all overhaul costs borne by the company 
accordingly  since such date  the company s cost of sales include the portion of the gross profit due parati from the sale of engine parts of disassembled aircraft engines subject to the parati agreement 
net sales under the parati agreement were approximately million and approximately  in and  respectively 
the cost of the engines acquired by parati under the parati agreement was approximately million 
the company and parati terminated the parati agreement on august  and the company does not intend to utilize similar agreements to acquire engines or components in the future 
the company records whole engines held for resale at the lower of cost or market 
gross margin on whole engine sales has fluctuated significantly from period to period  and can be expected to do so in the future  as a result of the conditions and circumstances under which whole engines are sold 
for example  the company may opportunistically sell whole engines at margins lower than those realized by the company on its component sales to capitalize on market demand or to broaden its customer base 
engine parts and airframe components acquired by the company are initially recorded at cost 
cost of sales relative to engine parts and airframe components shipped are recorded during an initial period following disassembly of the related whole engine or aircraft at the company s historical ratio of cost of sales to net sales for engine parts from such engine types or at the company s estimated ratio of cost of sales to net sales for airframe components 
thereafter  management evaluates the remaining engine parts and airframe components  estimates future sales and related overhaul costs and  if necessary  adjusts the ratio of costs of sales to net sales on a prospective basis 
thereafter  the company records the cost of each engine part and airframe component sold at the time the related net sales are recognized  based on such ratios 
the company has recently expanded its product line to include higher thrust models of the jtd series of engines and other high thrust engines  such as the cfm engine 
these higher thrust engines are more expensive than the engines historically sold by the company 
as the company s net sales increase  the company expects that related operating expenses will increase at a lower rate  thereby creating higher operating margins 
on december   the company amended its employment agreements with donald graw and jaime levy 
the rate of compensation for each of them was reduced from the prior level of of adjusted net income as defined in such agreements approximately  and million  respectively  for each of them in and  to provide for annual base salaries of  and  for messrs 
graw and levy  respectively  for an initial term of three years expiring december the company also terminated its status as an s corporation on this date and became subject to federal and state income taxes 
historically  the company did not record a provision for income taxes as a result of its s corporation status for and and recorded a  net benefit for income taxes in on november   the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its class a common stock at an offering price of per share the offering 
of the shares of class a common stock offered thereby   shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by sragowicz foundation  inc on december   the company sold an additional  shares of its class a common stock at an offering price of per share price upon the exercise of an underwriters over allotment option 
the company received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
of this amount  million was used to repay outstanding indebtedness   was used for payment of accrued compensation and the remainder is being used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the purchase of surplus aircraft and engines and components for the company s inventory and the funding of the acquisition of complementary businesses 
see liquidity and capital resources 
on december   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  avteam engine repair corp  completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of m m for an aggregate purchase price of million and the issuance of  shares of class a common stock 
concurrent with the acquisition  the company made a debt repayment of million to m m s lender 
the acquisition was financed from available cash and avteam s existing credit facility with bank of america  na the credit facility 
avteam utilized substantially all of its available borrowings under the acquisition portion of the credit facility for the acquisition  and had additional availability of approximately million under the credit facility at december  avteam is considering a number of options to provide additional capital for its business activities after the acquisition  including refinancing the credit facility  pursuing strategic partnerships with other aviation related companies and raising additional capital through the offering of debt or equity securities 
until additional capital is provided  avteam may forego the purchase of certain aircraft engines  engine parts and airframe material for resale 
as a result  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected during such period

for the last days of amounted to million 
the increase in available inventory for sale helped fuel the growth in net sales

net interest expense increased to  in from  in as a percentage of net sales  such expense decreased to in from in the increased interest expense is a result of higher borrowing levels prior to the initial public offering in october  in order to increase the amount of inventory available for sale 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of liquidity has been from financing activities and cash flow generated by operations and  to a lesser extent  from consignment sales 
during  the company used approximately million in operating activities  principally for the purchase of inventory 
net cash provided by financing activities  derived primarily from borrowing on the credit agreement mentioned below  was million in in may  the company launched a program in conjunction with third party financing sources under which the company leases aircraft engines to its customers  which has increased the company s liquidity and provides working capital for the purchase of additional aircraft engines 
on april   the company  as borrower  and aafs and avteam engine repair corp  as guarantors  entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america  na  as administrative agent the lenders  pursuant to which the lenders agreed to make available to the company a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the credit facility consists of i a working capital revolving loan facility the working capital revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to million and a ii an acquisition revolving loan facility the acquisition revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the working capital revolving loan facility is being used by the company to finance working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes

as of december   the company has drawn an aggregate of million under the working capital revolving loan facility and million was drawn under the acquisition revolving loan facility 
at december   the company had additional availability of approximately million under the working capital revolving loan facility and no availability under the acquisition revolving loan facility 
on july   the company entered into an agreement with nationsbanc leasing corporation nblc whereby the company sold three pratt whitney jtd engines to nblc for approximately million and subsequently leased back such engines for a period of five years at fixed monthly payments 
on april   the company added two additional jtd engines to this agreement 
net proceeds were approximately million 
the company  at its option  may repurchase any of these engines at a predetermined percentage of the original leased amount 
the proceeds from the sale of these engines were used by the company to reduce the outstanding balance of its credit facility with nationsbank 
on february   the company repurchased one of the engines in order to sell it to a third party leasing company 
on november   the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its class a common stock at an offering price of per share 
of the shares of class a common stock offered thereby   shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by sragowicz foundation  inc on december   the company sold an additional  shares of its class a common stock at an offering price of per share price upon the exercise of an underwriters over allotment option 
the company received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
of this amount  million was used to repay outstanding indebtedness   was used for payment of accrued compensation and the remainder is being used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the purchase of surplus aircraft and engines and components for the company s inventory 
the company has established a capital expenditure budget of approximately million during  including approximately million for additional engine tooling and technical manuals for m m aircraft services  approximately  for enhancements to the company s management information systems  approximately  for warehouse improvements at m m aircraft services  approximately  for additional machinery and equipment and  for additional office furniture and equipment 
the company s principal working capital requirements relate to the acquisition of inventory and carrying of receivables 
the company believes that its present levels of inventory quantities will be adequate to support its sales and leasing activities and the part requirements for its mro business for the near future 
a portion of the growth in inventory from to was planned in anticipation of the additional demand for parts by the repair and overhaul segment of the business and the company s expansion into higher thrust engines 
also a portion of the inventory growth was as a result of the purchase of a dc whole aircraft which is in the process of being disassembled and the purchase of additional whole engines which are expected to be leased or sold during on december   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  avteam engine repair corp  completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of m m for an aggregate purchase price of million and the issuance of  shares of class a common stock 
concurrent with the acquisition  the company made a debt repayment of million to m m s lender 
the acquisition was financed from available cash and avteam s existing credit facility with bank of america  na avteam utilized substantially all of its available borrowings under the acquisition portion of the credit facility for the acquisition  and had additional availability of approximately million under the credit facility at december  avteam is considering a number of options to provide additional capital for its business activities after the acquisition  including refinancing the credit facility  pursuing strategic partnerships with other aviation related companies and raising additional capital through the offering of debt or equity securities 
until additional capital is provided  avteam may forego the purchase of certain aircraft engines  engine parts and airframe material for resale 
as a result  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected during such period 
seasonality the company believes that demand for engines and components is seasonal  with increased demand during the summer months 
this seasonality exists because aircraft engine performance is directly related to ambient temperature as temperatures rise it is more difficult for aircraft engines to perform properly 
as a result  certain aircraft engines are removed from service during the summer months due to the failure of those particular aircraft engines to comply with exhaust gas temperature limitations 
aircraft engines of the same type and model can have different performance capabilities 
the summer months also include peak travel periods during which aircraft utilization levels are high 
in addition  the timing of whole aircraft engines sold  which have a substantially greater purchase price than the installed parts and components  may cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results 
the company has in the past and may in the future experience substantial quarterly fluctuations in sales as a result of these seasonal effects 
impact of year the company believes that it has prepared its computer systems and related software to accommodate data sensitive information relating to the year the company expects that any additional costs related to ensuring such systems and software to be year compliant will not be material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
in addition  the company is discussing with its vendors and customers the possibility of any difficulties which may affect the company as a result of its vendors and customers ensuring that their computer systems and software are year compliant 
to date  no significant concerns have been identified 
however  there can be no assurance that no year related computer operating problems or expenses will arise with the company s computer systems and software or in the computer systems and software of the company s vendors and customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risks from these interest rate fluctuations through regular operating and financing activities 
the company utilizes variable rate debt as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s variable rate debt had a carrying value of million 
the fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value because the variable rates approximate market rates 
a increase in the period end interest rate would have a negative impact of approximately  on the company s results of operations 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing costs 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in the future 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
the company s policy is to not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not to be a party to any leveraged financial instruments
