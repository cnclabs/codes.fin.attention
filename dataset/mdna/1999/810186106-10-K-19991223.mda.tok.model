item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scotts is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care  professional turf care and professional horticulture businesses in the united states and europe 
our operations are divided into three business segments north american consumer  professional and international 
the north american consumer segment includes the lawns  gardens  growing media and ortho business groups 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus on our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  to create demand to pull product through the retail distribution channels 
during fiscal  we spent million on advertising and promotional activities  which is a significant increase over fiscal spending levels 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus over the past several years  and we believe that scotts continues to receive a significant return on these increased marketing expenditures 
for example  sales in our consumer lawns business group increased from fiscal to fiscal  after having increased from fiscal to fiscal we believe that this dramatic sales growth resulted primarily from our increased consumer oriented marketing efforts 
we expect that we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and to increase consumer marketing expenditures in the future to drive market share and sales growth 
scotts sales are seasonal in nature and are susceptible to global weather conditions  primarily in north america and europe 
for instance  periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales but can create increased demand for pesticides 
periods of dry  hot weather can have the opposite effect on fertilizer and pesticide sales 
we believe that our recent acquisitions diversify both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
on september   scotts entered into a long term marketing agreement with monsanto for its consumer roundup r herbicide products 
under the marketing agreement  scotts and monsanto will jointly develop global consumer and trade marketing programs for roundup r and scotts has assumed responsibility for sales support  merchandising  distribution  logistics and certain administrative functions 
in addition  in january scotts purchased from monsanto the assets of its worldwide consumer lawn and garden businesses  exclusive of the roundup r business  for million plus an amount for normalized working capital 
these transactions with monsanto further our strategic objective of significantly enhancing our position in the pesticides segment of the consumer lawn and garden category 
these businesses make up the ortho business group within the north american consumer segment 
we believe that these transactions provide us with several strategic benefits including immediate market penetration  geographic expansion  brand leveraging opportunities and the achievement of substantial cost savings 
with the ortho acquisition  we are currently a leader by market share in all five segments of the consumer lawn and garden category lawn fertilizer  garden fertilizer  growing media  grass seeds and pesticides 
we believe that we are now positioned as the only national company with a complete offering of consumer products 
the addition of strong pesticide brands completes our product portfolio of powerful branded consumer lawn and garden products that should provide scotts with brand leveraging opportunities for revenue growth 
for example  our strengthened market position should create category management opportunities to enhance shelf positioning  consumer communication  trade incentives and trade programs 
in addition  significant synergies have been and should continue to be realized from the combined businesses  including reductions in general and administrative  sales  distribution  purchasing  research and development and corporate overhead costs 
we have redirected  and expect to continue to redirect  a portion of these cost savings into increased consumer marketing spending to support the ortho r brand 
over the past several years  we have made several other acquisitions to strengthen our global market position in the lawn and garden category 
in october  we purchased rhone poulenc jardin  a leading european lawn and garden business  from rhone poulenc for approximately million 
this acquisition provides a significant addition to our existing european platform and strengthens our foothold in the continental european consumer lawn and garden market 
through this acquisition  we have established a strong presence in france  germany  austria and the benelux countries 
this acquisition may also mitigate  to a certain extent  our susceptibility to weather conditions by expanding the regions in which we operate 
in december  we acquired asef holdings bv  a privately held netherlands based lawn and garden products company 
in february  we acquired earthgro  inc  a northeastern us growing media producer 
in december  we acquired levington group limited  a leading producer of consumer and professional lawn fertilizer and growing media in the united kingdom 
in january  we acquired the approximate two thirds interest in miracle holdings limited which the company did not already own 
miracle holdings owns miracle garden care limited  a manufacturer and distributor of lawn and garden products in the united kingdom 
these acquisitions are consistent with our stated objective of becoming the world s foremost branded lawn and garden company 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
dollars are in millions except per share data 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of income and expense as a percentage of sales for the three years ended september  fiscal year ended september  sales cost of sales gross profit commission earned from agency agreement advertising and promotion selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles restructuring and other charges other income expense  net income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income before extraordinary items extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt net income preferred stock dividends income applicable to common shareholders the following table sets forth sales by business segment for the three years ended september  north american consumer lawns gardens growing media ortho total  professional international consolidated   fiscal compared to fiscal sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal sales of billion 
on a pro forma basis  assuming that the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin  levington and earthgro acquisitions had occurred on october   pro forma sales for fiscal were billion  an increase over fiscal pro forma sales of billion 
as discussed below  the increase in sales on a pro forma basis was primarily driven by exceptional growth in the consumer lawns business group and strong revenue growth within the consumer gardens and growing media business groups 
north american consumer segment sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of nearly over fiscal sales of million and an increase of over fiscal on a pro forma basis 
sales in the consumer lawns business group within this segment were million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal sales of million 
the continued dramatic revenue growth in the consumer lawns business group is being driven by increases in consumer oriented marketing efforts such as advertising  consumer research and packaging improvements  which have increased category growth and market share 
sales in the consumer gardens business group increased to million in fiscal due to several successful new product introductions and the extension of the advertising season for all purpose miracle gro r 
sales in the growing media business group increased to million  or on a pro forma basis 
significantly higher levels of advertising and promotional spending drove this revenue growth which resulted in increased sales for value added potting soils in particular 
sales in the ortho business group were million in fiscal which is an increase of on a pro forma basis 
professional segment sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal the professional segment consists of two businesses the proturf r business which provides turf care products to golf courses  athletic fields  and related facilities  and the horticulture business which provides plant care products to professional nurseries and growers 
the decrease in fiscal sales in this segment was reflected in the proturf r business  which changed its distribution model earlier in the year  electing to market and deliver products through distributors rather than directly to customers 
short term interruptions associated with this change and the discontinuance of certain commodity products resulted in lower sales volumes in fiscal international segment sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily the result of the rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions in fiscal the increase in sales on a pro forma basis was which was primarily due to revenue growth in the european professional and rhone poulenc jardin businesses  partially offset by sales declines in the uk consumer business caused by supply chain interruptions resulting from the integration of the recently acquired businesses 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  pro forma sales in fiscal would have been higher than fiscal selling price changes did not have a material impact on scotts results of operations for fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal on a pro forma basis  gross profit in fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was driven by improved raw material costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher volumes in fiscal fiscal gross profit also reflected the following charges restructuring and other charges of million as discussed below  start up costs of million associated with the upgrade of certain domestic manufacturing facilities  demolition costs of million associated with the removal of certain old manufacturing facilities  unplanned production outsourcing costs of million  the loss of a composting contract of million  and unfavorable inventory adjustments of million 
the commission earned from agency agreement in fiscal of million was generated from our marketing agreement with monsanto for exclusive international marketing and agency rights to monsanto s consumer roundup r herbicide products 
the commission earned under the agreement is based on ebit as defined by the agreement generated annually  net of an annual fixed contribution payment  by the global roundup r business 
advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million over fiscal advertising and promotion expenses of million 
the recently acquired ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses contributed million and million  respectively  to this increase 
the remaining increase reflects continued emphasis on building consumer demand through consumer oriented marketing efforts  and is highlighted by  and increases in advertising and promotional spending in the consumer lawns  consumer gardens and consumer growing media businesses  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and promotion expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
the recently acquired ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses contributed million and million  respectively  to this increase 
the significant components of the remaining million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses are additional information systems expenses of million for year remediation and million for enterprise system implementation efforts  increased bad debt expenses of million  primarily resulting from the bankruptcy of hechinger  increased marketing  selling and administrative costs within the consumer lawns  consumer gardens  and consumer growing media businesses of million to support higher sales volumes  costs of million associated with changes in distribution arrangements in france  costs to integrate the ortho business of million  increased research and development spending of million  largely in support of the acquired ortho business  and increased legal and environmental charges of million  primarily for costs associated with the environmental matter at our marysville site 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to additional intangibles resulting from the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal were million  which represents severance costs associated with the change in distribution methods within the proturf r business of the professional segment 
in connection with this restructuring  approximately in house sales associates were terminated in fiscal approximately million of severance payments have been made to these former associates during fiscal  the remaining million is expected to be paid in fiscal restructuring and other charges in fiscal were million  million of which is identified separately within operating expenses  million of which is included in cost of sales and million of which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
see fiscal compared to fiscal below for further discussion of these restructuring and other charges 
other income expense for fiscal was income of million compared to million of expense for fiscal other income in fiscal represents royalties received under license agreements for the use of some of our trademarks 
other expenses in fiscal represent losses on the sale of fixed assets and foreign currency  partially offset by royalty income described above 
legal and environmental provisions of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  have been reclassified from other income expense to selling  general and administrative expenses 
income from operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to operating income realized from the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses and significant improvements in the consumer lawns and growing media businesses  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative and amortization expenses described above 
interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal interest expense of million 
the increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings to fund the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions and higher working capital levels to support the growth of the businesses 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in foreign dividends remitted which provided excess foreign tax credits in fiscal as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  in conjunction with the ortho acquisition  in january we completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under our bank facility  were used to fund the ortho acquisition and repurchase our outstanding million senior subordinated notes due august we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of the notes of million  including a call premium of million and the write off of unamortized issuance costs and discounts of million 
we reported net income of million for fiscal  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million for fiscal  or per share on a diluted basis 
excluding the impact of the extraordinary loss discussed above  earnings per share for fiscal were on a diluted basis 
excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges taken in fiscal as well as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  earnings per share for fiscal were on a diluted basis 
the significant increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the tremendous revenue growth being experienced by many of our consumer businesses  the commission earned under the roundup r marketing agreement and the accretion of the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses to earnings 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales in fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal sales of million 
on a pro forma basis  assuming that the levington and earthgro acquisitions had occurred on october   fiscal sales would have been billion  an increase of million  or  over fiscal pro forma sales of billion 
the increase in these pro forma sales was driven primarily by significant increases in sales in the consumer lawns business group and the professional segment as discussed below 
north american consumer segment sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal sales of million 
sales in the consumer lawns business group within this segment increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  reflecting significant volume growth year to year in our turf builder r line of products driven by increased consumer oriented marketing efforts 
sales in the consumer gardens and consumer growing media business groups increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  from fiscal to fiscal the increase in the consumer growing media business group was primarily the result of the earthgro acquisition made earlier in fiscal the increase in sales for the consumer gardens business group was driven primarily by strong volume  particularly in the osmocote r and miracle gro r product lines  which we believe was due to increased advertising 
increases were also due to the introduction of certain new products 
on a pro forma basis  including the earthgro acquisition  sales in the consumer growing media business group increased from fiscal to fiscal more importantly  we made a strategic decision to emphasize sales of higher margin  value added products and to deemphasize sales of lower margin landscape products 
selling price changes did not have a material impact in the north american consumer segment in fiscal professional segment sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal sales of million 
this increase in sales was primarily reflected in the proturf r business and resulted from increased volumes as a result of emphasizing more technological support for customers and new product introductions 
international segment sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal sales of million 
after considering the levington acquisition  on a pro forma basis  sales in the international segment increased from fiscal to fiscal  primarily in the european professional business 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal gross profit of million 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was of sales for fiscal  compared to of sales for fiscal fiscal gross profit reflects a charge of million  or of fiscal sales  for restructuring and other charges as discussed below 
also impacting fiscal gross margins were start up costs of million associated with the upgrade of certain domestic manufacturing facilities  demolition costs of million associated with the removal of certain old manufacturing facilities  unplanned production outsourcing costs of million  the loss of a composting contract of million and unfavorable inventory adjustments of million 
the aggregate impact of these items  approximately million  was offset by favorable raw material pricing of approximately million 
advertising and promotion expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal advertising and promotion expenses of million 
on a pro forma basis  including the levington and earthgro acquisitions  advertising and promotion expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal this increase reflects continued emphasis on building consumer demand through consumer oriented marketing efforts  and is highlighted by and increases in advertising and promotion expenses in the consumer lawns business group and international segment excluding the levington acquisition  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and promotion increased slightly to  compared to for the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  over selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal on a pro forma basis  including the levington and earthgro acquisitions  selling  general and administration expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to several factors the assumption of selling  marketing  research and development and administrative functions related to acquired businesses  information systems expenses of million for year compliance and million for the enterprise system implementation efforts  as well as an increase in information systems spending to support the new initiatives and additional businesses  a million charge for costs to integrate the acquired levington business as discussed below  and increased legal and environmental charges of million  primarily for additions to the reserve for environmental matters 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  as a result of the levington and earthgro acquisitions during the year 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal were million  million of which is identified separately within operating expenses  million of which is included in cost of sales and million of which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these charges were primarily associated with three restructuring activities the consolidation of our two uk operations into one lower cost business  the closure of nine composting operations in the us that collect yard and compost waste for certain municipalities  and the sale or closure of certain other us plants or businesses 
the charge for consolidation of our uk operations was million and consisted of million to write off the remaining carrying value of certain property and equipment 
in connection with the integration of the miracle garden care and levington businesses  management elected to move certain production lines from a miracle garden care facility in howden to a levington facility in bramford 
as a result  certain production equipment at the howden facility will no longer be utilized 
in addition  certain computer hardware and software equipment previously used by the miracle garden care business would no longer be utilized as a result of electing to use acquired information systems of the levington business 
we ceased utilization of the production and computer equipment in the fourth quarter of the assets written off had nominal value and were scrapped or abandoned 
million to write off packaging materials rendered obsolete as a result of new packaging design and to provide for costs incurred in to relaunch products under a single branding strategy 
the charges associated with these actions were million and million  respectively 
million of severance costs associated with the termination of employees made redundant by the integration of the two uk businesses 
as of september   six employees had been terminated 
the remaining employees were terminated in fiscal all severance costs accrued at september  have been paid except for an adjustment of million for over accrual 
million write off of inventory rendered obsolete by the integration activities and million costs incurred in fiscal for other integration related costs 
the charge for closure of nine of our composting operations was million and consisted of million for costs to be incurred under contractual commitments for which no future revenues will be realized 
these costs are associated with the final processing of remaining compost materials  as required  through the end of the operating contract with the applicable municipality but after the time which revenue producing activities cease 
six of the composting sites have operating contracts that ended in fiscal for which million was accrued  the operating contracts for the three remaining sites will expire in fiscal for which million was accrued 
million to write down to estimated fair value certain machinery and equipment in accordance with sfas no 
for assets held for use 
depreciation continues to be recognized during the revenue producing periods 
fixed assets at facilities that have ceased operations have been abandoned or scrapped 
million to write off inventory which must be disposed of as a result of closing the various composting sites 
such inventory must be removed from the applicable sites and has only nominal value 
million for remaining lease obligations after revenue producing activities cease on certain machinery and equipment at the sites 
the composting facilities being closed as part of these restructuring initiatives incurred losses of approximately million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  which were included in our consolidated results of operations for those years 
the charge for sale or closure of certain other us plants or businesses was million and consisted of million to write down to estimated net realizable value the assets associated with our agrevo pesticides business acquired in fiscal we elected to divest these assets in order to avoid potential trade conflicts associated with our purchase of the ortho business and the signing of the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products 
the agrevo business incurred an operating loss of million in and million in before being sold in february million to write off and close a single growing media production facility that was deemed to be redundant after the purchase of the earthgro business in february the closure of the facility was completed in september other expenses for fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in charges provided for the disposal of assets and an increase in royalty income from licensing arrangements for some of our brand names  partially offset by increased foreign currency losses and legal and environmental provisions 
during fiscal  we recorded charges of million to write down certain long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
the components of these charges were as follows a charge of million to write down the carrying value of our peat harvesting facility in lafayette  new jersey 
operations at this facility were discontinued at the order of the philadelphia district of the us army corps of engineers in july while proceedings with the government are on going  we do not expect to resume operations at this site 
the charge reduced the carrying amount for this facility to its estimated fair value based on appraisal 
a charge of million to write off the carrying value of certain paper packaging equipment that was rendered obsolete by management s decision to convert to plastic packaging 
the equipment was considered to have only nominal value and has subsequently been abandoned or scrapped 
a charge of million to write down the carrying value of our water soluble fertilizer plant in allentown  pennsylvania 
in fiscal  management determined that the production capacity at this plant was unnecessary after completing the merger with miracle gro in fiscal the allentown facility was sold in july a charge of million to write off certain spreader molding equipment that was considered obsolete 
in fiscal  management elected to upgrade the production line at its spreader manufacturing facility in carlsbad  california 
in connection with this change  certain production equipment was unusable and was scrapped 
a charge of million to write off software costs that had been deferred under an enterprise wide applications systems implementation project 
in fiscal  management elected to change the software platform that would be used for this project 
costs that had been deferred while configuring and installing the previous software were determined to have no future benefit and were written off 
income from operations for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal excluding the restructuring and other charges of million discussed above  income from operations in fiscal was million  or of sales  which was just slightly below income from operations as a percentage of sales for fiscal of 
interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of over fiscal interest expense of million 
the increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings to fund the levington  earthgro and miracle garden acquisitions  partially offset by lower average debt levels excluding the acquisition borrowings 
income tax expense was million for fiscal  a decrease from income tax expense for fiscal our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of favorable tax planning strategies 
in february  we secured a new revolving credit facility to replace our then existing credit facility 
write off of deferred financing costs associated with the then existing credit facility resulted in an extraordinary loss  net of income taxes  on the early extinguishment of debt of million 
we reported net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis 
excluding the impact of the restructuring and other charges and extraordinary loss discussed above  we earned net income of per share on a diluted basis  a increase over fiscal this increase reflects the impact of strong sales volumes during fiscal as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided from operations for fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased working capital levels in fiscal and fiscal to support increased sales revenues 
the fiscal improvement compared to fiscal was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital management 
the seasonal nature of our sales results in a significant increase in working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventory during the first half of the fiscal year  with the third quarter being a significant cash collection period 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal and fiscal was due to the cost of businesses acquired during those years and increases in capital expenditures to install our new enterprise wide applications information system see discussion below and to upgrade some of our manufacturing facilities to more technologically advanced production capabilities 
our new credit facilities restrict annual capital investments to million 
financing activities generated cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and used cash of million in fiscal cash generated in fiscal was generally used to fund our acquisitions during fiscal  to repay our then existing credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and to fund increased working capital levels 
cash generated in fiscal was generally provided by our credit facilities in order to provide funds for the acquisitions during the year 
the lower level of debt repayment in fiscal reflects the usage of higher operating cash flows to support the additional investment in miracle garden and higher net capital investments 
total debt as of september  was million compared to million at september  the increase in debt year to year was primarily due to borrowings to fund the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions and higher working capital levels to support the growth of the business 
shareholders equity as of september  was million  a million increase compared to september  this increase was primarily attributable to net income of million  offset by convertible preferred stock dividends of million and net treasury stock purchases of million 
the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
on december   we and most of our subsidiaries entered into new credit facilities which provide for borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of billion and consist of term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
we funded the rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions with borrowings under the new credit facilities 
proceeds from the private debt offering of the senior subordinated notes and borrowings under the new credit facilities were used to fund the ortho acquisition and to repurchase our then outstanding senior subordinated notes 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal we estimate that capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal and and million to million for each of the next several years 
included in these estimates are amounts to be spent on our information systems initiative in fiscal and fiscal in july  our board of directors of authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions on or prior to september  as of september    common shares  or million  have been repurchased under the new repurchase program limit 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the new repurchase program will be at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions and our operating performance and liquidity 
any repurchase will also be subject to the covenants contained in our new credit facilities as well as our other debt instruments 
the repurchased shares will be held in treasury and will thereafter be used for the exercise of employee stock options and for other valid corporate purposes 
we anticipate that all repurchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  and that hagedorn partnership  lp will sell its pro rata share of such repurchased shares in the open market 
gains and losses on foreign currency transaction hedges are recognized in income and offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
gains and losses on foreign currency firm commitment hedges are deferred and included in the basis of the transactions underlying the commitments 
in our opinion  cash flows from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot ensure that our business groups will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all  or that future borrowings will be available under the new credit facilities in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness  including the new credit facilities  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
we are involved in several environmental related legal actions with various governmental agencies 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our future quarterly or annual operating results 
additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements and in this annual report on form k under item business environmental and regulatory considerations and item legal proceedings 
year readiness general we may be impacted by the inability of our computer software applications and other business systems eg  embedded microchips to properly identify the year due to a commonly used programming convention of using only two digits to identify a year 
unless modified or replaced  these systems could fail or create erroneous results when referencing the year management has assessed the extent and impact of this issue and has implemented a readiness program to mitigate the possibility of business interruption or other risks 
the readiness program includes all of our operations 
management believes that all significant business systems are compliant 
progress is being made on a limited number of open items  primarily relating to contingency planning  that will be completed before year end 
we have established a year program office to oversee the readiness program 
the program office functions include regular communication with year project managers and site visits to our various businesses to monitor remediation efforts and verify progress toward stated compliance goals 
the program office reports to senior management  who in turn reports regularly to scotts board of directors regarding our progress toward year readiness 
information technology systems currently  computer operations at our marysville  ohio north american headquarters support all us business groups with the exception of the republic tool spreaders manufacturing operations 
our foreign operations generally do not electronically interface with the us headquarters 
the north american headquarters mainframe operations consist primarily of internally developed systems that have been remediated 
other domestic and international operations utilize commercial packaged software which has been upgraded or replaced 
remediation of north american headquarters mainframe applications  which was our most complex and costly effort  was completed in april personal computers are being made year compliant by systematic upgrade through lease renewals and as part of the implementation of a company wide enterprise resource planning project 
many other hardware software upgrades have been executed under ongoing maintenance and support agreements with vendors 
testing of upgrades is being performed internally 
in support of our long range strategic plans  an enterprise wide application systems project is under way to link all business groups 
this enterprise wide system is being implemented in stages starting in july the primary software provider for the enterprise wide system has represented that its software is year compliant 
our year compliance efforts are concentrated on the currently existing systems to ensure there is adequate information systems support until implementation of the enterprise wide system is completed 
non information technology systems non information technology systems  consisting mainly of equipment and machinery operating and control systems  telecommunication systems  building air management systems  security and fire control systems  electrical and natural gas systems  have been assessed by each business group with advice from the suppliers of these systems services 
upgrades or replacements have been made as necessary 
third party suppliers we rely on third party suppliers for finished goods  raw materials  water  other utilities  transportation and a variety of other key services 
interruption of supplier operation due to year issues could affect our operations 
we continue to evaluate the status of suppliers efforts through confirmation and follow up procedures  including selected site assessments  to determine contingency planning where necessary 
state of readiness each business group has completed an internal inventory and assessment to identify information technology and non information technology systems that are susceptible to system failure or processing errors as a result of year issues 
the headquarters mainframe remediation project is complete  including testing 
the upgrade or replacement and testing of information technology systems at other north american operations is substantially complete 
non information technology efforts were performed concurrently and replacement and testing are substantially complete 
site visits have been conducted by the program office to verify year to date progress against plans 
year readiness plans are being executed within the international segment 
upgrades of packaged software for the primary systems are complete 
site visits have been conducted by the program office to verify year to date progress against plans 
a confirmation process with respect to third party suppliers continues 
additionally  site visits were conducted with critical suppliers as necessary  to determine whether alternative sources are needed 
costs we have been tracking incremental year costs which exclude the costs of internally dedicated resources 
the current estimate of incremental costs for the year efforts excluding those related to the enterprise wide resource planning project is approximately million 
of this amount  million has been incurred through september  these costs  with the exception of relatively small capital expenditures  are being expensed as incurred and are being funded through operating cash flows or from borrowings under our credit facility 
a summary of the cost components follows in millions fiscal fiscal location total actual estimate headquarters mainframe other u

operations international operations total risks our principal business risks relating to completion of year efforts are reliance on key business partners to not have disruption in their ability to provide goods and services as a result of year issues 
unforeseen issues arising in connection with recent and future acquisitions business partnerships 
forecasting unreliability due to customers departures from expected buying patterns 
the ability to continue to focus on year issues by internal and external resources 
because our year readiness is dependent upon key business partners also being year ready  there can be no guarantee that our efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the possible consequences to us of our key business partners inability to provide goods and services as a result of year issue include temporary plant closings  delays in delivery of finished products  delays in receipt of key raw materials  containers and packaging supplies  invoice and collection errors  and inventory and supply obsolescence 
we believe that our readiness efforts with critical partners  which include confirmation  site visits and contingency planning  should reduce the likelihood of such disruptions 
we cannot identify all possible worst case scenarios  however  the most reasonable worst case scenario would be the failure of utilities and or transportation systems that are critical to our operations and that could not quickly be replaced by other suppliers or through internal resources 
in these situations  operations at the affected facility or facilities would be interrupted with adverse effects on our financial results 
we are developing contingency plans  however  these plans do not contemplate extended disruptions by third party suppliers of products or services to scotts 
contingency plans a formal contingency planning process continues 
we will continue to assess where alternative courses of action are needed as the information technology and non information technology readiness plans are executed 
plans are in place to alleviate internal issues and minimize customer impact of the most likely and critical potential risks 
due to the nature of contingency planning  assessment and planning efforts will continue through the end of ongoing process our readiness program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various components of the program described above are subject to change 
enterprise resource planning in july  we announced a project designed to bring our information system resources in line with our current strategic objectives 
the project will include the redesign of many key business processes in connection with the installation of new software on a world wide basis over the course of the next several fiscal years 
we anticipate that the north american businesses will be operating under the new information systems by the end of fiscal our international businesses should be operational within the next two years thereafter 
we estimate that the project will cost million  approximately of which will be capitalized over a period of four to eight years 
sap has been selected as the primary software provider for this project 
euro a new currency called the euro has been introduced in certain economic and monetary union countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
we are still assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
we expect to take appropriate actions based on the results of this assessment 
we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
management s outlook fiscal was a very significant year for scotts  as we reported record sales of billion  achieved market share growth in every one of our major u 
s 
categories  and established a number one market share position in most of the significant lawn and garden categories across the world 
the strategic acquisitions during fiscal  most notably the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses  were critical in providing us with dominant market positions in the pesticides category as well as continental european lawn and garden markets 
the year s performance reflected the successful continuation of our primary growth drivers to emphasize consumer oriented marketing efforts to pull demand through its distribution channels  and to make strategic acquisitions to increase market share in global markets and within segments of the lawn and garden category 
looking forward to fiscal  the timing of the ortho acquisition in fiscal must be considered 
because the ortho business was acquired in january  fiscal earnings did not reflect the loss that is traditionally incurred by the ortho business during the october through december period  as well as the amortization of goodwill and interest charges associated with the acquisition 
management estimates that this one time benefit was approximately cents per share  which  when subtracted from fiscal reported earnings per share  more accurately reflects scotts current year performance 
looking forward  we maintain the following broad tenets to our strategic plan promote and capitalize on the strengths of the scotts r  miracle gro r  hyponex r and ortho r industry leading brands  as well as our portfolio of powerful brands in our international markets 
this involves a commitment to investors and retail partners that we will support these brands through advertising and promotion unequaled in the lawn and garden consumables market 
in the professional categories  it signifies a commitment to customers to provide value as an integral element in their long term success  commit to continuously study and improve knowledge of the market  the consumer and the competition  simplify product lines and business processes  to focus on those that deliver value  evaluate marginal ones and eliminate those that lack future prospects  and achieve world leadership in operations  leveraging technology and know how to deliver outstanding customer service and quality 
as part of our ongoing strategic plans  management has established challenging  but realistic  financial goals  including sales growth of to in core businesses  an aggregate operating margin improvement of at least over the next four years  and minimum compounded annual earnings per share growth of to forward looking statements we have has made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual report  form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
the forward looking statements that we make in our annual report  in this form k and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are set forth below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements 
adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results 
weather conditions in north america and europe have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales  while periods of dry  hot weather can decrease pesticide sales 
in addition  an abnormally cold spring throughout north america and or europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticides sales and therefore our financial results 
our historical seasonality could impair our ability to make interest payments on indebtedness 
because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer  our business is highly seasonal 
for the past two fiscal years  approximately to of our sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
our working capital needs and our borrowings peak near the end of our first fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand is insufficient to cover interest payments due on our indebtedness at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facilities  this seasonality could adversely affect our ability to make interest payments as required by our indebtedness 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk 
public perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us 
we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products  such as fertilizers  herbicides and pesticides  bearing one of our brands 
on occasion  customers allege that some of these products fail to perform up to expectations or cause damage or injury to individuals or property 
public perception that our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair our reputation  damage our brand names and materially adversely affect our business 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flow available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we fail to comply with any of the financial or other restrictive covenants of our indebtedness  our indebtedness could become due and payable in full prior to its stated due date 
we cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash  which we may not be able to generate 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all 
we also cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we might not be able to integrate our recent acquisitions into our business operations successfully 
we have made several substantial acquisitions in the past four years 
the acquisition of the ortho business represents the largest acquisition we have ever made 
the success of any completed acquisition depends  and the success of the ortho acquisition will depend  on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business 
we believe that our recent acquisitions provide us with significant cost saving opportunities 
however  if we are not able to successfully integrate ortho  rhone poulenc jardin or our other acquired businesses  we will not be able to maximize such cost saving opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate these acquired businesses  because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors  could materially adversely affect our financial results 
because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers  the loss of one or more of our top customers could adversely affect our financial results 
our top north american retail customers together accounted for approximately of our fiscal sales and of our outstanding accounts receivable as of september  our top three customers  home depot  wal mart and kmart represented approximately  and of our fiscal sales 
these customers hold significant positions in the retail lawn and garden market 
the loss of  or reduction in orders from  home depot  wal mart  kmart or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products  we would lose a substantial source of future earnings 
if we were to commit a serious default under the marketing agreement with monsanto for consumer roundup r products  monsanto may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement rightfully  we would not be entitled to any termination fee  and we would lose all  or a significant portion  of the significant source of earnings we believe the marketing agreement provides 
monsanto may also terminate the marketing agreement within a given region  including north america  without paying us a termination fee if sales to consumers in that region decline over a cumulative three year fiscal year period  or by more than for each of two consecutive fiscal years 
monsanto may not terminate the marketing agreement  however  if we can demonstrate that the sales decline was caused by a severe decline of general economic conditions or a severe decline in the lawn and garden market in the region rather than by our failure to perform our duties under the agreement 
the expiration of patents relating to roundup r and the scotts turf builder r line of products could substantially increase our competition in the united states 
glyphosate  the active ingredient in roundup r  is covered by a patent in the united states that expires in september sales in the united states may decline as a result of increased competition after the us patent expires 
any decline in sales would adversely affect our net commission under the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products and  therefore  our financial results 
a sales decline could also trigger monsanto s regional termination right under the marketing agreement 
our methylene urea product composition patent  which covers scotts turf builder r  scotts turf builder r with plus tm with weed control and scotts turf builder r with halts r crabgrass preventer  is due to expire in july and could also result in increased competition 
any decline in sales of turf builder r products after the expiration of the methylene urea product composition patent could adversely affect our financial results 
the interests of the former miracle gro shareholders could conflict with those of our other shareholders 
the former shareholders of stern s miracle gro products  inc  through hagedorn partnership  lp  beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common shares of scotts on a fully diluted basis 
the former miracle gro shareholders have sufficient voting power to significantly control the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
the interests of the former miracle gro shareholders could conflict with those of our other shareholders 
compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
all products containing pesticides must be registered with the united states environmental protection agency and  in many cases  similar state and or foreign agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on us 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals 
we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides  which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us environmental protection agency is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in our products  which are also used on foods  will be evaluated by the us environmental protection agency as part of this non dietary exposure risk assessment 
it is possible that the us environmental protection agency may decide that a pesticide we use in our products  would be limited or made unavailable 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the us environmental protection agency s evaluation 
we believe that we should be able to obtain substitute ingredients if selected pesticides are limited or made unavailable  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so for all products 
regulations regarding the use of some pesticide and fertilizer products may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that the products be used only in specified locations 
users may be required to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied and may be required to notify individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future 
the use of some ingredients has been banned 
even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  we cannot assure that our products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
the harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny 
in the united states  state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to its intended use 
in some locations we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
in the united kingdom  our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation 
since  we have been involved in litigation with the philadelphia district of the us army corps of engineers involving our peat harvesting operations at hyponex s lafayette  new jersey facility 
the corps of engineers is seeking a permanent injunction against harvesting and civil penalties in an unspecified amount 
in addition to the regulations already described  local  state  federal  and foreign agencies regulate the disposal  handling and storage of waste  air and water discharges from our facilities 
in june  the ohio environmental protection agency gave us formal notice of an enforcement action concerning our old  decommissioned wastewater treatment plants that had once operated at our marysville facility 
the ohio epa action alleges surface water violations relating to possible historical sediment contamination  inadequate treatment capabilities at our existing and currently permitted wastewater treatment plants and the need for corrective action under the resource conservation recovery act 
we are continuing to meet with the ohio epa and the ohio attorney general s office to negotiate an amicable resolution of these issues 
we are currently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
during fiscal  we made approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses  compared with approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses in fiscal management anticipates that environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses for fiscal will not differ significantly from those incurred in fiscal if we are required to significantly increase our actual environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses  it could adversely affect our financial results 
our failure  or the failure of our suppliers or customers  to address information technology issues related to the year could adversely affect our operations 
like other business entities  we must address the inability of our computer software applications and other business systems to properly identify the year due to a commonly used programming convention of using only two digits to identify a year 
unless modified or replaced  these systems could fail or create erroneous results when referencing the year we rely on third party suppliers for finished goods  raw materials  water  other utilities  transportation and a variety of other key services 
if one or more of our suppliers fail to address the year problem adequately  their operations could be interrupted 
this interruption  in turn  could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the failure of our retailer customers adequately to address the year problem could adversely affect our financial results 
the implementation of the euro currency in some european countries between and could adversely affect us 
in january  the euro was introduced in some economic and monetary union countries and by  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
additionally  the european commission has not yet defined and finalized all of the rules and regulations with regard to the euro currency 
we are still assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
we expect to take appropriate actions based on the results of our assessment 
however  we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a materially adverse effect on us or our operating results and financial condition 
our significant international operations make us more susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to the costs of international regulation 
we currently operate manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america  particularly in the united kingdom  germany and france 
our international operations have increased with the acquisitions of levington  miracle garden  ortho and rhone poulenc jardin and with the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products 
in fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  additional costs of compliance with local regulations  and historically  higher rates of inflation than in the united states 
the costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate our market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have various debt instruments outstanding at september  that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments  we have entered into the following interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates a million british pounds sterling notional amount swap to convert variable rate debt obligations denominated in british pounds sterling to a fixed rate 
the exchange rate used to convert british pounds sterling to us dollars at september  was pound sterling 
four interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million which are used to hedge certain variable rate obligations under our credit facility 
the credit facility requires that we enter into hedge agreements to the extent necessary to provide that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due and term loan facilities is subject to a fixed rate 
the following table summarizes information about our derivative financial instruments and debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  for debt instruments  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at september  the information is presented in us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swap on gbp libor average rate interest rate swaps on usd libor average rate other market risks our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
through fiscal  we had only minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in foreign currencies 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals and paper and plastic products 
our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply and to minimize costs 
we seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors 
we do not enter into forward contracts or other market instruments as a means of achieving our objectives or minimizing our risk exposures on these materials
