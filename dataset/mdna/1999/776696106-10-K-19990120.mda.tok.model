item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations general the following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated 
amounts are dollars in thousands and percentages are of net sales 
year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings year ended october  industrial controls net sales    gross profit    operating profit    fluid handling net sales    gross profit    operating profit    analytical instrumentation net sales    gross profit    operating profit    includes results of petrotech from june  and pmc beta from may  operating profit excludes unallocated corporate administrative costs 
such costs were   and  for the years ended october   and  respectively 
includes results of fluid metering from may  and flow technology from december  includes results of gatan from june   princeton from may   ids from november   acton from march  and photometrics from april  year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal of million represented the sixth consecutive year that the company has established a record high 
the company s core sales excludes sales to gazprom increased for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  total industrial controls sales increased due mostly to the full year results from the may acquisition of petrotech and increased sales to gazprom 
sales to gazprom were million for the year ended october  as gazprom entered into a financing agreement to stabilize this business 
this compared to million in sales during fiscal fluid handling sales increased because of the december acquisition of flow technology which more than offset sales declines related to this segment s oil gas  power generation and semiconductor capital equipment markets 
analytical instrumentation sales increased largely because of the full year or partial year results of four recent acquisitions 
changes in overall gross profit derived mainly from the impact of the recently acquired companies and increased sales to gazprom 
the gross profit percentage for the industrial controls segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was adversely affected by petrotech  which was acquired in may and historically experiences lower returns than the segment s other units 
excluding petrotech  industrial controls gross profit percentage would have been compared to for fiscal most of the other decline stemmed from lower margins at compressor controls as a result of lower margins on gazprom business from increased engineering and procurement services in fiscal the decline in fluid handling s gross profit percentage was not significant despite some difficult market conditions affecting several of this segment s units that more than offset strong results from flow technology 
the gross profit percentage for analytical instrumentation decreased primarily because of results of acton  photometrics and princeton  which reported combined gross profit of 
photometrics and princeton were merged into a single company named roper scientific 
analytical instrumentation s gross profit was also adversely affected by about on an inventory write down at roper scientific that was identified upon implementation of better business systems 
petrotech had the greatest effect causing the decrease in roper s overall gross profit percentages in compared to other large factors were the lower margins at compressor controls and the inventory write down at roper scientific 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   primarily because of the expenses associated with the recent acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase resulted largely from additional reserves recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to a further deterioration of economic conditions in russia and the region that cast doubt on the collectibility of certain accounts receivable related to sales in interest expense increased million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  principally because of higher debt levels resulting from the acquisition of seven companies since the beginning of fiscal interest rates were slightly lower in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because of more favorable terms negotiated into the nationsbank agreement in may libor rates became lower late in fiscal  but the effects on fiscal results were not significant 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal there were also no significant differences between years in the reconciling items between the statutory rate and the effective rate for these years 
sales order bookings were million during the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october   an increase of 
on a pro forma basis  to include acquisitions for similar periods in the prior year  bookings were higher this year compared to last year 
industrial controls bookings were up on a pro forma basis because of petrotech  which booked a large project  and compressor controls  because of increased business with gazprom following gazprom establishing new financing arrangements early in the year 
fluid handling s bookings were up down on a pro forma basis compared to fiscal the acquisition of flow technology offset lower bookings at integrated designs caused by the depressed business conditions in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
bookings within analytical instrumentation increased down on a pro forma basis 
whereas the increase resulted from acquisitions  the pro forma decrease reflected weak business conditions for all of the companies in this segment 
sales order backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  on a pro forma basis  backlog was lower than last year 
pro forma backlog at industrial controls was down despite a significant increase at petrotech that resulted from increased bookings discussed above 
backlog related to russia region shipments was down million compared to last year  largely because of delayed shipments at october  that were shipped during the first quarter of fiscal excluding the russia region decrease in backlog  actual and pro forma backlog at industrial controls was up and at october  compared to october   respectively 
fluid handling s pro forma backlog was lower at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal largely because of an decline in the backlog at integrated designs 
pro forma backlog was lower at analytical instrumentation due to the lower level of bookings 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for of million represented the fifth consecutive year that the company established a record high 
sales were million in the increased sales during derived mostly from the inclusion of the results of gatan and fluid metering for the entire year each of these companies was acquired during may and combined  contributed million of additional revenues and the inclusion of princeton and petrotech for part of each of these companies was acquired during may and combined  contributed million of sales in 
excluding these four companies  net sales for were approximately the same as metrix and uson each had very strong sales growth in in excess of primarily because of increased volume 
integrated designs reported decreased sales of about because of continued adverse conditions affecting the cyclical semiconductor equipment industry 
integrated design s sales during fiscal continued to significantly trail the level reported during the first two quarters of isl reported sales about lower in compared to the largest reason for isl s decreased sales was the strengthened us dollar during relative to the french franc about  the functional currency for most of isl s sales 
another factor contributing to isl s lower sales was its restructuring  which resulted in the disposal of small sales subsidiaries in the uk and brazil 
compressor controls also reported lower sales about in compared to compressor controls had significant sales to its primary customers in the cis  gazprom and ukraine gazprom  during million that exceeded comparable sales million 
both of these customers were unable to finalize their respective financing programs to make purchases at similar levels in net sales for the industrial controls segment up million  or increased mostly because of the inclusion of petrotech for the last five months of the increased sales at metrix was largely offset by a sales decline at compressor controls  where gains in the core business were more than offset by declines in the cis business  as noted above 
net sales for the fluid handling segment up million  or increased mostly because of the inclusion of fluid metering for all of compared to only five months in the decrease in integrated designs sales was partially offset by higher sales at roper pump 
net sales for the analytical instrumentation segment up million  or increased mostly because of the inclusion of gatan for all of compared to the last five months of and the inclusion of princeton since its acquisition in may the increased sales reported by uson were largely offset by decreased sales by isl 
the increase in gross profit in million in compared to million in is also due mostly to gatan  fluid metering  princeton and petrotech  which were acquired over the past two years 
excluding these companies  gross profit increased million in even though sales were relatively flat 
gross profit increased in each of the operating companies except for integrated designs and isl  whose decreases were directly related to decreased sales 
despite the drop in sales  compressor controls gross profit improved on a favorable product mix and certain cost reduction efforts 
industrial controls gross profit increased up million  or mostly because of the inclusion of petrotech million for the last five months of gross profit also increased at compressor controls million as discussed previously 
fluid handling gross profit increased up million  or largely as a result of including fluid metering for a full year compared to only part of analytical instrumentation gross profit increased up million  or because of the inclusion of gatan for all of compared to only part of million and the inclusion of princeton for the latter part of million 
the overall gross profit percentage in equaled that of  despite the increased profitability mentioned earlier 
this was attributable to the acquisition of petrotech  whose typical gross profit percentage is significantly less than that of the company s other operating units 
excluding petrotech  the company would have reported consolidated gross profit of  or an increase of compared to this increase was mainly from the product mix and cost improvements at compressor controls  whose gross margin percentage was up almost compared to and the high margins on increased sales at gatan full year vs 
partial year 
excluding petrotech  industrial controls would have reported gross profit of compared to in because of the improvements at compressor controls 
gross profit percentages in for the fluid handling and analytical instrumentation segments were each within about of the amounts reported in other than compressor controls  the gross profit percentages reported by each of the company s operating units were considered relatively comparable between and within 
sg a expenses increased million  or  during compared to most of the increase million stemmed from the additional costs associated with those companies acquired during the past two years 
compressor controls also reported additional costs of million  largely the result of efforts over the past eighteen months to increase the infrastructure supporting the anticipated increased business with gazprom and other opportunities in the area 
sg a expenses for industrial controls increased up million  or mainly because of the additional costs reported at compressor controls and the inclusion of petrotech million 
sg a expenses for fluid handling increased up million  or mostly because of the full year vs 
partial effects of fluid metering million 
sg a expenses for analytical instrumentation increased up million  or as a result of the full year vs 
partial year effects of gatan million and the inclusion of princeton in million 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased costs at isl attributable to the benefits of the restructuring program executed early in and exchange rate fluctuations 
as a percentage of sales  consolidated sg a expenses was in compared to in most of the increase was derived from higher research and development r d spending million in  of sales  compared to million in  of sales associated with the higher technology products at gatan and princeton 
these two companies accounted for million of the increase 
other r d spending increases reflected a continuing commitment to new product development at all companies 
selling expenses and administrative expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales less than as a result of volume leverage and cost containment programs 
interest expense increased million during compared to because of the full year effect of the additional borrowings used to finance most of the acquisition costs of gatan and fluid metering each acquired in may and the partial year effect of the acquisitions of princeton and petrotech 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in results from greater utilization of foreign sales corporation fsc benefits on export sales 
the recently acquired gatan  princeton and petrotech all had significant export sales 
net earnings were million  or per common share diluted  in compared to million  or per common share diluted  in all per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on august  bookings during million increased compared to million  mainly because of the impact of the companies acquired over the past two years million 
excluding these companies  bookings during increased compared to  reflecting strength in the industrial controls segment up  mostly at amot and metrix 
fluid handling and analytical instrumentation each reported slightly lower bookings in for those companies included in all of both and no individual company changed more than 
on a pro forma basis including gatan and fluid metering bookings since november  and princeton and petrotech bookings since the date in comparable to their acquisition date in  bookings were up in compared to sales order backlog was million and million at october  and  respectively 
most of the increase million represented the backlog at princeton and petrotech  which were acquired during on a pro forma basis to include these companies backlog at october   the backlog was greater than financial condition  liquidity and capital resources october  compared to october  working capital was reduced to million at october  compared to million at october  decreased working capital combined with increased sales was representative of the company s efforts to maximize cash flow opportunities 
the company utilizes a million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks to provide most of its external financing requirements 
total debt was million at october  compared to million at october  the debt to total capitalization ratio increased to at october  from at october  since october   the company s cash costs for acquisitions have been million for ids  million for flow technology  million for acton  million for photometrics and million for pmc beta 
the acquisition of acton also included the issuance of roper common stock with an assigned value of million 
the assets and liabilities of these companies at their respective acquisition dates also accounted for many of the changes in the company s financial condition components between october  and october  as illustrated in the following table in thousands acquired other companies activity accounts receivable     inventories     other current assets     property and equipment    intangible assets     other noncurrent assets     accounts payable     accrued liabilities     income taxes payable  other noncurrent liabilities   the decrease in accounts receivable was mostly due to a reduction of approximately million in net receivables from compressor controls customers in its cis eastern europe region 
this reduction was mostly due to additional reserves recorded in the fourth quarter in response to deteriorated economic conditions in russia as discussed previously 
other large reductions in accounts receivable stemmed from a decline in fourth quarter sales at integrated designs and a reduction in accounts receivable balances at petrotech as a result of improved collection procedures 
the decrease in inventories was also mostly at compressor controls where there was a buildup of inventory at october  in anticipation of sales to gazprom that did not occur until the first quarter of fiscal petrotech s inventories were higher at october  than last year by million because of progress on a large project and roper scientific s inventories excluding the acquisition of photometrics were down due to an adjustment that is the subject of an ongoing investigation possibly involving improper activities  and because of other improvements in operating practices 
the decrease in intangible assets was from the periodic amortization of goodwill 
during fiscal  gazprom put in place a long term financing for its purchase of turbomachinery controls sourced from the company s compressor controls unit 
this financing has facilitated a more consistent supply of product to gazprom 
this financing arrangement is expected to be available over the next several years for additional turbomachinery controls purchases 
however  given unstable political and economic conditions in russia  the company s future shipments to gazprom will continue to be subject to these political  economic and other uncertainties  which could adversely affect the timing and amount of future shipments and cannot be assured 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to of the company s outstanding common stock over a twelve month period 
these purchases can be either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
prior to october   the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock about of total outstanding shares for million 
authorization still exists to complete the stock buy back program 
however  future purchases will be dependent upon market conditions and other factors deemed relevant and cannot be assured 
the company s capital expenditures requirements are modest for an industrial products company and were million for the year ended october  the company does not believe there will be a change in the order of magnitude of capital expenditure requirements in fiscal the management team of one of the company s smallest indirect subsidiaries holds a minority interest in that company under an existing agreement whereby the minority interest will be purchased by its parent based on a multiple of operating income in fiscal this subsidiary will then become indirectly wholly owned by the company 
this transaction is to occur early in fy and is estimated to be about million 
in november  the company s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on its outstanding common stock from per share to per share 
this represents the sixth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased 
the company believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining unused credit under its nationsbank agreement will be adequate to finance additional authorized common stock purchases  normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although the company maintains an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on the company s activities  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that the newly acquired companies as well as the existing companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which the company generally has experienced 
however  the rate at which the company can reduce its debt during fiscal and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions  additional purchases of the company s outstanding common stock under the buy back program and the financial performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty 
the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas reporting comprehensive income  sfas disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits and sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities that will be applicable to the company in fiscal or fiscal once adopted  none of these standards is expected to affect its financial position  operating results or disclosures significantly 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these specific new pronouncements 
year issues many data processing applications identify a year using its last two digits and assume the first two digits are after december  when the first two digits of a year become  there is uncertainty regarding how these applications will interpret the current date and the inability to interpret the date correctly might disrupt the effectiveness of the data processing applications 
such disruptions might disrupt normal business operations 
these issues are commonly known as yk issues 
the company believes it has taken reasonable steps to instigate a process that should ensure that its operations are not going to be materially affected by yk issues that affect the functionality of its products or processes 
the company has identified some products and processes that need to be modified and such changes are planned to be implemented well in advance of january  in general  the company has very few products that are date sensitive and most of these products do not rely on the date for their performance 
some of the company s subsidiaries are or had been using data information systems that would not properly address yk issues 
some of the changes necessary to address these issues have already been made and remaining changes are planned to be implemented before january  total prior and future costs  including capital expenditures  are expected to be less than million  most of which has already been incurred 
the company does not utilize any material interdependent computer systems  either between its subsidiaries or between the company and its suppliers or customers 
the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario with yk issues involves a disruption at a direct vendor or one of the vendor s vendors that reduces the availability of components to the company s products 
no individual product accounts for a significant amount of the company s revenues and the company believes it could find alternative sources for such components that might become unavailable from historical sources 
each of the company s subsidiaries has been undergoing a process of contacting their vendors to assess their preparedness for yk issues 
it s also possible that yk issues affecting the company s customers could cause them to delay or cancel their orders for the company s products 
the company is continuing to assess potential material disruption from yk issues that might disrupt our customers businesses 
due to the diversity of the company s customer base  the company does not believe that any disruption of its business by a single customer due to its problems with yk issues would materially affect its business as a whole 
the company cautions that it s not possible to know the full impacts of what might happen when the events triggering yk issues actually occur and the impact on the company could be significantly worse than the worst case scenario the company believes reasonably likely to occur 
market risks at october   the company s interest rate swap agreements represented a potential liability of million  or about of net assets 
for every interest rate movement of basis points higher or lower at october   the value attributed to the swap agreements would have been lower or higher by about  upon adoption of sfas  the value attributed to the swap agreements will be reflected in the financial position of the company and changes in this valuation will mostly be reflected as a component of other comprehensive income 
the swap agreements are intended to reduce the volatility of interest payments related to its long term borrowings 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s fiscal sales denominated in a currency other than us dollars mostly western europe and japan were less than of total sales and net assets maintained in a functional currency other than us dollars mostly france and the uk at october  were less than of total net assets 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has not historically been significant to the company s operations or net assets 
outlook with the unusually high level of shipments made to gazprom in the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects first quarter earnings in fiscal to be less than that reported for the first quarter of fiscal for the entire year  the company expects fiscal to be its seventh consecutive year of record sales and earnings 
however  several of the markets for the company s products and services oil gas  power generation and semiconductor capital equipment are currently experiencing a softness in demand and the impact on results for fiscal is uncertain 
the company expects to continue an active acquisition program 
however  completion of future acquisitions and their impact on the company s results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted 
forward looking information the information provided elsewhere in this annual report  in other company filings with the securities and exchange commission  and in other press releases and public disclosures contains forward looking statements about the company s businesses and prospects as to which there are numerous risks and uncertainties which generally are beyond the company s control 
some of these risks include the level and timing of future business with gazprom and other eastern european customers  changes in interest rates  yk effects and the future operating results of the newly acquired companies 
there is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on the company s future operations  financial condition  or financial results
