year compliance the following year discussion is provided in response to the securities and exchange commission s recent interpretative statement expressing its view that public companies should include detailed discussion of year issues in their md a 
the company has completed an organized program assessing the issues confronting it related to the year problem  which is the result of the inability of many computer systems and electronic equipment to distinguish the year from the year the program was designed to assure the company s information technology systems and related infrastructure will be year compliant 
the company divided its year issues into three areas including computer hardware and software business systems  manufacturing processing control devices and related systems  and facility support systems 
the company s year program included three phases an audit and assessment phase designed to identify year issues  a modification phase designed to correct year issues this phase included testing of individual modifications as they were installed  and a testing phase to test entire systems for year compliance after individual modifications were installed and tested 
all phases of the company s year program are substantially complete 
the estimated cost for correction of year issues  including any software and hardware changes and the cost of personnel involved in working on the project  is approximately  substantially all of which has been incurred to date 
the year updates were funded out of funds generated from operations and account for less than of the company s information technology budget 
the company s year program also included investigation of the year readiness status of our major vendors and customers 
the company used letters  questionnaires and protocols to determine its vendors and customers readiness 
the company has contacted all major vendors including energy and scrap suppliers and external service providers including banks  insurance companies and phone service providers to determine their year compliance status 
the company has also contacted significant customers to determine their progress towards year compliance and to identify issues  if any  which might develop if a customer is unable to become year compliant on a timely basis 
based upon the responses received  all of our major vendors and customers indicated they are addressing the year issues on a timely basis 
the company has developed a year contingency plan in the event we experience year related problems 
the plan includes  among other actions  reverting to manual systems and controls and setting internal clocks to earlier dates 
the company believes that with the modifications made to its computer systems and electronic equipment  the year issue will not result in significant operational problems 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with addressing the year problem for both internal and external systems critical to the company s operations  there is a risk of a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
while the company is not aware of any significant exposure  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material impact on the company s business and operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices while the company has not experienced any material long term adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  margins have been affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are steel scrap  labor  and energy  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
scrap costs are frequently influenced by supply and demand factors as well as general economic conditions 
finished product prices are influenced by nationwide economic trends and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price increases  the effect of steel imports  market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to increase prices 
see business employees  competition and other market factors  raw materials and manufacturing operation 
forward looking statements the matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this report on form k that are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the reliance on truck and utility vehicle industry  excess industry capacity  product demand and industry pricing  volatility of raw material costs  especially steel scrap  intense foreign and domestic competition  management s estimates of niche market data  the cyclical and capital intensive nature of the industry  and cost of compliance with environmental regulations 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from those projected or implied by such forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  various statements in the previous discussion of year are likewise forward looking statements 
these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to the inability of the company to complete the plans and modifications that it has identified  the failure of software vendors to deliver the upgrades and repairs to which they have committed  the wide variety of information technology systems and components  both hardware and software  that must be evaluated  and the large number of vendors and customers with which the company interacts 
the company s assessments of the effects of year on the company are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and the company s reasonable reliance on that information 
therefore  the risk that inaccurate information is supplied by third parties upon which the company reasonably relied must be considered as a risk factor that might affect the company s year efforts 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests
