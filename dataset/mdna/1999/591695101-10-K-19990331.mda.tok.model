the operating loss for the year ended december  decreased million to million 
the decrease in operating loss is principally attributable to non cash employee compensation and costs of million in the non cash expenses were partially offset by personnel costs of million 
the company launched two new joint ventures  chongqing tai le feng telecommunications co  ltd 
and ningbo ya lian telecommunications co  ltd  each of which necessitated recruitment of additional support staff 
the wireline telephone network project supported by the company s sichuan tai li feng joint venture began actual network construction in early joint planning of expansion to the ningbo city gsm network was undertaken with the company s chinese partners in the first half of these latter measures necessitated recruitment of additional engineering staff to support the activities 
finally  the company undertook an aggressive effort in early to secure additional projects in china  including due diligence and discussion of draft documentation of joint venture contracts with several potential partners 
this resulted in legal and research expenses of million  considerably in excess of those experienced in in addition  depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  in from the prior year 
equity in losses of joint ventures 
equity in losses of the communications group s joint ventures in china amounted to million in as compared to  in the majority of the losses arise from the absence of any joint venture revenues during the pre operational state of the projects each venture supports 
the joint ventures in the pre operational stage contributed million of the losses 
the company s wireline telephone network joint venture in sichuan province and the chongqing municipality remained in a pre operational state as of december  but network construction activity preliminary to the commercial service launch in january was aggressive throughout the year 
the company s only operational venture in china during  supporting the ningbo city gsm network  recorded income of  the ningbo city project generated million in revenues to the joint venture 
minority interests 
for the years ended december  and  minority interests represents the allocation of losses to metromedia china corporation s minority ownership 
inflation and foreign currency certain of the communications group s subsidiaries and joint ventures operate in countries where the rate of inflation is extremely high relative to that in the united states 
while the communications group s subsidiaries and joint ventures attempt to increase their subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs  there is no assurance that they will be able to do so 
therefore  operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue  resulting in a material negative impact on operating results 
the company itself is generally negatively impacted by inflationary increases in salaries  wages  benefits and other administrative costs  the effects of which to date have not been material to the company 
in  a number of emerging market economies suffered significant economic and financial difficulties 
adverse economic conditions in the russian federation resulted in a national liquidity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued crisis  devaluation of the rouble  higher interest rates and reduced opportunity for refinancing or refunding of maturing debts 
although the russian federation government announced policies intended to address the structural weakness in the russian economy and financial sector  it is unclear if such policies will improve the economic situation 
the financial crisis and the government s planned response may result in reduced economic activity  a reduction in the availability of credit and the ability to service debt  further increases in interest rates  an increased rate of inflation or hyperinflation  further devaluation of the rouble  restrictions on convertibility of the rouble and movements of hard currency  an increase in the number of bankruptcies of entities  including bank failures  labor unrest and strikes 
if the economic and financial situation in the russian federation and other emerging markets does not improve  the reduced level of economic activity and the opportunity to obtain financing in these markets could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the communications group 
if such factors should materialize the company expects such factors would affect its cable television  paging and radio broadcasting businesses in russia and belarus and certain other markets 
in addition  the georgian lari experienced significant devaluation from september to march this devaluation could negatively impact the conversion to us dollars of cash flows generated in certain telephony and cable television joint ventures 
the communications group s strategy is to minimize its foreign currency risk 
to the extent possible  the communications group bills and collects all revenues in us dollars or an equivalent local currency amount adjusted on a monthly basis for exchange rate fluctuations 
the communications group s subsidiaries and joint ventures are generally permitted to maintain us dollar accounts to service their us dollar denominated debt and current account obligations  thereby reducing foreign currency risk 
as the communications group s subsidiaries and joint ventures expand their operations and become more dependent on local currency based transactions  the communications group expects that its foreign currency exposure will increase 
the communications group does not hedge against foreign exchange rate risks at the current time and therefore could be subject in the future to any declines in exchange rates between the time a subsidiary or a joint venture receives its funds in local currencies and the time it distributes such funds in us dollars to the communications group

liquidity and capital resources the company mmg is a holding company and  accordingly  does not generate cash flows from operations 
the communications group is dependent on mmg for significant capital infusions to fund its operations and make acquisitions  as well as to fulfill its commitments to make capital contributions and loans to its joint ventures 
such funding requirements are based on the anticipated funding needs of its joint ventures and certain acquisitions committed to by the company 
future capital requirements of the communications group  including future acquisitions  will depend on available funding from the company and on the ability of the communications group s joint ventures to generate positive cash flows 
snapper is restricted under covenants contained in its credit agreement from making dividend payments or advances  other than certain permitted debt repayments  to the company and the company has periodically funded the short term working capital needs of snapper 
the company  at its discretion  can make dividend payments on its cumulative convertible preferred stock preferred stock in either cash or common stock 
if the company were to elect to continue to pay the dividend in cash  the annual cash requirement would be million 
during  the company paid its four quarterly dividends of the preferred stock in cash 
since each of the communications group s joint ventures operates or invests in businesses  such as cable television  fixed telephony and cellular telecommunications  that are capital intensive and require significant capital investment in order to construct and develop operational systems and market its services  the company will require in addition to its cash on hand  additional financing in order to satisfy its long term business objectives including its on going working capital requirements  and acquisition and expansion requirements 
such additional capital may be provided through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities of the company or by separate equity or debt financings by the communications group or certain companies of the communications group 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate additional funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly its long term business objectives and the company s results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that its cash on hand will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements for the remainder of management believes that its long term liquidity needs will be satisfied through a combination of the company s successful implementation and execution of its growth strategy to become a global communications and media company and the communications group s joint ventures achieving positive operating results and cash flows through revenue and subscriber growth and control of operating expenses 
as the communications group is in the early stages of development  the company expects to generate significant consolidated net losses for the foreseeable future as the communications group continues to build out and market its services 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued communications group the communications group has invested significantly in cash or equipment through capital contributions  loans and management assistance and training in its joint ventures 
the communications group has also incurred significant expenses in identifying  negotiating and pursuing new telecommunications opportunities in selected emerging markets 
the communications group and many of its joint ventures are experiencing continuing losses and negative operating cash flow since many of the businesses are in the development and start up phase of operations 
for  the communications group s primary source of funds was from the company in the form of inter company loans 
until the communications group s operations generate positive cash flow  the communications group will require significant capital to fund its operations  and to make capital contributions and loans to its joint ventures 
the communications group relies on the company to provide the financing for these activities 
the company believes that as more of the communications group s joint ventures commence operations and reduce their dependence on the communications group for funding  the communications group will be able to finance its own operations and commitments from its operating cash flow and will be able to attract its own financing from third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional capital in the form of debt or equity will be available to the communications group at all or on terms and conditions that are acceptable to the communications group or the company  and as a result  the communications group will continue to depend upon the company for its financing needs 
credit agreements between the joint ventures and the communications group are intended to provide such ventures with sufficient funds for operations and equipment purchases 
the credit agreements generally provide for interest to accrue at rates ranging from the prime rate to the prime rate plus and for payment of principal and interest from of the joint venture s available cash flow  as defined  prior to any distributions of dividends to the communications group or its joint venture partners 
the credit agreements also often provide the communications group the right to appoint the general director of the joint venture and the right to approve the annual business plan of the joint venture 
advances under the credit agreements are made to the joint ventures in the form of cash for working capital purposes  as direct payment of expenses or expenditures  or in the form of equipment  at the cost of the equipment plus cost of shipping 
as of december   the communications group was committed to provide funding under the various charter fund agreements and credit lines in an aggregate amount of approximately million  of which million remained unfunded 
the communications group s funding commitments under a credit agreement are contingent upon its approval of the joint venture s business plan 
to the extent that the communications group does not approve a joint venture s business plan  the communications group is not required to provide funds to the joint venture under the credit line 
the communications group s consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures ability to generate positive operating results is dependent upon their ability to attract subscribers to their systems  the sale of commercial advertising time and their ability to control operating expenses 
management s current plans with respect to the joint ventures are to increase subscriber and advertiser bases and thereby operating revenues by developing a broader band of programming packages for cable television and radio broadcasting and by offering additional services and options for telephony services 
by offering the large local populations of the countries in which the joint ventures operate desired services at item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued attractive prices  management believes that the joint ventures can increase their subscriber and advertiser bases and generate positive operating cash flow  reducing their dependence on the communications group for funding of working capital 
additionally  advances in the price performance of telephony technology are expected to reduce capital requirements per subscriber 
further initiatives to develop and establish profitable operations include reducing operating costs as a percentage of revenue and assisting joint ventures in developing management information systems and automated customer care and service systems 
no assurances can be given that such initiatives will be successful or if successful  will result in such reductions 
additionally  if the joint ventures do become profitable and generate sufficient cash flows in the future  there can be no assurance that the joint ventures will pay dividends or will return capital at any time 
eastern europe and the republics of the former soviet union the fixed telephony  cellular  international and long distance telephony and cable television businesses in the aggregate are capital intensive 
the communications group generally provides the primary source of funding for its joint ventures both for working capital and capital expenditures  with the exception of its gsm joint ventures

commercial services commenced on the completed portions of the phase gsm network in november the phase network was fully completed and in service in february the communications group s china joint ventures ability to generate positive operating results is heavily dependent on the ability of china unicom to successfully construct commercially viable networks and attract customers to these networks 
chinese regulations currently prohibit the joint ventures from taking a direct role in either construction or operation 
management seeks to minimize the construction and operations risks facing those china unicom entities with which the joint ventures have contracted through a program of active technical and management consulting 
experts within the joint ventures and the company s other china offices work directly with the chinese operators to enhance the operators technical  marketing and operational plans 
training of the chinese operators personnel is also provided in both classroom and on the job formats 
joint venture personnel also assist item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the chinese operators with general project management and vendor contract administration 
these measures are all permitted under the chinese regulations and are supported by explicit provisions of the joint ventures cooperation contracts 
at present  management s primary focus is on growing the number of customers in each market and on solidifying china unicom s operational readiness to serve each market 
each joint venture works to distinguish china unicom s network and operation on the basis of technical and service quality 
management views these parameters as offering the chinese operator better opportunity for long term success in the china market than could be achieved solely through price and cost competition 
as a result  the joint ventures encourage moderate additional investment in quality factors on the part of the chinese operators 
no assurance can be given that management s measures or the efforts of the chinese operators will be successful 
additionally  if the joint ventures do become profitable  there can be no assurance that the joint ventures will pay dividends or return the capital invested by the company 
risks associated with the communications group s investments the ability of the communications group and its joint ventures to establish profitable operations is subject to significant political  economic and social risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets such as eastern europe  the fsu and china 
these include matters arising out of government policies  economic conditions  imposition of or changes in government regulations and policies  imposition of or changes to taxes or other similar charges by governmental bodies  exchange rate fluctuations and controls  civil disturbances  deprivation or unenforceablility of contractual rights  and taking of property without fair compensation 
in  a number of emerging market economies suffered significant economic and financial difficulties 
adverse economic conditions in the russian federation resulted in a national liquidity crisis  devaluation of the rouble  higher interest rates and reduced opportunity for refinancing or refunding of maturing debts 
although the russian federation government announced policies intended to address the structural weakness in the russian economy and financial sector  it is unclear if such policies will improve the economic situation 
the financial crisis and the government s planned response may result in reduced economic activity  a reduction in the availability of credit and the ability to service debt  further increases in interest rates  an increased rate of inflation or hyperinflation  further devaluation of the rouble  restrictions on convertibility of the rouble and movements of hard currency  an increase in the number of bankruptcies of entities  including bank failures  labor unrest and strikes 
if the economic and financial situation in russian federation and other emerging markets does not improve  the reduced level of economic activity and the opportunity to obtain financing in these markets could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the communications group 
the company expects such factors to affect its cable television  paging and radio broadcasting businesses in russia and belarus and certain other markets 
the communications group s strategy is to minimize its foreign currency risk 
to the extent possible  in countries that have experienced high rates of inflation  the communications group bills and collects all revenues in us dollars or an equivalent local currency amount adjusted on a monthly basis for exchange rate fluctuations 
the communications group s joint ventures are generally permitted to maintain u 
s 
dollar accounts to serve their us dollar obligations  thereby reducing foreign currency risk 
as the communications group and its joint ventures expand their operations and become more item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dependent on local currency based transactions  the communications group expects that its foreign currency exposure will increase 
the communications group does not hedge against foreign exchange rate risks at the current time and  therefore  could be subject in the future to any declines in exchange rates between the time a joint venture receives its funds in local currencies and the time it distributes such funds in us dollars to the communications group 
the communications group may also be materially and adversely affected by laws restricting foreign investment in the field of communications 
certain countries  including china  have extensive restrictions on foreign investment in the communications field and the communications group attempts to structure its prospective projects in order to comply with such laws 
however  there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory restrictions will not increase in the future or  as currently promulgated  will not be interpreted in a manner giving rise to tighter restrictions  and thus may have a material adverse effect on the communications group s existing and prospective projects in the country 
the russian federation has periodically proposed legislation that would limit the ownership percentage that foreign companies can have in radio and television businesses and more recently has proposed legislation that would limit the number of radio and television businesses that any company could own in a single market 
while such proposed legislation has not been enacted  it is possible that such legislation could be enacted in russia and that other countries in eastern europe and the republics of the former soviet union may enact similar legislation which could have a material adverse effect on the business operations  financial condition or prospects of the communications group 
the proposed foreign investment legislation could be similar to united states federal law which limits foreign ownership in entities owning broadcasting licenses 
there is no way of predicting whether additional ownership limitations will be enacted in any of the communications group s markets  or whether any such law  if enacted  will force the communications group to reduce or restructure its ownership interest in any of the ventures in which the communications group currently has an ownership interest 
if additional ownership limitations are enacted in any of the communications group s markets and the communications group is required to reduce or restructure its ownership interests in any ventures  it is unclear how such reduction or restructuring would be implemented  or what impact such reduction or restructuring would have on the communications group 
current chinese law and regulation prohibit foreign companies and joint ventures in which they participate from providing telehony services to customers in china and generally limit the role that foreign companies or their joint ventures may play in the telecommunications industry 
as a result the communications group s investments in joint ventures in china have been made through a structure known as the ssf joint venture  a widely used method for foreign investment in the chinese telecommunications industry  in which the ssf venturer is a provider of telephony equipment  financing and technical services to telecommunications operators and not a direct provider of telephone service 
since mid  there has been uncertainty regarding possible significant changes in the regulation of and policy concerning foreign participation in and financing of the telecommunications industry in china  including the continued viability of the ssf structure and associated service and consulting arrangements with china unicom 
there has been no official policy statement or new regulations as yet announced  and the company has not received any official notice regarding new policy or regulation 
the communications group is not now holding discussions regarding new projects in the chinese telephony sector 
the company believes that no such discussions can be productive until more definitive information is available 
in light of the current regulatory uncertainty  the company is unable to estimate the impact such changes in policy or regulation  if any  would have on the communications group s chinese joint ventures abilities to generate significant revenue  cash flow or net income 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the foregoing factors relating to economic and financial conditions in the russian federation and other emerging markets  and to chinese law and regulation relating to foreign investment in the telecommunications industry  have not had an effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations as of and for the year ended december  as is noted above  the company cannot yet predict the impact that such factors may have on its financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company reports the results of the operations of the communications group s operations in eastern europe and the republics of the former soviet union and the distributable cash flow generated by the telephony networks of china unicom on a three month lag and therefore the impact of such factors  if any  are not yet fully reflected in the company s results of operations 
snapper on november   snapper entered into a loan and security agreement with the lenders named therein and fleet capital corporation  as agent and as the initial lender  pursuant to which the lenders have agreed to provide snapper with a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility the snapper loan  the proceeds of which were used to refinance snapper s then outstanding obligations under its prior revolving credit agreement and will also be used for working capital purposes 
the snapper loan will mature in november subject to automatic one year renewals  and is guaranteed by the company up to million increasing to million on the occurrence of specified events 
interest on the snapper loan is payable at snapper s option at a rate equal to prime plus up to or libor plus between and  in each case depending on snapper s leverage ratio under the snapper loan agreement 
the agreements governing the snapper loan contain standard representation and warranties  covenants  conditions precedent and events of default  and provide for the grant of a security interest in substantially all of snapper s assets other than real property 
at december   snapper was in compliance with all financial covenants required under the loan and security agreement 
at june   snapper was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its prior revolving credit agreement

snapper has entered into various long term manufacturing and purchase agreements with certain vendors for the purchase of manufactured products and raw materials 
as of december   noncancellable commitments under these agreements amounted to approximately million 
snapper has an agreement with a financial institution which makes available floor plan financing to dealers of snapper products 
this agreement provides financing for dealer inventories and accelerates snapper s cash flow 
under the terms of the agreement  a default in payment by a dealer is nonrecourse to snapper 
however  snapper is obligated to repurchase any new and unused equipment recovered from the dealer 
at december   there was approximately million outstanding under this floor plan financing arrangement 
the company has guaranteed snapper s payment obligations under this agreement 
the company believes that snapper s available cash on hand  the cash flow generated by operating activities  borrowings from the snapper loan and security agreement and  on an as needed basis  short term working capital funding from the company  will provide sufficient funds for snapper to meet its obligations and capital requirements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mmg consolidated year ended december  compared to year ended december  cash flows from operating activities cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million  a decrease in cash used in operations of million from the prior year 
losses from operating activities include significant non cash items such as discontinued operations  depreciation  amortization  equity in losses of investees  nonrecurring charge of the communications group s writeoff of goodwill and other intangibles and fixed assets  early extinguishment of debt  gain on sale of assets  and losses allocable to minority interests 
excluding discontinued operations and extraordinary items  non cash items decreased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease relates principally to equity losses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions  increased cash flows for the year ended december  by million and decreased cash flows by million  for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows for the year ended december  resulted from the company s decision to significantly decrease its production of inventory at snapper in the current year partially offset by increased losses in the communications group s operations due to the start up nature of these operations and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses to support the increase in the number of joint ventures 
cash flows from investing activities cash provided from investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the principal sources of funds from investing activities in were proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million and the net proceeds of million from the sale of landmark and proceeds of million from the sale of protocall ventures

financing activities in includes the net proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock 
of the million of payments of debt  million relates to the payment on the company s debentures 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  cash flows from operating activities cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million  an increase in cash used in operations of million from the prior year

changes in assets and liabilities  net of the effect of acquisitions  decreased cash flows for and by million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows in resulted from the increased losses in the communications group s operations due to the start up nature of these operations and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses to support the increase in the number of joint ventures and the inclusion of snapper s operating losses in the increase in operating assets principally reflects increases in inventory of snapper s products 
cash flows from investing activities cash provided by investing activities in was million as compared to cash used in investing activities of million in the prior year

year system modifications the company is currently working to evaluate and resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information and network systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures resulting from recognition of a date using as the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year rather than the year the company expects to make some of the necessary modifications through its ongoing investment in system upgrades 
the company has delegated responsibility to a group of executives to coordinate the identification  evaluation and implementation of changes to computer systems and applications necessary to achieve the company s goal of a year date conversion which would minimize the impact on the company s subsidiaries  joint ventures and their subscribers and customers  and avoid disruption to business operations 
the company is also focusing on outside forces that may affect the company s operations  including the company s and its subsidiaries and joint ventures vendors  banks and utility companies 
the company s analysis of the year problem is on going and will be continuously updated through the remainder of as necessary 
the company has developed a year project plan for the company  its subsidiaries and unconsolidated joint ventures 
however  the company is not directly responsible for year readiness of many of its joint ventures and in some cases has no access to the joint venture s management regarding these matters 
executives of the company are responsible for monitoring year activities across all subsidiaries and joint ventures 
individual joint ventures and subsidiaries are responsible for initiating and executing specific year action plans 
the company has completed its inventory of information technology it and non it systems 
joint venture it and non it systems have principally been reviewed on a line of business basis for cable television  telephony  radio and paging ventures 
the mission critical systems identified for the company s joint ventures are those that relate to revenue generation  customer service and collection and billing 
non it mission critical systems include gsm switches  acs tocom systems  satellite program delivery systems and paging terminals and related equipment 
the company has initiated communications with all of its suppliers and its joint ventures suppliers of mission critical systems 
the company has accepted the service providers statement of year compliance as evidence in its assessment phase 
for those mission critical systems determined not to be compliant  the company is in the process of replacing or remediating the system at each significant joint venture or subsidiary 
in addition  limited testing has been performed at certain joint ventures and at the subsidiaries and joint venturers technical facilities 
the company recognizes that to the extent its remediation efforts and those of its joint ventures fail to prevent year problems from arising  a temporary interruption of service and loss of revenue may occur 
high level contingency plans have been developed which include the removal of noncompliant technology from service on a temporary basis  replacing systems  or reverting to manual processes to deal with such possible occurrences 
the company expects to complete this project prior to january  based on the preliminary data  the company s estimate is that the year effort will cost approximately  to million  covering the period from january  through december   out of a total expected cost of information systems of million for this period  although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate cost of the year effort or the total cost of information systems 
such costs will be expensed as incurred  except to the extent such costs are incurred for the purchase or lease of capital equipment 
as of december   the company has incurred  in respect of its year conversion effort  or to of the total estimated cost 
the company expects that the source of funds for year costs will be cash on hand 
no other information systems projects of the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures have been deferred due to the year efforts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s communications group is heavily dependent on third parties  many of whom are themselves heavily dependent on technology 
in some cases  the company s third party dependence is on vendors of technology who are themselves working toward solutions to year problems 
moreover  the company is dependent on the continued functioning of basic  heavily computerized services such as banking and telephony 
further  the company s communications group s businesses are located in countries where basic services are operated by the government or other governmental entities and the company may not be able to obtain information on year problems 
in certain joint ventures of the communications group  the company does not have a controlling management interest and cannot unilaterally cause the joint venture to commit the necessary resources to solve any year problems 
however  substantially all of the company s joint ventures operate or are planned to operate in countries where reliance on automated systems is substantially less significant  and more recent  than in the united states 
therefore  the company believes that  in the event year problems arise in such joint ventures  the local operators of such joint ventures and customers and vendors should be able to revert to manual methods 
if the company  its joint ventures in which it does not have a controlling management interest  and their respective customers and vendors are unable to solve any year issues  a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition could result 
the above information is based on the company s current estimates using numerous assumptions of future events 
given the complexity of the year issues and possible unidentified risks  actual results may vary from those anticipated and discussed above 
new accounting disclosures accounting for derivatives in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued 
sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the gain or loss due to changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas can not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial position of the company is routinely subjected to a variety of risks 
in addition to the market risk associated with interest rate movements on outstanding debt and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  other examples of risk include collectibility of accounts receivable and significant political  economic and social risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets such as eastern europe  the fsu and china 
with the exception of snapper  the company did not have any significant long term obligations at december  since snapper s bank debt is a floating rate instrument  its carrying value approximates its fair value 
a basis point increase in the level of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in interest expense of  in addition  a item a

in the majority of the countries that the communications group s joint ventures operate  there currently do not exist derivative instruments to allow the communications group to hedge foreign currency risk 
in addition  at the current time the majority of the communications group s joint ventures are in the early stages of development and the company does not expect in the near term to repatriate significant funds from the communications group s joint ventures
