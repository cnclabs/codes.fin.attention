item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we derive our revenue from 
our core business of providing local  long distance and related communications services to end users  typically in a bundled package 
the sale of advertising space in telephone directories 
traditional local telephone company services in east central illinois and southeast south dakota 
special access  private line and data services 
communications network maintenance services and telephone equipment sales  leasing  service and installation 
telemarketing services 
other communications services  including video  computer networking  cellular  operator  payphone  mobile radio and paging services we began providing traditional local telephone company services and other communications services as a result of our acquisition of cci in september  telephone directory advertising as a result of our acquisition of telecomusa publishing in september  and telemarketing services as a result of our acquisition of ruffalo cody in july the table set forth below summarizes our percentage of revenues from these sources year ended december  local and long distance communications services telephone directory advertising traditional local telephone company services special access  private line and data services network maintenance and equipment services telemarketing services other communications services we began offering local and long distance services to business customers in january at the end of  we began offering  on a test basis  long distance services to residential customers 
in june  we began marketing and providing to residential customers in cedar rapids  iowa and iowa city  iowa an integrated package of communications services  marketed under the name primeline r  that includes local and long distance service  voice mail  internet access and travel card services 
since june  we have expanded the states in which we offer service to business customers to include iowa  illinois  indiana  minnesota  wisconsin  north dakota  south dakota  colorado  missouri and wyoming 
we also expanded our primeline r service to additional cities in iowa and illinois and began offering the service to customers in north dakota  south dakota  wisconsin  wyoming and colorado 
we plan to continue our efforts to market and provide local  long distance and other communications services to business customers and market our primeline r service to residential customers 
our principal operating expenses consist of cost of service  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of service primarily includes local services purchased from regional bell operating companies  costs to terminate the long distance calls of our customers through long distance carriers  costs of printing and distributing telephone directories and costs associated with maintaining the iowa communications network 
the iowa communications network is a fiber optic communications network that links many of the state of iowa s schools  libraries and other public buildings 
sg a consists of sales and marketing  customer service and administrative expenses  including the costs associated with operating our communications network 
depreciation and amortization include depreciation of our telecommunications network and equipment  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions  amortization expense related to the excess of estimated fair market value in aggregate of options over the aggregate exercise price of such options granted to some of our officers  other employees and directors  and amortization of one time installation costs associated with transferring customers local line service from the regional bell operating companies to our local telecommunications service 
as we expand into new markets  both cost of service and sg a will increase 
we expect to incur cost of service and sg a expenses before achieving significant revenues in new markets 
fixed costs related to leasing of central office facilities needed to provide telephone services must be incurred prior to generating revenue in new markets  while significant levels of marketing activity may be necessary in the new markets in order for us to build a customer base large enough to generate sufficient revenue to offset such fixed costs and marketing expenses 
in january and february  we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  and  shares of our class a common stock  respectively  at an exercise price of per share  to some of our directors  officers and other employees 
the estimated fair market value of these options  in the aggregate  at the date of grant was later determined to exceed the aggregate exercise price by approximately million 
additionally  in september  we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price of to some employees of cci 
the fair market value of these options  in the aggregate  at the date of grant exceeded the aggregate exercise price by approximately million 
these amounts are being amortized on a monthly basis over the four year vesting period of the options 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception as a result of efforts to build our customer base  develop and construct our communications network infrastructure  build our internal staffing  develop our systems and expand into new markets 
we expect to continue to focus on increasing our customer base and geographic coverage and bringing our customer base onto our communications network 
accordingly  we expect that our cost of service  sg a and capital expenditures will continue to increase significantly  all of which may have a negative impact on operating results 
in addition  our projected increases in capital expenditures will continue to generate negative cash flows from construction activities during the next several years while we install and expand our fiber optic communications network and develop wireless services 
we may also be forced to change our pricing policies to respond to a changing competitive environment  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our operating margin 
we cannot assure you that growth in our revenue or customer base will continue or that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows 
we have generated net operating losses since our inception and  accordingly  have incurred no income tax expense 
we have reduced the net deferred tax assets generated by these losses by a valuation allowance which offsets the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the tax loss carry forwards 
we will reduce the valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized

the senior discount notes  senior notes  senior notes  senior notes and senior notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of mcleodusa and our subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the senior discount notes  senior notes  senior notes  senior notes and senior notes also are effectively subordinated to all existing and future third party indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the indentures governing our senior discount notes  senior notes  senior notes  senior notes and senior notes impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
these restrictions affect  and in many cases significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to 
incur additional indebtedness

redeem capital stock 
make other restricted payments 
enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
create liens upon assets 
enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons 
sell assets 
consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets we cannot assure you that such covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that may be in our interests 
we need significant capital to continue to expand our operations  facilities  network and services 
we cannot assure you that our capital resources will permit us to fund our planned network deployment and operations or achieve operating profitability 
failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to delay or abandon some of our expansion plans or expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   based on our business plan  capital requirements and growth projections as of that date  we estimated that we would require approximately billion through our estimated aggregate capital requirements include the projected costs of 
building our fiber optic communications network  including intra city fiber optic communications networks 
expanding operations in existing and new markets 
developing wireless services 
funding general corporate expenses 
completing recent and pending acquisitions 
constructing  acquiring  developing or improving telecommunications assets the estimated costs and incremental capital needs associated with the acquisitions of talking directories  info america  dakota telecommunications and ovation are included in our estimated aggregate capital requirements 
we expect to use the following to address our capital needs 
approximately million in net proceeds from our offering of senior notes 
approximately million of cash and investments on hand at december  
additional issuances of debt or equity securities 
projected operating cash flow our estimate of future capital requirements is a forward looking statement within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ substantially from our estimate due to factors such as 
strategic acquisition costs and effects of acquisitions on our business plan  capital requirements and growth projections 
unforeseen delays 
cost overruns 
engineering design changes 
changes in demand for our services 
regulatory  technological or competitive developments 
new opportunities we also expect to evaluate potential acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances on an ongoing basis 
we may require additional financing if we pursue any of these opportunities 
accordingly  we may need additional capital to continue to expand our markets  operations  facilities  network and services 
we may meet any additional capital needs by issuing additional debt or equity securities or borrowing funds from one or more lenders 
we cannot assure you that we will have timely access to additional financing sources on acceptable terms 
we have received a non binding commitment from the chase manhattan bank to lead a syndication to provide a senior secured revolving credit facility 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in obtaining such credit facility on acceptable terms or at all 
failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to delay or abandon some of our expansion plans or expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business risk factors failure to raise necessary capital could restrict our ability to develop our network and services and engage in strategic acquisitions 
market risk at december   we recorded the marketable equity securities that we hold at a fair value of million 
these securities have exposure to price risk 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in quoted market prices would amount to a decrease in the recorded value of investments of approximately million 
we believe our exposure to market price fluctuations on all other investments is nominal due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations  as substantially all of our long term debt obligations are fixed rate obligations 
year date conversion we are currently verifying system readiness for the processing of date sensitive information by our computerized information systems 
the year problem impacts computer programs and hardware timers using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some of our programs and timers that have time sensitive functions may recognize a date using as the year rather than  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
we are reviewing our it and non it computer systems and programs to determine which are not capable of recognizing the year and to verify system readiness for the millennium date 
the review covers all of our operations and is centrally managed 
the review includes increasing employee awareness and communication of year issues inventorying hardware  software and data interfaces and confirming year readiness of key vendors identifying mission critical components for internal systems  vendor relations and other third parties estimating costs for remediation estimating completion dates testing and verifying systems remediating any identified problems by correcting or replacing systems or components implementing the remediation plan developing contingency plans training for contingency plans we have completed more than of the activities required for the first three of these steps  more than of the activities required for the fourth and fifth steps  more than of the activities required for the sixth and seventh steps and more than of the activities required for the eighth step 
we are in the initial stages of performing the activities required to complete the remaining steps and have begun to develop contingency plans to handle our most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios 
the completion percentages do not include information for pending or recently completed acquisitions 
the review and related year activities have not caused us to defer or forego  to any material degree  any other critical it project 
we estimate that our year readiness costs will not exceed million 
we generally expense these costs as incurred 
as of february   we had incurred costs of million in connection with our year readiness activities 
our estimate of our year readiness costs is a forward looking statement within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of costs  results  performance and effects of year activities described in those forward looking statements may differ materially from actual costs  results  performance and effects in the future due to the interrelationship and interdependence of our computer systems and those of our vendors  material service providers  customers and other third parties 
we have not yet fully identified our most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios 
we continue to contact our vendors  suppliers and third parties with which we have material relationships  regarding their state of readiness 
this activity is focused primarily on mission critical systems and key business suppliers 
u s west  ameritech and southwestern bell are our primary suppliers of local central office switching and local lines 
until we have received and analyzed substantial responses from them we will have difficulty determining our worst case scenarios 
we have begun to develop contingency plans to handle worst case scenarios  to the extent they can be identified fully 
we intend to complete our contingency planning after completing our determination of worst case scenarios 
completion of these activities depends upon the responses to the inquiries we have made of our major vendors  material service providers and third parties with which we have material relationships 
we have also begun work on contingency plans for some systems identified as critical to our operations 
if we  our major vendors  our material service providers or our customers fail to address year issues in a timely manner  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on local exchange carriers  primarily the regional bell operating companies  to provide most of our local and some of our long distance services 
to the extent u s west  ameritech or southwestern bell fail to address year issues which might interfere with their ability to fulfill their obligations to us  such interference could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
if other telecommunications carriers are unable to resolve year issues  it is likely that we will be affected to a similar degree as others in the telecommunications industry 
effects of new accounting standards in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and is required to be adopted no later than our fiscal year 
we plan to modify our method of capitalization of such costs by adopting this statement prospectively on january  we are currently evaluating this statement but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement sfas as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance that is  fiscal quarters beginning june  and thereafter 
sfas cannot be applied retroactively 
sfas must be applied to a derivative instruments and b derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired or substantively modified after december  and  at the company s election  before january  
we do not expect the impact of the adoption of sfas to be material to our results of operations as we do not currently hold any derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we recorded the marketable equity securities that we hold at a fair value of million 
these securities have exposure to price risk 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in quoted market prices would amount to a decrease in the recorded value of investments of approximately million 
we believe our exposure to market price fluctuations on all other investments is nominal due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations  as substantially all of our long term debt obligations are fixed rate obligations
