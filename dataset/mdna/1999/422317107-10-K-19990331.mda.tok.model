these statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates which are inherently subject to uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of the company  and reflect future business decisions which are subject to change 
some of the assumptions may not materialize and unanticipated events may occur which can affect the company s results 
year readiness disclosure state of readiness the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its information assets it assets and non it assets with embedded microprocessors will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has implemented a comprehensive plan the plan including the following phases i the identification of mission critical operating systems and applications and the inventory of all hardware and software at risk of being date sensitive to year related problems collectively  year problems  ii assessment and evaluation of these systems including prioritization  iii modification  upgrading and replacement of the affected systems  and  iv compliance testing of the systems 
the plan s goal is either to certify systems as year compliant or to determine and fund the correction of the affected systems 
to achieve this goal  the company has established year teams that are responsible for analyzing the year impact on operations and for formulating appropriate strategies to overcome and resolve the year problems 
to date  significant progress on each of the four phases of the plan has been made 
the status of the plan s completion is as follows i the company has identified all mission critical operating systems 
as of march   approximately of the inventory phase of the plan has been completed and the company expects to complete this phase by early april ii as of march   the company has completed approximately of the assessment and evaluation phase of the systems inventoried 
the company expects to complete this phase of the plan by the end of april this phase includes inquiring formally into the year readiness of the company s third party vendors  suppliers and service providers to determine the impact of the year on the technology they have supplied and their plans to address any potential year problems 
the company has received responses from approximately of the companies identified 
iii as of march   the company has completed approximately of the phase which entails modification  upgrade and replacement of affected systems 
the company continues to identify systems that require remediation and replacement and will schedule the repair or replacement of non compliant systems as they are identified 
completion of this phase which entails modification  upgrade and replacement to affected systems is expected to occur by the end of the third quarter in iv as of march   the company has completed approximately of the compliance testing for systems modified  upgraded or replaced 
the compliance testing phase of the plan is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter in year costs the majority of costs associated with the company s year problems have been and are expected to be for fully depreciated and obsolete systems that were scheduled for replacement prior to the year these replacement systems were installed to provide users with enhanced capabilities and functionality  not solely to bring systems into year compliance 
the company has spent approximately million on these replacement systems 
through december   the company has spent approximately million for systems with accelerated replacement schedules due to year problems and approximately million for remediation of equipment and systems with year problems 
the company expects to spend approximately million for scheduled replacement systems  approximately million for systems with accelerated replacement schedules due to year problems and approximately million for remediation of equipment and systems with year problems 
this estimate assumes that third party suppliers have accurately assessed the compliance of their products and that they will successfully correct the issue in non compliant products 
because of the complexity of correcting year problems  actual costs may vary from these estimates 
contingency plans the company is developing year contingency plans 
these contingency plans include specific instructions to enable stations to continue operations should mission critical systems become inoperable as a result of year problems 
the framework of the contingency plans have been circulated to all stations and are being modified by each station to reflect internal procedures 
various simulated exercises will be conducted to verify the contingency plan s effectiveness 
the contingency plans include performing certain processes  as well as developing alternative procedures should third party services be unavailable 
the company believes that due to the pervasive nature of potential year problems  the contingency planning process is an ongoing one that will require further modification as the company obtains additional information regarding i the company s internal systems and equipment during the remediation and testing phases of its year program and ii the status of third party year readiness 
acquisitions the company has inquired into the year readiness of the pulitzer and kelly broadcasting stations see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
an assessment has been made of the pulitzer broadcasting company and kelly broadcasting systems  and systems potentially affected by year problems have been identified 
included are systems which were fully depreciated  obsolete and scheduled for replacement 
the company expects to spend approximately million for systems whose replacement schedule was accelerated and approximately million for remediation of equipment and systems with year problems 
however  because of the complexity of correcting year problems  actual costs may vary from this estimate 
the company is prepared to fund remediation projects for the pulitzer broadcasting company and kelly broadcasting stations 
the evaluation of all systems and third party dependencies is ongoing 
possible consequences of year problems the company believes that completed and planned modifications and conversions of its internal systems and equipment will allow it to be year compliant in a timely manner 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s internal systems or equipment or those of third parties on which the company relies will be year compliant or that the company s or third parties contingency plans will mitigate the effect of any noncompliance 
the failure of the systems or equipment of the company or third parties which the company believes is the most reasonable likely worst case scenario could effect the broadcast of advertisements and programming and could have a material effect on the company s business or consolidated financial statements
