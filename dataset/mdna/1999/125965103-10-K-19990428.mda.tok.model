item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
part i item business general we are the largest retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest retailers of such products in the united states based  in each case  on our number of stores 
as of january   we operated stores as one fully integrated company under three brand names checker auto parts  founded in and operating in the southwestern and rocky mountain states  schuck s auto supply  founded in and operating in the pacific northwest  and kragen auto parts  founded in and operating primarily in california 
we offer a broad selection of national brand name and private label automotive products for domestic and imported cars  vans and light trucks 
our products include new and remanufactured automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories 
most of our sales are to do it yourself customers  although our commercial sales program focusing on sales to auto repair professionals and fleet owners represents a significant and increasing part of our business 
our stores typically offer between  and  stock keeping units  or skus 
our operating strategy is to offer our products at everyday low prices and at conveniently located and attractively designed stores  supported by highly trained  efficient and courteous customer service personnel 
we do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs 
automotive aftermarket industry we are a retailer of aftermarket automotive products such as replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories 
the term aftermarket distinguishes our sales from those items sold as part of the original sale of a car or truck 
we believe that the automotive aftermarket for these items is growing because of increases in the size and age of the country s automotive fleet  the number of miles driven annually per vehicle  the purchase prices of new cars  the cost of replacement parts  and labor costs associated with parts  installation and maintenance 
there are many companies selling automotive aftermarket products 
we believe  however  that the industry is consolidating as national and regional specialty retail chains gain market share at the expense of smaller independent retailers and less specialized mass merchandisers 
automotive specialty retailing chains like ours  which have multiple locations in a given market area  enjoy competitive advantages in purchasing  distribution  advertising and marketing compared to most small independent retailers 
in addition  the recent significant increase in the variety of domestic and imported vehicle makes and models has increased the number of automotive replacement parts 
this makes it difficult for smaller independent retailers and less specialized mass merchandise chains to maintain inventory selection broad enough to meet customer demands 
we believe this has created a competitive advantage for us and for other automotive specialty retailing chains that have the distribution capacity and sophisticated information systems to stock and deliver a large number of products in a timely manner 
marketing and merchandising strategy our marketing and merchandising strategy is to build market share by providing a broad selection of national brand name and private label products at everyday low prices 
we offer these products at conveniently located and attractively designed stores  staffed by highly trained  efficient and courteous employees 
customer service we are a customer oriented retailer dedicated primarily to do it yourself consumers with a significant and increasing focus on commercial customers 
we try to enhance customer service by use of our sophisticated product distribution and store support systems  as well as our extensive training programs 
we believe that the recruiting  training and retention of high quality sales associates is required if our business is to be successful 
we operate training and incentive programs to encourage the development of technical expertise by our sales associates so they can effectively advise customers on product selection and use 
csk university  our sales associate development program  is dedicated to the continuous education of store associates through structured on the job training and formal classroom instruction 
the curriculum focuses on four areas of the associate s development customer service skills  basic automotive systems  advanced automotive systems  and management development 
much of the training is delivered through formal classes in training centers that are fully equipped with the same systems as are in our stores 
we believe that our training programs enable sales associates to provide a high level of service to a wide variety of customers ranging from less informed do it yourself consumers to more sophisticated purchasers requiring diagnostic advice 
we also provide continuing training programs for store managers and district managers designed to assist them in increasing store level efficiency and improving their potential for promotion 
in addition  we require periodic meetings of district and store managers to facilitate and enhance communications within our organization 
approximately  of our associates have passed the ase p test  a nationally recognized certification for auto parts technicians 
in order to satisfy our customers  we adopted several service initiatives including free testing of starters  alternators and batteries  free charging of batteries  installation assistance for batteries  windshield wipers and other selected products  no hassle return policies  and electronically maintained lifetime warranties  which eliminate the need for consumer record keeping 
our significant investments in associate training and store level information systems enable our in store personnel to devote more time to attending to our customers automotive needs 
we use our centralized database as a source to make approximately  calls annually to customers inquiring as to their overall satisfaction with our sales associates  pricing  product selection and quality 
in addition  the results of customer satisfaction surveys are provided to each store and the appropriate management personnel to ensure that customer service levels remain a store focus 
product selection our stores have a broad selection of national brand name products in order to generate customer traffic and appeal to our commercial customers 
in addition  we stock a large selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value conscious customers 
each store offers an extensive product line  including automotive replacement parts such as starters  alternators  shock absorbers  mufflers  brakes  spark plugs  filters and batteries  as well as a wide variety of maintenance items  such as motor oil  lubricants  waxes  cleaners  polishes and antifreeze 
in addition  each store offers general accessories such as car stereos  alarms  trim  floor mats  tools and seat covers 
sales of replacement parts account for approximately of our sales 
replacement parts typically generate higher gross profit margins than maintenance items or general accessories 
we are increasing our sales of replacement parts  as a percentage of total sales  by offering a wider selection of replacement parts and by increasing sales to commercial customers 
product availability our stores offer between  and  skus of national brand name and private label automotive products 
if a store does not carry a specific part  store associates are able to use our surround store inventory program to record the sale  reserve the part and direct the customer to pick it up from a store in the same market or at one of our nearby depots 
we have continued to expand and improve our delivery system and have increased our number of strategically located priority parts depots to this has led to better customer service by making available up to an additional  products on a same day delivery basis to over of our stores and  additional products on a next day delivery basis to all of our stores 
this has also allowed us to increase sales to commercial accounts due to the availability of a greater number of replacement parts 
our priority parts operation handles approximately  inquiries each week 
store associates are able to electronically inquire on price and availability and order parts from the priority parts depots through our electronic parts catalog and receive immediate confirmation of availability without having to make telephone inquiries 
we have classified our product mix into separate categories through a merchandising program designed to determine the optimal inventory mix at each individual store based on that store s historical sales 
we believe that we can improve store sales  gross profit margin and inventory turnover by tailoring individual store inventory mix based on historical sales patterns for each of the product categories 
pricing our pricing philosophy is that we should not lose a customer because of price 
our pricing strategy is to offer everyday low prices at each of our stores 
part of this strategy is to beat any competitor s lower price by 
as a result  we closely monitor our competitors pricing levels to ensure competitive pricing in all of our stores 
our entry level products offer excellent value by meeting standard quality requirements at low prices 
in addition  our sales associates are encouraged to offer alternative products at slightly higher price points 
these products typically provide extra features  improved performance  an enhanced warranty or are of national brand recognition 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented our precision pricing program which analyzes prices at the store level rather than at the market or chain level 
this initiative enables us to establish pricing levels at each store based upon that store s local market competition 
advertising we support our marketing and merchandising strategy through print advertising  in store promotional displays and an increasing emphasis on radio and television advertising 
the print advertising consists of monthly color circulars that are produced by our in house advertising department and that contain redeemable coupons 
we also advertise on radio  television and billboards primarily to reinforce our image and name recognition 
television advertising is targeted to sports programming and radio advertising primarily is aired during commuting hours 
advertising efforts include spanish language television and radio as well as bilingual store signage 
in store signs and displays are used to promote products  identify departments  and to announce store specials 
we also sponsor a national hot rod association funny car  a top fuel car and we have been designated the official auto parts store of the nhra 
we have web sites on the internet at http www

store based information systems over the past several years  we installed several store level information systems  which have improved store labor productivity and customer service 
these systems are described below 
electronic parts catalog our electronic parts catalog is a software based system that identifies the location and availability of over one and a half million parts 
the electronic parts catalog is a user friendly tool that enables our sales associates to assist customers in parts selection and ordering based on simple input of the year  model and engine type and application needed 
once provided with this basic information  the electronic parts catalog displays which part is needed and whether it is located in the store 
in the event a particular product is unavailable at a store  the electronic parts catalog indicates whether it can be obtained at a nearby store  priority parts depot  through certain warehouse distributors with same day delivery or directly from the manufacturer 
information about the customer s car can be entered into a permanent customer database that can be instantly accessed whenever the customer visits or phones the store 
the electronic parts catalog also displays related parts that the sales associates can recommend to the customer for purchase and prints parts lists for the customer 
our electronic parts catalog system is integrated with our point of sale system and centralized database 
this integration improves customer service by reducing checkout time by fully automating the ordering process between the parts counter and the point of sale register  allowing the store associate to order parts electronically with immediate confirmation of availability and or delivery  and providing up to the minute pricing of products 
point of sale system we installed a point of sale system consisting of cash registers and sophisticated software in all of our stores  which electronically record and report customer transactions and are tied to our electronic parts catalog and the central inventory system 
this point of sale system improves store productivity and customer service by streamlining in store procedures and eliminating handwritten record keeping 
this system also allows for paperless transactions and electronic updating of warranty information 
in addition  the point of sale software tracks the history of individual customer purchases for use in regionalized marketing and merchandising programs 
retail paperless management system our retail paperless management system is a store based software system used to improve store efficiency 
this system provides for interactive store associate development and testing  communication via company wide e mail  knowledge based interviewing of associate applicants  automated associate time and attendance recording and forms automation 
labor scheduling system we utilize a sophisticated labor scheduling system that allocates labor hours based on factors including forecasted sales and customer traffic counts 
we believe this system enables us to provide superior customer service while providing for improved labor productivity 
satellite communications network our satellite communications network links all of our stores with our corporate office 
the satellite network enables us to efficiently obtain and deliver to our stores all file transfers  including pricing down loads  sales information updates and interactive transactions such as electronic parts ordering 
the system also broadcasts common files to all stores simultaneously to update our electronics parts catalog 
in addition  the satellite network significantly increases the speed of credit card and check authorization 
call center our centralized call center provides store personnel at selected high volume stores the option to reroute customer calls to a central location during the store s busiest hours of operation 
call center associates perform all functions that store personnel normally handle  such as store specific parts look up  price look up and inventory availability verification 
associates in the call center can take an order from a customer and electronically transmit it to the store  so that the customer can pick up the requested product at his local store 
use of the call center allows sales associates to give their undivided attention to customers at the store while call in customers are serviced directly by call center associates 
store operations our stores are divided into seven geographic regions southwest  rocky mountain  northwest  southern california  coastal california  los angeles and northern california 
each region is administered by a regional manager  each of whom oversees six to nine district managers 
each of our district managers has responsibility for between and stores 
the geographic distribution of our stores and the tradenames under which they operated  as of january   are set forth in the table below 
schuck s checker kragen company auto supply auto parts auto parts total california washington arizona colorado utah oregon texas new mexico idaho nevada montana alaska wyoming total our stores are generally open seven days a week  with hours from am to pm pm to pm on sundays 
the average store employs approximately to employees  including a store manager  two assistant store managers and a staff of full time and part time employees 
store formats our stores are generally located in high visibility  high traffic strip shopping centers or in freestanding units adjacent to strip shopping centers 
the stores  which range in size from  to  square feet  average approximately  square feet in size and offer between  and  skus 
we have three prototype store designs which are   and  square feet in size 
the store size for a given new location is selected based upon sales volume expectations determined through demographics and the detailed market analysis that we prepare as part of our site selection process 
the following table categorizes our stores by size  as of january  store size number of stores  sq 
ft 
or greater  sq 
ft  sq 
ft  sq 
ft less than  sq 
ft approximately of our stores are freestanding  with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers 
approximately to of each store s square footage is selling space  of which approximately to is dedicated to automotive replacement parts inventory 
the replacement parts inventory area is fronted by a counter staffed by knowledgeable parts personnel and is equipped with the electronic parts catalog 
the remaining selling space contains gondolas for accessories and maintenance items  including oil and air filters  additives  waxes and other items  together with specifically designed shelving for batteries and  in many stores  oil products 
store growth strategy our store growth strategy is focused on our existing markets and includes opening new stores  relocating smaller stores to larger stores at better locations  and expanding selected stores 
we have identified most of our stores smaller than  square feet as future relocation or expansion priorities 
our market strategy group  which is a part of our real estate department  utilizes a sophisticated  market based approach that identifies and analyzes potential store locations based on detailed demographic and competitive studies 
these demographic and competitive studies include analysis of population density  growth patterns  age  per capita income  vehicle traffic counts and the number and type of existing automotive related facilities  such as automotive parts stores and other competitors within a pre determined radius of the potential new location 
these potential locations are compared to our existing locations to determine opportunities for opening new stores and relocating or expanding existing stores 
we believe that the large number of small operators in our industry has enabled us to effectively pursue an opportunistic acquisition strategy 
we focus our acquisition efforts in existing markets to achieve further market penetration in a timely and cost effective manner without adding additional retail square footage  and contiguous markets to permit further leveraging of our established infrastructure over an increasing sales base 
the following table sets forth our store development activities during the periods indicated fiscal year beginning stores new stores relocated stores acquired stores closed stores including relocated stores ending stores expanded stores total new  relocated and expanded stores we believe that substantial growth opportunities exist in our current markets and that our store growth strategy will increase our name recognition and market penetration while we benefit from economies of scale in advertising  management and distribution costs 
we opened  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal we plan to continue to accelerate our store growth strategy and expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal as of january   we had executed purchase contracts or leases for sites  were in various stages of negotiation for additional sites and had identified numerous potential additional sites for store growth 
new stores generally become profitable during the first year of operation 
commercial sales program in addition to our primary focus on serving the do it yourself consumer  we have significantly increased our marketing efforts to the commercial customer in the automotive replacement parts market 
the commercial market constitutes in excess of of the annual sales in the automotive aftermarket and is currently growing at a faster rate than the do it yourself market 
our commercial sales program  which is intended to facilitate penetration of this market  is targeted to professional mechanics  auto repair shops  auto dealers  fleet owners  mass and general merchandisers with auto repair facilities and other commercial repair outlets located near our stores 
we have made a significant commitment to this portion of our business and upgraded the information systems capabilities available to the commercial sales group 
in addition  we employ one district sales manager for approximately every five stores that have a commercial sales center 
a district sales manager is responsible for servicing existing commercial accounts and developing new commercial accounts 
in addition  at a minimum each commercial sales center has a dedicated in store salesperson  driver and delivery vehicle 
we believe we are well positioned to effectively and profitably service commercial customers  who typically require a higher level of customer service and broad product availability 
the commercial market has traditionally been serviced primarily by jobbers 
recently  however  automotive specialty retailing chains  such as our company  have entered the commercial market 
the chains typically have multiple locations in given market areas and maintain a broad inventory selection 
we believe we have significant competitive advantages in servicing the commercial market because of our experienced sales associates  conveniently located stores  attractive pricing and ability to consistently deliver a broad product offering with an emphasis on national brand names 
as of january   we operated commercial service centers in of our stores 
our sales to commercial accounts including sales by stores without commercial service centers increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal purchasing merchandise is selected from over suppliers and purchased for all stores by personnel at our corporate headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
no one class of product and no single supplier accounted for as much as of our purchases in fiscal our inventory management systems include the e trim buying system  which provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history  trend and seasonality 
combined with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions  the e trim buying system determines the timing and size of purchase orders 
approximately of the dollar value of transactions are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by a computer facsimile interface 
our store replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock 
this includes an automatic model stock adjustment system utilizing historical sales  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also can allocate seasonal and promotional merchandise based upon a store s history of prior promotional and seasonal sales 
our stores offer products with nationally recognized  well advertised brand names  such as armor all  autolite  ac delco  castrol  dayco  exide  fel pro  fram  havoline  mobil  monroe  pennzoil  prestone  quaker state  raybestos  slick  stant  sylvania  turtle wax and valvoline 
in addition to brand name products  our stores carry a wide variety of high quality private label products 
because most of such products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers that produce similar brand name products that enjoy a high degree of consumer acceptance  we believe that our private label products are of a quality that is comparable to such brand name products 
we have increased our gross profit margin over the last several years primarily as a result of obtaining lower product acquisition costs  more favorable vendor terms  cash discounts from vendors  efficiencies from our warehouse and distribution system and improvements in product mix 
we believe that the improved vendor terms are primarily the result of our improved financial performance and stronger capitalization and growth in our store count and purchase volume 
our gross profit margin increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal warehouse and distribution our warehouse and distribution system utilizes bar coding  radio frequency scanners and sophisticated conveyor and put to light systems 
we instituted engineered labor standards and incentive programs in each of our distribution centers which have contributed to improved labor productivity 
each store is currently serviced by one of our two main distribution centers  with the regional distribution centers handling bulk materials  such as oil 
all of our merchandise is shipped by vendors to our distribution centers  with the exception of batteries  which are shipped directly to stores by the vendor 
we have sufficient warehouse and distribution capacity to meet the requirements of our growth plans for the foreseeable future 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to our two main distribution centers as of january  number number of distribution size of stores full time center area served sq 
ft 
served employees phoenix  az arizona  colorado  idaho  nevada  new mexico   california  texas  utah dixon  ca california  nevada  washington  oregon  idaho   montana  wyoming  alaska we have the ability to expand the phoenix distribution center by approximately  square feet and the dixon distribution center by  square feet 
associates as of january   we employed approximately  full time associates and  part time associates 
approximately of these personnel are employed in store level operations  in distribution and in our corporate headquarters  including our call center and priority parts operation 
we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that our labor relations are very good 
except for associates located at approximately stores in the san jose  california market  who have been represented by a union for more than years  none of our personnel are represented by a labor union 
competition we compete principally in the do it yourself sector of the automotive aftermarket which is highly fragmented and generally very competitive 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains such as autozone  inc and the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations  such as napa  automobile dealers and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories such as wal mart stores  inc 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores like ours  with multiple locations in regional markets  have competitive advantages in marketing  product selection  purchasing and distribution  as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
we believe that  as a result of these advantages  national and regional chains have been gaining market share in recent years at the expense of independent retailers and jobbers 
the principal competitive factors that affect our business are store location  customer service  product selection  availability  quality and price 
while we believe that we compete effectively in our various geographic areas  certain competitors are larger in terms of sales volume  have greater financial and management resources and have been operating longer in certain geographic areas 
trade names  service marks and trademarks we own and have registered the service mark schuck s with the united states patent and trademark office for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
we have the right to use the tradenames checker in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in the west and southeast regions of the united states and kragen 
in addition  we own and have registered numerous trademarks with respect to many of our private label products 
we believe that our various tradenames  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy  but that our business is not otherwise dependent on any particular service mark  tradename or trademark 
there are no infringing uses known by us that materially affect the use of such marks 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and regarding ownership and operation of real property 
we handle hazardous materials during our operations  and our customers may also use or bring hazardous materials onto our properties 
in addition  while we do not service automobiles  we do sublease to third parties pre existing service bays at a small number of store locations 
these third parties are required to dispose of certain items  including used batteries  lubricants and oils in accordance with applicable environmental regulations 
we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and for the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors 
pursuant to the agreements  the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates  deposited into vendor supplied containers pallets and then disposed of by the third party vendors 
our agreements with such vendors are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any harm caused by the batteries and lubricants to off site properties or even on site when such failure is the fault of the vendor 
many of the agreements provide us with indemnification against liability that we may incur in connection with the disposal of such items 
under environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
we do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations has had a material impact on our operations to date  but there can be no assurance that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us

item legal proceedings we were served with a lawsuit that was filed in the superior court in san diego  california on may  the case is brought by two former store managers and a former assistant manager 
it purports to be a class action for all present and former california store managers and senior assistant managers and seeks overtime pay for a period beginning in may as well as injunctive relief requiring overtime pay in the future 
this case is in the early stages of discovery 
we were recently served with two other lawsuits purporting to be class actions filed in california state courts in orange and fresno counties by thirteen other former and current employees 
these lawsuits include similar claims to the san diego lawsuit  except that they also include claims for unfair business practices which seek overtime from october the orange county lawsuit initially included a claim for punitive damages based on an unlawful conversion theory 
on march   the orange county court dismissed the conversion theory and claim for punitive damages but gave the plaintiff days to refile an amended claim 
these plaintiffs have since filed an amended complaint which also includes a claim for conversion and asks for punitive damages 
we have again requested the court to eliminate these items from the case 
the three cases have recently been coordinated before one judge in san diego county who will be selected shortly 
if these cases are permitted by the courts to proceed as a class action and are decided against us  our aggregate potential exposure could be material to our results of operations for the year in which the cases are ultimately decided 
we do not believe  however  that such an adverse outcome  if it were to happen  would materially affect our financial position or our operations in subsequent periods 
although at this early stage in the litigation it is difficult to predict their outcomes with any certainty  we believe that we have meritorious defenses to all of these cases and intend to defend them vigorously 
we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
the damages claimed against us in some of these litigations are substantial 
although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained  we do not currently believe that  in the aggregate  they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of fiscal part ii item market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters our common stock has been listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cao since march  as of april   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding

csk auto  inc has no current intention of paying dividends or making other distributions to us in excess of amounts necessary to pay our operating expenses and taxes

excluding these non recurring items  net of related income tax benefit thereon  net income for the fiscal year was million or per diluted share based on million shares outstanding 
in december  we acquired trak west stores which have been included in results of operations from the date of acquisition

our fiscal results also include a charge of million to reflect the store closing costs of specific store sites 
this charge is included in operating and administrative expenses 
results of operations in fiscal include pre opening expenses of million associated with the opening of our new distribution center in phoenix  arizona 
our fiscal operating and administrative expenses also include million of software development costs associated with the new store level information systems we installed during fiscal in addition  we believe that our operations and operating results were adversely impacted during fiscal as a result of the start up costs associated with the implementation of many new initiatives 
net income in fiscal includes an extraordinary gain of million resulting from cancellation of a portion of our long term debt 
ebitda represents income before net interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  other non cash charges  extraordinary items and non recurring charges 
while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as measured by gaap  it is included herein because we believe it is a meaningful measure which provides additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
ebitda has been calculated as described above in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued and may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the computation of ebitda for each of the respective periods shown is as follows fiscal year in thousands income loss before income taxes and extraordinary gain loss      add back interest expense  net      depreciation and amortization expense      non recurring recapitalization expenses   other non recurring and non cash charges    total      ebitdar represents ebitda plus operating lease rental expense 
because the proportion of stores leased versus owned varies among industry competitors  we believe that ebitdar permits a meaningful comparison of operating performance among industry competitors 
we lease substantially all of our stores 
represents sales to commercial accounts  including sales from stores without commercial sales centers 
comparable store net sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales commencing after the time a new store has been open twelve months 
therefore  sales for the first twelve months a new store is open are not included in the comparable store calculation 
relocations are included in comparable store net sales from the date of opening 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to january and is named for the calendar year just ended 
occasionally this results in a fiscal year which is weeks long 
when we refer to a particular fiscal year  we mean the following fiscal means the weeks ended january   fiscal means the weeks ended february   and fiscal means the weeks ended february  general csk auto corporation is the largest retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest retailers of these products in the united states based  in each case  on our number of stores 
as of january   we operated stores as one fully integrated company under three brand names checker auto parts  founded in and operating in the southwestern and rocky mountain states  schuck s auto supply  founded in and operating in the pacific northwest  and kragen auto parts  founded in and operating primarily in california 
over the past several years  we have implemented a variety of initiatives which have enabled us to significantly increase our productivity and the level and quality of service we provide to customers 
these initiatives include expanding our product selection and priority parts operation  converting our warehouse and distribution system to a technologically advanced  fully integrated system  installing sophisticated store level information systems  accelerating our store growth strategy  and expanding our commercial sales program

we intend to finance our cash requirements with cash flow from operations  funds from our leasing facility and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at january   we had net working capital of approximately million and total liquidity cash plus availability under our revolving credit facility of approximately million 
we also have access to an off balance sheet operating lease facility that is used to finance new store construction 
the facility gives us up to million of funding to provide for the acquisition and development of to new stores over the period of february  through may  as of january   approximately million of this million leasing facility had been committed 
our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million  of which million of unused capacity was available at january  we believe that cash flow from operations combined with the availability of funds under the leasing facility and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
we opened new  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal and new  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal we expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these new  relocated or expanded stores will be financed by our lease facility under arrangements structured as operating leases that require no net capital expenditures except for fixtures and store equipment 
for the remainder of our planned new  relocated or expanded stores  we expect to spend approximately  per store for leasehold improvements 
in addition to capital expenditures  each new store will require an estimated investment in working capital  principally for inventories  of approximately  new stores generally become profitable during the first full year of operations 
in addition to capital expenditures for new stores  we expect to spend approximately million over the next year for information systems hardware and software approximately million of which is related to the year issue discussed below

year conversion historically  certain computerized systems have used two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer equipment and software and devices with imbedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  resulting in system failures or miscalculations 
this problem is generally referred to as the year issue 
during fiscal  we began a comprehensive review of our systems and applications for year compliance 
we also engaged an independent advisor to evaluate and assist us with our year program 
to date  we have substantially completed the identification and assessment phases of our year conversion 
we have included both information technology  such as purchased software and point of sale computer systems  and non information technology equipment  such as warehouse conveyor systems  in our evaluations 
in addition  we have identified our key third party business partners and we are coordinating with them to address potential year issues 
these issues include data exchange with us as well as their shipping and warehousing processes 
although we anticipate minimal business disruption will occur in our systems as a result of the year issue  possible consequences include a loss of communications links with certain store locations  and the inability to process transactions  send purchase orders  or engage in similar normal business activities 
we presently believe that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the risk of our year conversion can be mitigated 
however  if we do not make the necessary modifications and conversions  or do not complete them in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we currently anticipate that our year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts  will be completed by july   although we will continue to run system tests throughout the remainder of the year 
as of january   we have completed approximately of our year initiatives 
to date  we have incurred and expensed approximately million related to the assessment of and preliminary efforts in connection with our year conversion project 
to date  we have also capitalized approximately million in connection with the replacement of certain hardware and software applications 
we estimate the total remaining cost of our year conversion to be million  which is being funded with lease financing and operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  we attribute approximately million to the purchase of new hardware and software which will be capitalized 
we will expense the remaining million as incurred over the next fiscal year 
we have begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from our failure and the failure of certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
we are currently developing contingency plans which should be finalized by june  elements of our contingency plans may include switching vendors  back up systems or manual processes  and the stockpiling of certain products prior to the year the costs of our year conversion and the date on which we plan to complete the project are based upon our management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these estimates 
specific factors that could cause material differences between our actual results and our estimates include the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the success of third parties in their year conversion plans  and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
quarterly results and seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of june through august overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
our business is  in addition  affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales as our customers tend to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal and the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
the data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included herein

operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal was negatively affected by non recurring charges of 
million related to the secondary offering 
net income in the first quarter of fiscal was negatively affected by a million extraordinary loss  net of a million benefit for income taxes  which consisted of prepayment premiums paid in connection with redemption of debt and the write off of a portion of deferred debt issuance costs  as well as by the charges discussed in note above  net of income taxes 
the sum of the quarterly earnings loss per share amounts within a fiscal year differ from the total earnings loss per share for the fiscal year due to the impact of differing weighted average share outstanding calculations 
operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal was negatively affected by million of transition and integration expenses related to the acquisition of former trak west stores and by million of stock based compensation 
net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal was negatively affected by an extraordinary loss of million related to the write off of the deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of debt as well as by the charges discussed in note above  net of income taxes 
inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we believe that we will be able to mitigate the effects of future merchandise cost increases principally through economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes new standards for the way that public companies report selected information about operating segments in interim and annual financial statements 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our financial statements since we operate in a single segment 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement was adopted during fiscal and only required certain disclosures in our financial statements 
the adoption did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop defines the characteristics of internal use computer software  criteria for capitalization and financial statement disclosure requirements 
we will adopt sop in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect that such adoption will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  reporting on the cost of start up activities 
the sop broadly defines start up activities as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  or commencing some new operation 
the sop requires that the costs of start up activities be expensed as incurred 
our current accounting policy with respect to the cost of start up activities store preopening expenses is to defer such costs for the approximately three month period of time that it takes to develop a new store facility and to expense such costs during the month that the new store opens 
we will adopt sop in the first quarter of fiscal  which will require us to change our current accounting policy to expense start up costs as incurred 
upon adoption  we will expense approximately million of preopening expenses deferred as of january  such expense will be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our senior credit facility is variable rate and  accordingly  sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we believe the potential exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our financial position or the results of operations
