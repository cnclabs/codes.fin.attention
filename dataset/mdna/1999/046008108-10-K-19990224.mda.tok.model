item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a leading diversified finance organization  which provides finance  leasing and related services to individual consumers and businesses 
the company s revenues principally consist of finance charge income and  to a lesser extent  insurance premiums and investment and other fee income 
the company s primary expenses are interest expense from the funding of its finance business  provision for loan losses and operating expenses 
a principal factor determining the profitability of the company is finance charge revenue less interest expense net interest margin 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto 
managed basis reporting the discussion that follows includes comparisons of amounts reported in the historical financial statements owned basis and on a pro forma basis adjusted to include the impact of receivables held for sale and receivables sold with servicing retained managed basis 
unless specifically identified as managed or managed basis  the financial information contained herein is presented on a basis consistent with the amounts reported in the historical financial statements on an owned basis 
on an owned basis  finance charges and service fee income  interest expense and credit losses on the held for sale and servicing portfolios are included in investment and other income in the statement of earnings 
on a pro forma managed basis  these items are reclassified from investment and other income and presented as if the receivables neither had been held for sale nor sold 
because an economic interest is retained in all receivables managed by the company  management believes the discussion of pro forma managed basis information is useful in evaluating the company s operating performance 
the following table contains selected owned basis and pro forma managed basis financial information in millions year ended or at december owned pro forma managed owned pro forma managed basis adjustments basis basis adjustments basis finance charges      insurance premiums investment and other income total revenue     interest expense     operating expenses     provision for losses     insurance benefits paid or provided total expenses     earnings before provision for income taxes     provision for income taxes net earnings     net finance receivables end of period       average       pro forma information is not presented above for the year ended or at december  because the difference between owned and managed basis financial information for this period was not significant 
results of operations summary of results of operations the following table summarizes the company s earnings and related data dollars in millions earnings and related data year ended december earnings before provision for income taxes    net earnings   change in net earnings amount percent basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share return on average managed assets on average equity on average adjusted equity during the first quarter of  the company paid a billion dividend to ford  of which billion was in the form of an intercompany interest bearing note 
the company repaid the note during the second quarter of and received billion in proceeds from its initial public offering 
the amounts presented for exclude the effect of these transactions 
excludes the push down goodwill created by ford s acquisition of foreign affiliates of the company in earnings before provision for income taxes and net earnings increased in each of the years ended december   and the principal factor  which influenced the changes in the company s net earnings in each period was an increase in earning assets 
the increase in earning assets directly affects net interest margin  operating expenses and provision for loan losses  all of which are described in the sections that follow 
the company derived approximately of its earnings before provision for income taxes in from its international finance segment 
management believes that the overall economic factors and trends affecting the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries have not materially affected the profitability of the company taken as a whole 
see the discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation in the market risk section that follows and in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
net interest margin managed basis the company s managed basis net interest margin was as follows dollars in millions net interest margin managed basis year ended december amount of amr amount of amr amount of amr domestic consumer finance segment    commercial finance segment international finance segment  total company    expressed as a percentage of average managed receivables amr of the respective segment for the period 
the net interest margin excludes non recurring interest costs related to the public offering the ipo of the company s class a common stock 
excludes the effect of the ipo 
managed basis net interest margin increased on a dollar basis in each segment primarily due to growth in average managed finance receivables 
managed basis net interest margin expressed as a percentage of average managed receivables outstanding during each period declined in each segment primarily due to declining finance charge yields  partially offset by declining borrowing rates 
finance charges managed basis the finance charge revenue and yield for the company were as follows dollars in millions finance charges managed basis year ended december finance charge revenue    yield calculated as finance charge revenue as a percentage of average managed finance receivables outstanding for the indicated period 
finance charge revenue increased  on a dollar basis  primarily due to the growth in the average managed finance receivables during each period 
the principal factors which influence the trend of finance charge yields are i the composition of the finance receivable portfolios ie  product mix  ii the interest rate environment  and iii the level of business competition 
a generally declining interest rate environment  changes in product mix and increased competition were the primary causes of the movements in finance charge yield from to interest expense managed basis total dollars of managed interest expense increased in each of the three years ended in each year the increase was principally due to higher average outstanding debt as a result of the company s growth in net finance receivables 
the increase in managed basis interest expense as a result of growth in and was partially offset by a decline in the company s average borrowing rate in each period 
declines in the company s average borrowing rate were primarily caused by decreasing market interest rates and by a modest shift toward a higher percentage of floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt 
floating rate debt rates were lower than long term debt rates in each period 
insurance premium revenue insurance premium revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
insurance premium revenue  which is earned over the coverage term  increased million in  million in  and million in the insurance operation is engaged in underwriting credit related and other specialized insurance products for customers of the domestic consumer  commercial and international business segments 
therefore  insurance sales  and resulting revenue  are largely dependent on business activities and volume 
the increase in insurance revenue in each of the years was principally caused by increased sales of insurance products associated with the increase in net finance receivables outstanding 
the company expanded its insurance operations with the december acquisition of the northland company and the january acquisition of the insurance operations of avco financial services  inc these acquisitions did not have a significant impact on operating results 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about these acquisitions 
investment and other income managed basis managed basis investment and other income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
managed basis investment income is derived from realized and unrealized returns on the company s investments in trading securities and realized returns on investments in available for sale securities  both of which are principally owned by the company s insurance operation 
managed basis other income is primarily derived from fee based services  such as employee relocation services  emergency roadside assistance  auto club services  point of sale transaction services and inbound telemarketing services 
the increase in investment and other income from through was principally due to higher investment income due to the growth in the company s investment portfolio and growth in fee based businesses 
operating expenses operating expenses  on an owned and managed basis  were as follows dollars in millions operating expenses year ended december amount amr amount amr amount amr salaries and benefits   advertising data processing occupancy other total    managed basis efficiency ratio total operating expenses on a dollar basis increased from to  principally due to increased levels of business volume and outstanding receivables in each of the years 
as a percentage of average managed receivables  total operating expenses decreased from to and remained flat in in addition  the company s total managed operating efficiency  as measured by the ratio of total operating expenses to managed basis revenues net of managed basis interest expense and insurance benefits paid or provided the managed basis efficiency ratio improved from to but declined slightly in the decline is primarily due to a decline in managed basis net interest margin during allowance for losses  losses and asset quality the company maintains an allowance for losses on finance receivables at an amount  which it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolios 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience  and reflects management s judgment of additional loss potential considering future economic conditions and the nature and characteristics of the underlying finance receivables 
for purposes of measuring business segment profitability  each business unit establishes an allowance for loan loss when a loan is made through a charge to the provision for losses 
the company manages its allowance for losses on finance receivables on a company wide basis taking into account actual and expected losses in each business unit  the relationship of the allowance for losses to net finance receivables outstanding and the relationship of the allowance for losses to total net credit losses 
the resulting charge is included in the provision for losses 
finance receivables are charged to the allowance for losses when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
additionally  the company s policy provides for charge off of various types of accounts on a contractual basis described as follows consumer direct and other installment and credit card receivables are charged to the allowance for losses when they become days contractually delinquent 
all other finance receivables are charged to the allowance for losses when any of the following conditions occur i the related security has been converted or destroyed  ii the related security has been repossessed and sold or held for sale for one year  or iii the related security has not been repossessed and the receivable has become one year contractually delinquent 
a contractually delinquent account is one on which the customer has not made payments as contractually agreed 
finance charge accruals are suspended on accounts when they become days contractually delinquent 
the accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current 
at december  and  net finance receivables on which revenue was not accrued approximated billion and billion  respectively 
the interest income that would have been recorded in if these nonaccruing receivables had been current was approximately million 
the balance of the allowance for losses was principally influenced by the provision for losses and by net credit loss experience 
additions to the allowance  due to growth in finance receivables  were generally charged to the provision for losses at the time the growth occurred 
losses were charged to the allowance as incurred and recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance were credited to the allowance at the time the recovery was collected 
the components of the changes in the allowance for losses were as follows dollars in millions components of changes in the allowance for losses year ended december balance at beginning of period    provision for losses    recoveries on receivables charged off losses sustained    net credit loss experience   reserves of receivables sold reserves of acquired businesses and other balance at end of period    allowance for losses to net finance receivables loss coverage ratio x x x the reserves related to receivables sold during and were not significant 
the figure represents the ratio of allowance for losses to annualized second  third and fourth quarter owned basis losses 
the and amounts reflect the allowance for losses to total owned basis net credit losses for the respective year 
first quarter losses are not reflected in the ratio because they were incurred before the second quarter securitization of approximately billion of credit card receivables 
losses incurred after this transaction are more representative of current loss levels 
the allowance for losses as a percent of net finance receivables increased in and declined in the decline in was principally due to the securitization of approximately billion of the company s us bankcard credit card receivables to a master trust 
this transaction contributed to a general shift in product mix during towards more secured portfolios 
secured portfolios generally have lower losses and therefore lower allowance requirements than unsecured portfolios 
the loss coverage ratio allowance for losses as a percent of net credit losses decreased in and increased in  reflecting the aforementioned us bankcard securitization transaction 
management believes the allowance for losses at december  is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolios 
although the allowance for losses on finance receivables reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  is considered adequate by the company s management  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with the company s finance receivables 
this allowance may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected to the extent that the company s allowance is insufficient to cover such changes or events 
the company s managed basis days contractual delinquency and managed basis net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables amr for each of these years are set forth in the following table dollars in millions managed basis contractual delinquency and net credit losses year ended or at december days contractual delinquency domestic consumer finance segment commercial finance segment international finance segment total total dollars delinquent    net credit losses to amr domestic consumer finance segment commercial finance segment international finance segment total total dollars   the domestic consumer finance segment s managed net credit losses to amr increased from to primarily due to increased consumer bankruptcy levels 
while the rate of increase in consumer bankruptcy levels slowed in  it was a primary factor contributing to higher losses in the growth in the company s private label receivable portfolio  due primarily to the sps acquisition in the fourth quarter of  also contributed to higher losses 
private label receivables are unsecured and typically have higher losses than the segment s secured portfolios 
these loss increases in were partially offset by the lower loss rates associated with the strong growth in the home equity lending portfolio during home equity lending receivables typically have lower losses than unsecured receivable portfolios 
the commercial finance segment s managed net credit losses to amr increased in over and levels primarily due to higher losses in the retail manufactured housing portfolio and in the truck and truck trailer financing portfolios 
the international finance segment s managed net credit losses to amr increased in each comparable period 
the increase in was primarily driven by the acquisition of beneficial canada holdings incorporated during the first quarter of  and the acquisition of dic finance co 
ltd  in the second quarter of these acquisitions resulted in a shift in segment product mix towards more unsecured portfolios 
unsecured portfolios typically have higher losses than secured portfolios 
rising bankruptcy levels also contributed to the segment increase and was the primary cause of the increase in compared to insurance benefits paid or provided insurance benefits paid or provided were million in  million in and million in benefits paid or provided are influenced by the amount of insurance in force  underwriting standards  loss experience  term of coverage and product mix 
benefits paid or provided increased in as compared to and  primarily as a result of more insurance in force 
provision for income taxes the company s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates were as follows dollars in millions provision for income taxes year ended december effective effective effective tax tax tax amount rate amount rate amount rate us statutory us state income taxes non deductible goodwill foreign rates in excess of us rate and other provision for income taxes the effective tax rate decreased in and principally due to an increase in the utilization of foreign tax credits available to the company 
the available foreign tax credits primarily related to estimated taxes paid or accrued by the company on its japan based earnings 
in addition  the company was allocated million and million in foreign tax credits under the tax sharing agreement with ford in and  respectively 
the increase in non deductible goodwill in is due primarily to the acquisition of the stock of beneficial canada holdings incorporated as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company provides income taxes on its foreign earnings at the statutory tax rate in effect for the applicable country where such earnings arise 
the principal foreign earnings of the company arise from its operations in japan  where the statutory tax rate is significantly higher than the us statutory tax rate 
financial condition growth in managed finance receivables the company experienced growth in managed finance receivables in and as follows dollars in millions growth in managed finance receivables year ended or at december increase from increase from prior year prior year balance amount balance amount domestic consumer finance     commercial finance     international finance    total managed receivables     approximately and of the growth in managed net finance receivables during and  respectively  resulted from internal sources  principally through increased penetration in its existing markets  entry into new markets and offering of new products 
the remaining growth portion  in both years  was from the acquisition of finance receivables and businesses 
debt total outstanding debt was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
such amounts of debt reflect net increases of billion in and billion in in both years  the increase was primarily a result of the growth in net finance receivables 
at december  and  short term debt  including the current portion of long term debt  as a percent of total debt was and  respectively 
the current portion of long term debt at december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
stockholders equity stockholders equity increased to billion in from billion in this increase was primarily due to net earnings and the issuance of billion of class a common stock in november of this increase in stockholders equity was partially offset in and by dividends paid of million and million  respectively and unrealized foreign currency translation losses of million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency movements were partially offset through the company s use of derivative financial instruments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity was also adjusted in and by net unrealized losses gains of million and million  respectively  related to investments in available for sale securities 
liquidity capital resources through its asset and liability management function  the company maintains a disciplined approach to the management of liquidity  capital  interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk 
the company has a formal process for managing its liquidity to ensure that funds are available at all times to meet the company s commitments 
the company s principal sources of cash are proceeds from the issuance of short and long term debt  asset securitizations and cash provided from the company s operations 
management believes that the company has available sufficient liquidity from a combination of cash provided from operations  external borrowings and asset securitizations to support its operations 
a principal strength of the company is its ability to access the global debt markets in a cost efficient manner 
continued access to the public and private debt markets is critical to the company s ability to continue to fund its operations 
the company seeks to maintain a conservative liquidity position and actively manages its liability and capital levels  debt maturities  diversification of funding sources and asset liquidity to ensure that it is able to meet its obligations as they mature 
the company s domestic operations are principally funded through domestic and international borrowings and  to a lesser extent  asset securitizations 
the company s foreign subsidiaries are principally financed through a combination of private and public debt borrowings in the transactional currency and through fully hedged intercompany borrowings 
at december  and  the company had short and long term debt outstanding of billion and billion  respectively 
short term debt principally consists of commercial paper and represents the company s primary source of short term liquidity 
long term debt principally consists of senior unsecured long term debt issued publicly and privately by the company s primary domestic operating subsidiary  associates corporation of north america associates in the united states and abroad  and to a lesser extent  private and public borrowings made by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
during the year ended december  and  the company raised term debt aggregating billion and billion  respectively  through public and private offerings 
substantial additional liquidity is available to the company s operations through established credit facilities in support of its net short term borrowings 
such credit facilities provide a means of refinancing its maturing short term obligations as needed 
at december   these credit facilities totaled billion and were allocated to provide at least backup coverage of the company s commercial paper borrowings and utilized uncommitted lines of credit 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has access to other sources of liquidity such as the issuance of alternative forms of capital  the issuance of common and preferred stock and the use of asset securitization 
prior to  the company s securitization transactions were limited to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle receivable portfolios 
in  the company expanded its securitization activity to include its home equity and credit card asset backed classes 
the company has entered into various support agreements on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries 
under these support agreements  the company has either guaranteed specific issues of such subsidiaries debt or agreed to supervise operations in a responsible manner and to provide additional support on a lender s reasonable request 
see notes  and to the company s consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings and currency hedging activities 
market risk the risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in the company s product and debt mix and developments in the global financial markets 
the analytical methods used by the company to assess and mitigate these risks should not be considered projections of future events or operating performance 
the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of movements in interest rates and foreign currency 
interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the principal goal of the company s risk management program is to reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on the company s financial position and operating performance 
the company utilizes derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange agreements and currency swaps as well as interest rate swap and treasury lock agreements  as part of its overall risk management program 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s use of derivative financial instruments 
the company also believes that its overall balance sheet structure has repricing and cash flow characteristics that mitigate the impact of interest rate movements 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is measured and controlled through the use of static gap analysis and financial forecasting  both of which incorporate assumptions as to future events 
the company s gap position is defined as the sum of floating rate asset balances and scheduled principal payments on fixed rate assets  less the sum of floating rate liability balances and scheduled principal payments on fixed rate liabilities 
the company measures its gap position at various time horizons  ranging from one month to five years 
the company seeks to maintain a negative three and six month gap  and a positive one year gap 
the company completed the acquisition of avco on january  the december  computations set forth in this section have been adjusted to give effect to the company s investment activities in connection with the raising of the billion purchase price of avco  which activities were initiated prior to december  at december  and the one year gap was a positive and  respectively 
the company s positive one year gap target range indicates that a greater percentage of assets than liabilities reprice within a one year time frame 
in addition to the gap analysis  the company uses a simulation model to evaluate the impact on earnings under a variety of scenarios 
these scenarios may include a change in the absolute level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  prepayments  interest rate spread relationships and changes in the volumes and rates of various asset and liability categories 
for an immediate increase in rates  projected annual after tax earnings would have declined by approximately million at december  and an immediate rise in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario  used to calibrate risk  and does not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
for purposes of the united states securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements  the company has also performed an enterprise wide value at risk var analysis of the company s financial assets and liabilities and their exposure to changes in interest rates 
the var was calculated using an historical simulation risk model to calculate changes in earnings due to changes in interest rates on all significant on and off balance sheet exposures 
the simulation generates monthly interest rate scenarios over a forecast horizon of months 
the var analysis calculates the potential after tax earnings at risk associated from changes in interest rates  within a confidence level 
the model assumes interest rates are normally distributed and draws volatilities from various market sources 
at december  and  interest rate movements would affect annual after tax earnings by less than million and million  respectively  as calculated under the var methodology 
foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of its non united states denominated foreign investments 
the company has employed a variety of risk management tools such as borrowing and lending in the local currencies as well as using derivative instruments to hedge its investment in foreign subsidiaries 
the company has also performed a var analysis on the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the var is calculated using an historical simulation model to calculate changes in earnings from foreign currency risk on all significant on and off balance sheet exposures 
the simulation generates interest rate scenarios over a month horizon and calculates the potential after tax earnings at risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations  with a confidence level as required under applicable united states securities and exchange commission rules 
the model assumes currency prices are normally distributed and draws volatility and cross currency correlation data from jp morgan risk metrics tm 
at december  and  currency volatility would affect annual after tax earnings by less than million and million  respectively  as calculated under the var methodology 
the company utilizes a wide variety of risk management methods  including those discussed above  and believes that no single risk model provides a reliable method of monitoring and controlling risk 
while these models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative risk information generated is limited by the model parameters 
therefore  such models do not substitute for the experience or judgment of the company s management to adjust positions and revise strategies as deemed necessary 
year compliance the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process date fields containing a digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches  if such systems are not repaired they may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
the company has a company wide initiative to address the year compliance issue 
a team of technology professionals began addressing the year compliance issue in since then  the company has identified all significant third party and internal applications that require modification to ensure year compliance 
the company divides its year compliance initiative into two components  information technology it and non information technology non it 
the it initiative includes third party and the company s mainframe and desktop systems and applications 
the non it initiative includes third party suppliers  embedded systems and the company s larger commercial borrowers 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required it modifications and test year compliance 
while the modification and testing process of all critical applications is substantially complete these applications will undergo additional testing during in addition  the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to provide independent system verification and validation of year compliance 
the company acquires businesses from time to time 
during its review of a potential acquisition  the company performs a year readiness review to determine that the potential acquisition s systems either are or will be year compliant in a timely manner 
on january  the company purchased avco 
the company expects all avco it applications to be year compliant by the third quarter of the company s non it efforts include ensuring third party suppliers  embedded systems and the company s larger commercial borrowers are year compliant 
the company has communicated with third party suppliers that provide critical products or services  providers of significant embedded systems and large commercial borrowers to determine their year compliance readiness and is testing and monitoring the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to any significant year issues 
initial phases of contingency plans are being activated for these suppliers and borrowers who have not provided the company with certification of their year compliance 
contingency planning is an integral part of the company s year readiness project 
the company has and is continuing to develop contingency plans  which document the processes necessary to maintain critical business functions should a significant third party system or critical internal system fail 
these contingency plans generally include the repair of existing systems and  in some instances  the use of alternative systems or procedures 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  there are many risks associated with the year compliance issue  including but not limited to the possible failure of the company s computer and information technology systems 
any such failure could have a material adverse affect on the company including the inability to properly bill and collect payments from customers and errors or omissions in accounting and financial data 
in addition  the company is exposed to the inability of third parties to perform as a result of year compliance 
any such failure by a third party bank  regulatory agency  group of investors  securities exchange or clearing agency  software product or service provider  utility or other entity may have a material adverse financial or operational effect on the company 
through december  the company has incurred and expensed approximately million for incremental costs primarily related to third party vendors  outside contractors and additional staff dedicated to the year readiness project 
the company currently expects that it will incur future incremental costs related to the project of approximately million 
these incremental costs do not include existing resources allocated to the project effort or the costs that will be incurred by the company related to the acquisitions that are expected to close during the incremental year costs related to these future acquisitions are not expected to be material to the company 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives would depend on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company has not yet determined the impact sfas will have on its earnings or financial position
