minimum wage increases the company employs  both in its stores and in its corporate headquarters  a substantial number of employees who earn hourly wages near or at the minimum wage 
actions by both the federal and certain state governments have increased the hourly wages payable by the company to such employees 
to mitigate the impact of this wage increase  the company has instituted policies to manage its ratio of wages to sales 
management believes that these measures will be adequate to control the impact of hourly wage increases on the overall profitability of its operations 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company historically has realized its highest level of sales and income during the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year the quarters ending in october and january as a result of the back to school august and september and christmas november and december seasons 
the seasonally lower sales in the company s first two quarters february through july  can result in the company s incurring losses during those quarters even in years in which it will have full year profits 
year issue many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or fail 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with year requirements 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources as applicable  to identify  correct or reprogram its internal systems for year compliance 
the effect on the company s future results of operations is being determined as part of the detailed conversion process 
in february  the company implemented a new integrated software package to support future growth and to address the issues associated with the year this system implementation substantially completed the company s internal program to address the company s year issues 
the new software installation cost million 
the company is currently seeking to insure that the software and operating systems included in its new integrated software package are year compliant 
the company is also in the process of requesting information and assurances from its major vendors  service providers and customers about their state of year compliance and readiness 
in the event that significant year issues are identified with such parties  the company will develop contingency plans such as the use of alternate vendors or manual systems
