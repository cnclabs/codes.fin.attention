overview we reported net income of million in  compared to million in this decrease in net income primarily reflects the million decrease in operating cash flow as defined below in our television broadcasting and sports entertainment segments and an increase in income tax expense  offset by a million increase in operating cash flow in our out of home and radio broadcasting segments and a million gain on the sale of our airport advertising operations in the decrease also reflects higher net income in that included a million income tax benefit  resulting from recognition of our deferred tax asset  and million reduction for litigation expenses  partially offset by a million charge for stock compensation expense 
operating cash flow was million in  compared to million in refinancing 
in january  we replaced our million credit agreement the credit agreement with a million credit agreement the credit agreement 
we replaced the credit agreement with the new million credit agreement in january in october  we used borrowings under the term loan facility of the credit agreement to redeem our million senior secured notes due the senior secured notes 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million  net of applicable taxes of million  consisting of prepayment fees and the write off of deferred financing costs 
we issued senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amounts of million in december and million in february in march  we redeemed the million outstanding principal of our senior subordinated notes due december  the senior subordinated notes 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million net of applicable taxes of million  consisting primarily of prepayment fees

disposition of assets 
in june  we sold substantially all of the assets of our airport advertising operations for a base cash price of million  paid on the closing date of the transaction  and an additional cash payment of approximately million 
we recorded a gain from this transaction of million in acquisitions and time brokerage agreements 
we have acquired or entered into agreements to acquire several television and radio stations  or to operate the stations under time brokerage agreements 
the transactions are more fully described in item business and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as with many media companies that have grown through acquisitions  our acquisitions and dispositions of television and radio stations have resulted in significant non cash and non recurring charges to income 
for this reason  in addition to net income  our management believes that operating cash flow defined as net revenue less operating expenses before amortization  depreciation  interest  litigation  and stock compensation expenses is an appropriate measure of our financial performance 
similarly  we believe that segment operating cash flow defined as operating cash flow before corporate overhead is an appropriate measure of our segments financial performance 
these measures exclude certain expenses that management does not consider to be costs of ongoing operations 
we use operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on our long term debt as well as to finance capital expenditures 
operating cash flow and segment operating cash flow  however  are not to be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity

on october   we used borrowings under the term loan facility of the credit agreement to redeem our million senior secured notes 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million  net of applicable taxes  consisting of prepayment fees and the write off of deferred financing costs 
also on october   we repaid all amounts outstanding under the partnership credit agreement with proceeds from the revolving credit facility of the credit agreement 
on december   we issued senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
these notes were issued under the indenture  which allows for an aggregate principal amount of up to million of senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes bear interest at  which is payable semi annually in january and july 
principal is payable in full in january in connection with our time brokerage agreements with the owners of television stations wutr and kion  we have guaranteed certain bank loan obligations of the station owners

our capital expenditures in included the acquisition and refurbishment of a new aircraft for the seattle supersonics 
this capital expenditure was financed by separate aircraft loans in the aggregate principal amount of million  of which million was outstanding as of december  our management anticipates that capital expenditures  consisting primarily of construction and maintenance of billboard structures  broadcasting equipment  and other capital additions  will be between million and million 
this forward looking statement is  however  subject to the qualifications set forth under forward looking statements above 
for the fiscal years through  we have financed our working capital needs primarily from cash provided by operating activities 
over that period  our long term liquidity needs  including for acquisitions  have been financed through additions to our long term debt  principally through bank borrowings and the sale of senior and subordinated debt securities 
capital expenditures for new property and equipment have been financed with both cash provided by operating activities and long term debt 
cash provided by operating activities for decreased to million from million in this decrease is mainly due to the decrease in operating cash flow for  as described above 
subsequent events on january   we replaced the credit agreement with the new million credit agreement  consisting of a million term loan facility the term loan and a revolving credit facility the revolver  which includes up to million in standby letters of credit 
under the credit agreement  we can choose to have interest calculated at rates based on either a base rate or libor plus defined margins which vary based on our total leverage ratio 
as of march   the annual interest rate of borrowings under the credit agreement was approximately 
as of march   we had borrowed million of the term loan and million of the revolver 
principal repayments under the term loan are due quarterly from march  through december  the revolver requires scheduled annual commitment reductions  with required principal prepayments of outstanding amounts in excess of the commitment levels  quarterly beginning march  on february   we issued additional senior subordinated notes under the indenture in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the total aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes issued and outstanding is million 
on march   we redeemed the million outstanding principal of our senior subordinated notes with borrowings under our credit agreement s revolver 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million  net of applicable taxes  consisting of prepayment fees and the write off of deferred financing costs 
as a result of this redemption  we are in the process of providing our bank lenders and the holders of the senior subordinated notes with guarantees by certain of our subsidiaries of our obligations under the credit agreement and the indenture 
we have pledged substantially all of our subsidiaries outstanding stock and assets as collateral for amounts due under the credit agreement 
thus  if we default under the credit agreement  the lenders may take possession of and sell some or substantially all of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow  pay dividends  repurchase outstanding shares of our stock  and sell or transfer our assets 
they also contain restrictive covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
see item business restrictions on our operations 
in  we have purchased the assets of an out of home advertising company in the boston worcester  massachusetts market and television stations kviq and kmtr 
these acquisitions were financed with borrowings under the and credit agreements 
we also have several pending television station acquisitions which we intend to finance with borrowings under the credit agreement 
see item business 
in  we will launch digital centralcasting  a digital broadcasting system which will allow us to consolidate back office functions such as operations  traffic  programming  and accounting for several television stations at one location 
to implement this strategy  we have organized our television stations into the following three regional station groups central new york wixt  wivt  wutr  and wokr  central california kget  kcba  kion  and kcoy  and north coast kfty  kviq  and kmtr 
using digital centralcasting  one station will perform the back office functions for all of the stations in a regional station group 
we believe this strategy will enhance our operational efficiency through economies of scale and the sharing of resources and information among our stations 
in addition  we will significantly enhance the quality of the picture that is seen by our viewers by taking advantage of digital technology 
we plan to invest a portion of the anticipated cost savings in our stations local news programming to increase its quality and quantity  and to increase our stations presence in their communities 
we expect to implement digital centralcasting in the central new york regional station group by july   the central california regional station group in the fourth quarter of  and the north coast regional station group in the first quarter of we believe this strategy will result in significant margin improvement in our television broadcasting segment within approximately two years of implementation 
however  we cannot guarantee that the implementation of digital centralcasting will be achieved in a timely or effective manner  and  accordingly  we can give no assurance as to the timing or extent of the anticipated benefits 
year many computer systems were originally designed to recognize calendar years by the last two digits in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
the issue is not limited to computer systems 
year issues may affect any system or equipment that has an embedded microchip that processes date sensitive information 
state of readiness we are committed to addressing the year issue in a prompt and responsible manner  and have dedicated the resources to do so 
our management has completed an assessment of its automated systems and has implemented a program to complete all steps necessary to resolve identified issues 
our compliance program has several phases  including project management  assessment  testing  and remediation and implementation 
project management we formed a year compliance team in december the team meets generally on a monthly basis to discuss project status  assign tasks  determine priorities  and monitor progress 
the team also reports to senior management on a regular basis 
assessment all of our mission critical software programs have been identified 
this phase is essentially complete 
our primary software vendors and business partners were also assessed during this phase  and vendors business partners who provide mission critical software have been contacted 
in most cases  the vendors business partners that are not already compliant have planned new year compliant releases to be available early in we will continue to monitor and work with vendors and business partners to ensure that appropriate upgrades and or testing is completed 
testing updating and testing of our automated systems is currently underway and we anticipate that testing will be complete by april  upon completion  we will be able to identify any in house developed computer systems that remain non compliant 
remediation and implementation this phase involves obtaining and implementing renovated year compliant software applications provided by our vendors and performing the necessary programming to render in house developed systems year compliant 
this process also involves replacing non compliant hardware 
the remediation and implementation process will continue through costs the total financial impact that year issues will have on our company cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
in fact  in spite of all efforts being made to rectify these issues  the success of our efforts will not be known for sure until the year actually arrives 
however  based on our assessment to date  we do not believe that expenses related to meeting year challenges will exceed  risks related to year issues the year poses certain risks to our company and our operations 
some of these risks are present because we purchase technology and information systems applications from other parties who face year challenges 
other risks are present simply because we transact business with organizations who also face year challenges 
although it is impossible to identify all possible risks that we may face moving into the next millennium  our management has identified the following significant potential risks 
the functions performed by our mission critical software that are primarily at risk from year challenges generally involve the scheduling of advertising and programming in our television broadcasting  radio broadcasting  and sports entertainment segments  the scheduling of advertising in our out of home segment  and the scheduling of events in our sports entertainment segment 
in all of these cases  year challenges could impact our ability to deliver our product with the same efficiency as it does now 
however  we believe these functions can be performed manually or by other alternative means  as necessary  for an indefinite period of time 
in fact  we have had to perform these functions using alternative means in the past due to natural disasters  such as a tornadoes and hurricanes 
in these instances  we were able to recover such that there were no material adverse effects on its operations 
our operations  like those of many other organizations  can be adversely affected by year triggered failures of other companies upon whom we depend for the functioning of our mission critical automated systems 
as described above  we have identified our mission critical vendors and are monitoring their year compliance programs 
contingency plans we have not yet developed specific contingency plans related to year issues  other than those described above 
as we continue the testing phase  and based on future ongoing assessment of the readiness of vendors and service providers  we will develop appropriate contingency plans 
it is possible that certain circumstances may occur for which there are no completely satisfactory contingency plans 
quarterly variations our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due in part to the timing of acquisitions and to seasonal variations in the operations of the television broadcasting  radio broadcasting  and sports entertainment segments 
in particular  our net revenue and operating cash flow historically have been affected positively during the nba basketball season the first  second  and fourth quarters and by increased advertising activity in the second and fourth quarters 
taxes at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expires in the years and  and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
inflation the effects of inflation on our costs generally have been offset by our ability to correspondingly increase our rate structure 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes standards for reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income which refers to unrealized gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are excluded from net income 
adoption of this statement is required in currently  we do not engage in any transactions that would result in the reporting of comprehensive income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because of our minimum use of derivatives  our management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in libor and us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally maintain a portion of our debt as fixed rate in nature either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  which consist of interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts
