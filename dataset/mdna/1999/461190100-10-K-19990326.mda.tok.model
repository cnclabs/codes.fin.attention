item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations introduction the company reported net earnings in of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net earnings of million on revenues of million in  and a net loss of million on revenues of million in as discussed more fully below  the company s performance throughout reflects a generally stronger economy  lower fuel prices at the pump  a continued emphasis on cost reduction  and some improvement in pricing  offset by an increase in driver wages 
a discussion of the impact of the above and other factors on the results of operations in as compared to  and as compared to follows 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings average tractors   total loads s revenue miles millions average revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues increased by million  or in  to million from million in the majority of this increase occurred in brokered revenue which increased million  or  from million in  to million in the acquisition of the assets of ram trans  a flatbed brokerage and logistics company located in denver  colorado  late in the second quarter of  accounted for million of the increase in brokered revenue 
in addition to this acquisition  all of the operating subsidiaries reported significant growth in their brokerage business 
company fleet revenues also increased million  or in  over  while owner operator revenues decreased million  or 
there was virtually no change in the average fleet size in  compared to in the aggregate  revenue miles volume  actually declined 
this decline was attributable to the shorter length of haul from the rrt regional operations and the container movements from emt 
freight demand in  was relatively strong and accounted for the aforementioned growth in the brokered revenues 
these competitive conditions allowed for a increase in average revenue per revenue mile price  which led to the million growth in company fleet revenues 
operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in  purchased transportation and equipment rent increased as a percentage of revenue compared to due to the amount of freight brokered to other carriers 
this increase occurred because of the increase in freight demand and the acquisition of ram trans 
although the average driver s wages increased approximately per mile in  million  compared to  salaries  wages and benefits increased only slightly as a percentage of revenue because of the increase in the average revenue per revenue mile and the relatively smaller portion of the company s total revenue being generated by company operated equipment 
fuel and other operating expenses decreased significantly in  compared to  because the average cost of fuel at the pump declined per gallon 
the benefit of this decrease was partially offset by acquisition expenses  a significant loss of fuel surcharge revenue  and the increased cost of communication expense attributable to the pay phone users surcharge 
depreciation expense declined as a percentage of revenue in  compared to  as a result of the company s continued reliance on non capitalized leases as a means of acquiring its tractors and trailers 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in  primarily as a result of replacing equipment financed with capital lease obligations with equipment financed by operating leases 
interest on bank borrowings were flat in  compared to  due to a slight increase in the average borrowings offset by a reduction in the borrowing rate 
provision for income taxes 
the provision in was approximately million  or of pretax earnings 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate due to the reversal of valuation allowance reserves established in prior years  offset by the impact of certain non deductible expenses 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings loss nm average tractors   total loads s revenue miles millions average revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues increased by million  or in to million from million in the majority of this increase occurred in the owner operator fleet where revenues increased by million or 
brokered revenues also increased million or in over  while company fleet revenues decreased million or 
the increase in revenue miles volume in is primarily attributable to a increase in the average number of owner operator trucks 
the increase in average revenue per revenue mile price is a result of slightly improved competitive conditions which allowed prices to increase modestly during this price increase was minimally affected by fuel surcharge revenues which were relatively the same in  compared to operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in  the mix of company operated versus owner operator equipment shifted to a higher dependence on owner operator equipment  although the company was still primarily dependent on company operated tractors 
approximately of the company s revenue was generated with company operated equipment in  as compared to approximately in the decreased use of the company fleet in resulted in decreases in salaries  wages and benefits  and fixed costs operating taxes and licenses related to ownership or lease of revenue equipment 
conversely  higher use of owner operator equipment resulted in increases in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue 
the company also benefited from lower fuel prices at the pump during the national average price per gallon at the pump declined approximately per gallon 
even with this decrease  the price per gallon at the pump is still approximately per gallon higher than it averaged during the first half of this decade 
relative to  management estimates this price decrease lowered operating expenses by approximately million in the company s insurance expense decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease is primarily due to better accident experience and slightly lower insurance premiums 
approximately one third of the company s insurance expense represented premium payments in and the remaining two thirds of the expenses are comprised of estimates for claims and deductible obligations resulting from accidents and claims 
depreciation expense decreased in as compared to as the company owned approximately fewer tractors in and replaced some capitalized leases with operating leases 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in from in primarily as a result of reduced communications expense and reduced legal and professional fees 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by approximately million in as compared to due to higher average borrowings over the course of the year 
provision for income taxes 
the provision in was approximately million  or of pretax earnings 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate due to the utilization of certain post reorganization tax attributes which had a full valuation allowance  offset by the impact of certain non deductible expenses 
no provision for income taxes was provided in as a result of the operating losses incurred 
a million increase in the net deferred tax assets was offset by a million increase in valuation allowances 
liquidity and capital resources the company used million of cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december   and generated million in the year ended december  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  in  million of cash was generated from operating activities  as compared to million generated in the million  net  used in investing activities in was a result of purchasing equipment at the end of some of its operating leases 
investing activity in generated approximately million as a result of equipment disposals 
borrowings under the line of credit increased by over million primarily to fund principal payments on long term debt  which were million lower than  as a result of more equipment financed under operating leases 
the company s day to day financing is provided by borrowings under its bank credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million term loan with a final maturity of december   and a revolving line of credit  with a maximum limit of million  which expires january  quarterly principal payments of  on the term loan are required until its maturity 
the line of credit includes provisions for the issuance of up to million in standby letters of credit which  as issued  reduce available borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to amounts determined by a formula tied to the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined in the credit facility the borrowing base 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit totaled million at december   and outstanding letters of credit totaled million at that date 
the combination of these two bank credits totaled million and  given the then existing borrowing base  left approximately million of borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit at december  borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit as of february   was approximately million 
the increase in borrowings resulted primarily from the financing of annual license plates and permits for the company operated fleet 
the company s borrowings are typically higher in the first half of the year  and decrease throughout the second half of the year 
on february   the company s bank agreement was amended  resulting in an increase in borrowing capacity with a million capital expenditure line 
this line extends credit to enable the company to purchase certain designated assets in connection with acquisitions 
this addition expands the amount of the credit facility to million 
borrowing capacity as of the end of february   was approximately million  which includes the revolver and capital expenditure lines 
the company is in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in its bank credit facility during the year 
the company is also in compliance with the amended financial covenant test contained on the mortgage loan to one of the operating subsidiaries as of december  the company currently believes that cash generated from operating  financing and investing activities and cash available to it under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s needs during other factors inflation can be expected to have an impact on most of the company s operating costs although the impact of inflation in recent years has been minimal 
changes in market interest rates can be expected to impact the company to the extent that revenue equipment is added and replaced and because the company s lease rates and bank financing are related to market interest rates 
the trucking industry is generally affected by customer business cycles and by seasonality 
revenues are also affected by inclement weather and holidays because revenues are directly related to available working days of shippers 
customers typically reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
the company s revenues tend to follow this pattern and are strongest in the summer months 
generally  the second and third calendar quarters have higher load bookings than the fourth and first calendar quarters 
new accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which establishes standards for reporting information on operating segments 
these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at this time  the company has determined there is no reporting impact on these statements or its disclosures 
year the company has assessed  and continues to assess  the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause our systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly or may cause the system to discontinue functioning altogether 
one of the more significant year issues faced by the company is from its fully integrated dispatch and equipment control systems  which are not year compliant 
as a result  the company is updating and working with the vendors of any products it is using to install new models and or modify all of its applications and computer systems and  in particular  its dispatch and equipment control system to insure that they will be year compliant 
all programs are expected to be fully tested and problems resolved by june  the company does not expect the costs associated with becoming year compliant to be material 
the company has incurred cost of approximately  to date  and expects future costs to be less than  for a total cost of  these cost are being charged to operations as incurred 
management has not developed any contingency plan regarding its dispatch and equipment control systems at this time  but will develop one  if deemed necessary 
as part of the company s comprehensive review  it is continuing to verify the year readiness of third parties vendors and customers with whom the company has material relationships 
at present  the company is not able to determine the effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition in the event the company s material vendors and customers are not year compliant 
the company will continue to monitor the progress of its material vendors and customers and formulate a contingency plan when the company believes a material vendor or customer will not be compliant 
the estimated percentage of completion by june   the date on which the company believes it will complete its year compliance efforts  and the expenses related to the company s year compliance efforts are based on management s best estimates  which are based on assumptions of future events  including the availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no assurances that these results and estimates will be achieved  and the actual results could materially differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the systems or products of third parties on which the company relies will be timely converted or that a failure by a third party  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are impacted by financial risk related to volatility in interest rates related to variable debt instruments 
these debt instruments are non trading in nature and are used to fund the company s day to day operations 
based upon the principal amounts outstanding at december   for those variable rate debt instruments  a market change of basis points in interest rates would correspond to an approximately  impact in interest expense for a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for any change in the borrowings outstanding  which may be reduced through payments or increased through additional borrowings  and does not consider the company s ability to fix the interest rate on one of the three variable rate debt instruments 
this analysis also does not account for any management actions which may be taken in response to these changes 
the company has no material future earnings impact or cash flow expense from changes in interest rates related to its financing of operating equipment as all of the company s equipment financing has fixed rates
