item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eccs is a provider of enterprise storage solutions to protect and ensure access to critical data for server attached  storage area networks san  fibre channel storage  and network attached storage markets 
eccs designs  manufactures  sells and supports high performance  user definable  fault and non fault tolerant storage subsystems to meet a wide range of customer applications  needs and operating systems nt and unix 
these connectivity options enable storage users the flexibility to choose and deploy a particular storage solution to meet their needs  accommodating both centralized to distributed storage environments 
eccs products are sold globally through oems  vars and system integrators and domestically on a direct basis 
eccs customers cross all industries  including large database companies or those that use databases  financial enterprises  retail  non profit organizations  internet service providers  imaging users  telecommunications and the federal government 
the company s revenues are generated from three primary sources i revenues derived from sales of mass storage enhancement products  which include sales of all eccs mass storage enhancement products  including the synchronix family of products  and sales of certain third party component products that are incorporated into such mass storage enhancement systems  ii revenues generated by the company as a var which include the company s sales to at t business units for non storage related products  and iii revenues derived from services and other revenue which include professional services and maintenance contracts 
the company believes that revenues generated by the company as a var  which include sales to at t business units of non storage related products  will be minimal in the future 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales derived from each of the product groupings the company uses to analyze sales and revenue year ended december  eccs mass storage enhancement products including all eccs proprietary products and certain third party component products value added resales services and other revenues the year to year percentage increases in sales by the company of is proprietary systems  as well as the year to year percentage decreases in sales by the company in its capacity as a var are due  primarily  to the company s repositioning as a provider of its own proprietary mass storage enhancement systems including storage subsystems 
most of the company s proprietary products are manufactured under contract by unisys pursuant to the company s specifications 
in accordance with the company s instructions  unisys ships the finished product directly to the company s customers 
the company believes that by outsourcing certain manufacturing requirements  the company benefits from the greater purchasing power of the manufacturers  reduction of inventory carrying costs and the avoidance of certain investments in plant  property and equipment 
in february  unisys  the primary outside manufacturer for the synchronix system  notified the company that unisys was closing its winnipeg computer storage systems manufacturing plant by july  and accordingly the manufacturing services agreement will be terminated at that time 
the company plans to locate another third party manufacturer and or manufacture such systems in house 
although the company anticipates that it has sufficient facilities and expertise to manufacture the synchronix and synchronix systems in house  there can be no assurance that material problems will not arise in the future that could materially adversely effect the company s results of operations 
in february  the company received iso certification 
such certification reflects uniform  industry wide standards of quality control for manufacturing data storage products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to meet the industry accepted standards necessary to maintain iso certification 
product sales revenue is generally recognized upon product shipment 
periodically  however  revenue is recognized for product which is being held at the customer s request 
revenue is only recognized on such product when all risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the company has no specific performance obligations remaining 
the company s cost of revenues relating to product sales consists primarily of the costs of purchased material  direct labor and related overhead expenses  and amortization of capitalized software 
an increase in proprietary product sales combined with the anticipated continued reduction in the sale of third party product  which typically carries lower margins  is expected to lower cost of revenues as a percentage of sales 
costs of revenues related to services are comprised primarily of direct labor and related overhead expenses 
the company s oem sales to date have been primarily to unisys and tandem 
in march  the company commenced sales of products to tandem for resale 
on march   the company announced that it had signed a corporate purchasing agreement with tandem pursuant to which tandem has the ability to purchase synchronix from the company and resell synchronix under a private label with tandem s own systems 
the company s sales to tandem will be made by purchase order 
therefore  the company has no long term commitments from tandem and tandem generally may cancel orders upon appropriate written notice to the company 
as a result of compaq s acquisition of digital  whose products included a similar storage system to that of eccs  compaq decided to focus its marketing efforts on its own products in lieu of outsourced products 
the company was informed that tandem intends to discontinue the marketing of the company s product after the second quarter of accordingly  the company notified tandem that it would terminate the contract effective february   which  pursuant to the reseller agreement  would give tandem an addional ninety days to purchase product from the company 
there can be no assurance that orders from tandem will continue at their historic levels or that the company will be able to obtain any new orders from tandem 
the profitability of any particular quarter is significantly affected by the relative sales levels of each of the company s primary sales channels oem  federal and commercial 
gross margins on products shipped to commercial customers generally provide higher margins  followed by oem and federal 
to the extent that the company is successful in increasing its sales of synchronix and synchronection to the commercial market directly and through oem arrangements  the company believes gross margins should improve accordingly 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of salaries  commissions and travel costs for sales and marketing personnel  trade shows and expenses associated with the company s management  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
the company anticipates that sg a spending levels will decrease as a percentage of sales to the extent sales to oems increase as a percentage of sales 
sales to oems typically absorb much of the administrative burden otherwise incurred by the company 
since  the company has increased its research and development activity in connection with the development of synchronix and synchronection 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to engineers and programmers 
research and development expenses are anticipated to be a substantial part of the company s cost structure in the near future to enable the company to update and expand upon its existing product offerings 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which may be beyond the company s control

research and development projects for which the company expects to devote resources in the near future relate to i a next generation of the synchronix family of products  ii the development of a distributed file system storage architecture  iii new interface connectivities  and iv customized oem products 
the company believes that the anticipated increase in its research and development investment could adversely affect earnings in the first six months of  however  such adverse impact  if any  may be offset in part by the company s decision to discontinue the development of its new technology center 
in addition  in the company discontinued its efforts to develop a fibre controller and a controller design that incorporates tandem s server net technology 
as a result  the company incurred a one time charge in of  net interest expense net interest income for was  while net interest expense was in such fluctuation was due principally to higher cash balances resulting from cash generated by the company s follow on public offering in and a reduction in the borrowings against the company s accounts receivable line of credit

in february  the company s board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to  for research and new product development  including the development of a distributed file system storage architecture and other significant enhancements to the current synchronix product family 
subsequently  on november  the board of directors approved resolutions to discontinue expenditures related to the company s technology center in san jose  california  however  research and new product development will continue at the company s discretion 
on october   the board of directors unanimously voted in favor of offering to all employees who were previously granted stock options an opportunity to exchange such options for new stock options to purchase shares of common stock of the company  at an exercise price equal to per share the new options  the fair market value of the company s common stock on such date 
the new options are exercisable to the extent of one half on each of the first and second anniversary of the date of grant 
the company offered the new options in order to pursue its commitment to retain key employees  particularly in light of the highly competitive labor market for technical personnel 
on november   the company formally offered its employees the option to exchange all outstanding options for the new options pursuant to the terms of the stock plan 
the number of outstanding options which were exchanged for new options was  impact of the year general computer systems were originally designed to recognize calendar years by the last two digits in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code field will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
any of eccs computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  in the coming year  the computerized systems including both information and non information technology systems and applications used by eccs will need to be reviewed  evaluated and  if and where necessary  modified or replaced to ensure that all financial  information and operating systems are year compliant 
state of readiness eccs has formed an internal task force comprised of representatives of its various relevant departments to address year compliance matters 
the task force has undertaken a preliminary review of internal and external areas that are likely to be affected by year compliance matters and has classified the various areas as mission critical  important or non critical non important 
with respect to internal matters  eccs has completed a review of its hardware and software to determine whether its business related applications including applications relating to distribution  finance  inventories  operations  products  purchasing and sales marketing will be year compliant 
in addition  in  programs designed to identify year problems associated with dates embedded in certain business related files were created and executed to identify any year compliance issues 
the testing unearthed a few year problems  all of which have been addressed and retested for year readiness 
while the results of the tests are still being analyzed  relatively few year problems were identified 
there can be no assurance  however  that such testing has detected  or will detect  all compliance issues related to the year problem 
with respect to external matters  eccs has distributed questionnaires and requests for certification to its mission critical vendors and in the process of obtaining and reviewing the responses thereto 
the questionnaires have requested information concerning embedded technologies of such vendors  the hardware and software applications used by such vendors and the year compliance efforts of such vendors relating thereto 
estimated year compliance costs through december   eccs has incurred approximately  in costs excluding in house labor and hardware  which includes installation of the erp system in  in connection with year compliance matters 
eccs estimates that it will expend approximately on additional hardware  software and other items related to the year compliance matters 
risks relating to year compliance matters eccs goal to become year compliance with respect to internal matters during calendar year although eccs has begun and is undertaking testing of its internal business related hardware and software applications  there can be no assurances that such testing will detect all applications that may be affected by year compliance problems 
with respect to external matters  due to the multi dependent and interdependent issues raised by year compliance  including many factors beyond its control  eccs may face the possibility that one or more of its mission critical vendors  such as its utilities  telephone carriers or equipment manufacturers  may not be year compliance on a timely basis 
because of the unique nature of such vendors  alternate providers may not be available 
contingency planning eccs has begun the process of assessing contingency plans that might be available in the event of either internal or external year compliance problems 
to this end  eccs various internal departments have begun to prepare assessments of potential contingency alternatives 
the task force will undertake a review of these assessments in respect of application of contingency plans on a department by department basis and on a company wide basis 
eccs intends to complete its contingency planning in respect to year compliance during the third quarter of calendar year the company believes that its existing available cash  credit facilities and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations  will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations for at least the next months 
the company s operating results are affected by seasonal factors  particularly the spending fluctuations of its largest customers including unisys  tandem and the federal government 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain of the company s costs  a decline in net sales in any fiscal quarter typically results in lower profitability in that quarter 
the company does not expect such spending fluctuations to be altered in the future 
a significant reduction in orders from any of the company s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s largest customers will continue to place orders with the company or that orders of its customers will continue at their previous levels
