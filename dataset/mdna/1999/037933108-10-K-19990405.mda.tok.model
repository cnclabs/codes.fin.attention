item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services including home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy  home medical equipment and other services 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through its branch locations 
management measures operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each branch as an operating segment 
all the branches offer the same services  except that infusion services are not offered in all the geographic markets in which the company operates 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment 
background 
in june  apria announced that it had retained an investment banking firm as its financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  including the possible sale  merger or recapitalization of apria 
during the first quarter of  apria entered into a recapitalization agreement  however  the agreement was terminated by mutual consent of the parties on april  this process and resulting uncertainties are believed to have adversely affected apria s financial results 
by may  apria s active exploration of strategic alternatives was terminated as a result of hiring a new chief executive officer and other key management executives and the reconfiguration of the board of directors 
in july  after an evaluation of the business  apria s new management team announced its strategic plan  or reorganization  to improve the company s performance 
the key elements of the reorganization are no change would be made to the fundamental nature of the business  apria would withdraw from unprofitable components of the business  which would include exiting the infusion therapy business in certain geographic areas  a comprehensive cost reduction and capital conservation program would be instituted  apria would pursue expansion through internal growth and acquisitions  and the debt and capital structure would be reexamined 
significant actions taken by apria s new management team since it announced the reorganization include a change in management s collection policy and a refinement of the accounts receivable collectibility estimation methodologies as described below  the sale of the california component of the infusion therapy business the infusion sale  the exit of the infusion therapy business in texas  louisiana  west virginia  western pennsylvania and downstate new york and the consolidation or closure of certain small branch locations throughout the united states collectively  the exited businesses 
other significant actions include the termination of plans to proceed with the capital intensive implementation of an enterprise resource planning system  a significant reduction of corporate and regional labor and general administrative costs and the development of a comprehensive plan to capture cost savings in the areas of purchasing  distribution and inventory management 
results of operations net revenues 
substantially all of apria s revenues are reimbursed by third party payors  including medicare  medicaid and managed care organizations  representing approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required in recording net revenues 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated  and the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 
in june of  apria determined that its strategy to focus on increasing managed care market share had negatively impacted its financial performance  particularly for infusion therapy  because of significant managed care price compression  difficulties in billing and collecting from managed care organizations and related losses of traditional referral business 
in response to these conditions  management reevaluated its strategies and began efforts to exit certain managed care contracts not meeting minimum profitability thresholds  as well as certain lower margin service lines and began to reemphasize traditional referral based business from sources such as physicians  hospitals  medical groups and home health agencies 
service lines targeted for exit in included medical supplies  women s health and nursing management  which represented annual revenues of approximately million 
some portion of the medical supply and nursing business is expected to continue due to core service line customer requirements 
through the end of  apria had exited contracted business representing approximately million in annual revenues 
the contract review process continued into resulting in the termination of contracts totaling approximately million in annual revenues 
a consequence of the initiatives to exit certain service lines and to exit certain low margin managed care contracts was the loss of related business which apria would have preferred to retain 
in addition to the specific quantifiable reductions to revenue mentioned herein  revenues were adversely impacted by various other factors 
in mid apria began a process to explore the feasibility of entering into a transaction such as a sale  merger or recapitalization 
apria entered into an agreement for a recapitalization transaction during the first quarter of which was subsequently terminated 
the entire process created an environment of uncertainty  both within apria and with its customers and other business partners 
during this same period there were a number of changes in senior management and to the board of directors  which added to the distraction and raised more uncertainty 
these issues led apria to be characterized in a very negative light in various newspapers and trade journals 
also  during this period of turmoil  apria found it very difficult to attract and retain quality sales personnel which left many geographic sales territories lacking sufficient coverage to compete effectively 
all of these factors have adversely impacted revenues  but attributing dollar amounts to each would not be feasible 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in millions respiratory therapy infusion therapy home medical equipment other total net revenues   respiratory therapy 
the decrease in respiratory revenues in compared to is almost entirely due to the reduction of medicare reimbursement rates pursuant to the provisions of the balanced budget act of effective january   the medicare reimbursement rates for home oxygen therapy and respiratory drugs were reduced by and  respectively 
the estimated decrease in revenues and operating income resulting from these reimbursement reductions is approximately million 
a further reimbursement reduction of on home oxygen therapy became effective on january   which is estimated to reduce revenues and operating income by approximately million 
also effective january   was a freeze on consumer price index based increases until the increase in respiratory therapy revenues in over is due to apria s concerted effort in early to refocus on respiratory therapy and to increase the number of territories covering this higher margin traditional business 
infusion therapy 
the decrease in infusion therapy revenues in is primarily due to the termination of unprofitable contracts and formidable competition at the local and national levels 
also impacting infusion therapy revenues was the decision to sell exit the infusion business in certain geographic markets 
the decision was made at the end of the third quarter and the transition out of the business in substantially all of the selected areas took place in the fourth quarter 
the impact on revenues during the transition period was a reduction of approximately million 
the annual revenues represented by these infusion locations is approximately million 
the decrease in infusion revenues in as compared to reflects the early effects of the contract termination process  the increased competition and the company s focus on the respiratory business 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues decreased significantly in as compared to the primary causes were due to discontinuing the medical supply  women s health and nursing management service lines and terminating unprofitable contracts 
further  the termination of contracts or loss of business in the respiratory and infusion therapy lines resulted in the loss of collateral business within the home medical equipment other line 
home medical equipment other revenues remained flat from to this represents growth in the early part of due to apria s emphasis on obtaining managed care business as offset by the loss of medical supply and nursing revenues in the latter part of the freeze on consumer price index based medicare reimbursement increases discussed above is applicable to certain patient service equipment items within apria s home medical equipment line 
revenue adjustments 
due to the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services and or from certain payors  adjustments to billed amounts are fairly common and are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or upon account review 
examples of such revenue adjustments include subsequent changes to estimated revenue amounts or denials for services not covered due to changes in the patient s coverage  failure subsequent to service delivery to obtain written confirmation of authorization or other necessary documentation  and differences in contract prices due to complex contract terms or a biller s lack of familiarity with a contract or payor 
further  increases in apria s average collection periods have increased the level of unidentified revenue adjustments accumulating in accounts receivable 
these problems originated during the system conversions and branch consolidations effected in and the related disruptions and employee turnover impeded normal processing and account reviews and resulted in a high rate of billing problems 
although management has taken a number of steps to address the billing and collection problems  the high levels of revenue adjustments have persisted 
due to the existence of unidentified revenue adjustments in accounts receivable  management estimates and records an allowance for such adjustments 
in  and  management recorded adjustments to reduce revenues and accounts receivable by million  million and million  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
gross profit 
gross margins were in  in and in despite the decrease in revenues due to the medicare reimbursement rate reductions  apria s gross margin improved in the improvement in versus is attributable to a number of factors  the most significant of which is the elimination of contracts not meeting profitability standards 
mitigating the improvement were certain charges recorded during the third quarter reorganization including million to settle certain procurement contracts  million to provide for estimated losses in the company s oxygen cylinders and million to write off operational assets in conjunction with exiting certain portions of the infusion business 
as part of the new management team s strategy  a consulting firm was engaged to help identify opportunities for operational improvement and cost savings in the functional areas of purchasing and supply management  inventory management and vehicle fleet and delivery management 
a plan was adopted and implementation began in early included in the plan are standardization initiatives and optimal operating models 
the deterioration in the gross margin in as compared to was due  in part  to the downward pressure of managed care pricing on gross margins 
also contributing to the decrease were charges of million and million recorded in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the second quarter charge of million was estimated based on the preliminary results of asset verification and physical inventory procedures performed in the second quarter 
the adjustment was sufficient to cover actual write offs resulting from the third quarter completion of the company s asset verification and physical inventory procedures 
the charge was primarily due to untimely inventory relief processes that were among the residual effects of the and system conversions and related high employee turnover 
the fourth quarter charge of million was an adjustment for additional inventory shortages incurred since the completion of the second and third quarter asset verifications 
because of the inventory relief problem  management performed supplemental physical inventory procedures at a sampling of branches in the fourth quarter 
the procedure indicated continuing inventory and patient service equipment shortages  therefore management estimated and recorded an increase to the related reserves 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit in was an increase in patient service equipment depreciation of million over due to higher levels of asset purchases in and provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
in august  management reviewed the historic performance and collectibility of apria s accounts receivable portfolio 
management considered the continued high level of bad debt write offs and reviewed its existing policies and procedures for estimating the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
in response  management decided to change the collection policy and is formally shifting the focus of the collection function to the more current balances and is assigning the older accounts to outside collection agencies 
management believes this concentration on more current balances will limit the amount of receivables that age 
consequently  the accounts that do age will undoubtedly be receivables where collection will be difficult 
with this change in collection policy  management developed a new estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts by increasing the allowance related to balances over days outstanding 
accordingly  management recorded an adjustment in the third quarter of to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
the provision includes million for specific uncollectible accounts and charges totaling million to increase the allowance for accounts associated with the infusion sale and the exited businesses 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts included adjustments of million and million recorded in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the second quarter adjustment was necessary because improvement in the aging of accounts receivable and in collection timing and rates did not meet expectations 
management had expected the impact of the field information system conversions and high turnover among billing and collection personnel to have substantially reversed by the middle of however  the dollar amount and percentage of accounts aged over days at may  remained comparable to the december  amount and days sales outstanding had decreased by only five days 
additionally  apria had just changed its business strategy to review its managed care contracts and exit those not meeting profitability standards and to exit unprofitable service lines such as supplies and nursing that were attractive to many managed care customers 
these strategies put apria s relationship with certain of its managed care customers in jeopardy  which when coupled with the company s poor experience in collecting receivables with managed care payors  heightened management s concerns 
due to the managed care issues and the failure to realize the expected increases in collections and improvement in the aging  management increased its allowance estimate for accounts aged over days to provide for write offs of older accounts expected to be taken in the ensuing months 
the adjustment also provided for an increased allowance estimate for accounts aged less than days  necessitated by billing and collection difficulties that continued into early the fourth quarter adjustment resulted primarily from refinements to apria s allowance estimation procedures made in conjunction with management s year end analysis of accounts receivable 
specifically  based on tests of subsequent realization and review of patient billing files at selected billing locations  further increases were made to the percentages applied to apria s accounts receivable aging to estimate allowance amounts 
in addition  due to an increasing tendency for certain managed care payors to accumulate significant amounts of patient balances  a specific review and allowance estimation was performed for payors with large aggregate patient balances 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and for   and  respectively 
the increase in selling  distribution and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue from to is directly attributable to the lower revenue base in actual expenses for decreased million from the previous year 
in response to the reduction in revenues  management has taken steps to reduce costs  the most significant of which was a reduction in the company s labor force which commenced in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout from september  to december   apria reduced its full time equivalent employees by approximately  the majority of the labor reductions made in resulted from the third quarter reorganization of apria s field operations into geographic regions previously  currently and through the elimination of positions at the company s corporate headquarters 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses include the following reorganization charges in the third quarter of million loss on the infusion sale  million to record certain costs associated with the exited businesses  million in severance  stay bonuses and other employee costs and million in lease liability on vacant facilities due to facility consolidation activities 
other charges recorded in the third quarter of include additional amounts for legal fees and settlements 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses for increased million over the increase was due  in part  to increased staffing levels in those functional areas where the company had been experiencing operational difficulties 
third and fourth quarter terminations of approximately employees resulted in severance and related excise tax charges totaling million 
charges of million were also recorded in in connection with exiting certain business lines and closing facilities 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in is due to the write off of impaired goodwill of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the resulting reduction in amortization expense was offset slightly by a reduction in the amortization period for infusion related goodwill from years to years 
impairment of intangible assets 
in  the deterioration in the infusion therapy industry and apria s decision to withdraw from the infusion business in certain geographic markets served as indicators of potential intangible asset impairment 
other indicators of potential impairment identified by management include  among other issues  the company s depressed common stock price  failure to meet its already lowered financial expectations  the threat of continued medicare reimbursement reductions  government investigations against the company  slower than expected progress in improving its revenue management process  and reported financial difficulties within major managed care organizations with which the company does business  resulting in collection difficulties 
management conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of the company s recorded intangible assets 
management considered current and anticipated industry conditions  recent changes in its business strategies  and current and anticipated operating results 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment charge of milllion which was recorded in the third quarter of the charge includes a write off of million in intangible assets associated with the exit of the infusion business in certain areas 
certain conditions  including apria s failure to meet projections and expectations  declining gross margins  recurring operating losses  significant downward adjustment to the company s projections for and a depressed common stock value  were identified by management as indicators of potential intangible asset impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  management conducted an evaluation of the carrying value and amortization periods of recorded intangible assets 
management considered current and anticipated industry conditions  recent changes in its business strategies and current and anticipated operating results 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment charge of million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the impairment evaluation  management reduced the amortization period for goodwill related to acquired infusion therapy businesses from years to years 
the remaining infusion related goodwill is being amortized over the years remaining assuming a year life from date of acquisition 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets were grouped at the branch level  which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent 
a branch location was deemed to be impaired if the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets and goodwill at the branch 
in estimating future cash flows  management used its best estimates of anticipated operating results over the remaining useful life of the assets where  in the case of the computation  the useful life is the amortization period before giving effect to the reduction in the infusion business goodwill from to years 
for those branches identified as impaired  the amount of impairment was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived assets and goodwill to the estimated fair value for each branch 
fair value was estimated using a valuation technique based on the present value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets and internally developed software 
one of the actions taken in as a result of management s new strategic direction was the termination of the project to implement an enterprise resource planning erp system 
accordingly  apria wrote off related software and other capitalized costs of million in the third quarter of as part of the decision to terminate the erp project  management evaluated its current systems to determine their long term viability in the context of apria s new overall strategic direction 
it was determined that apria was at some risk in continuing to run the infusion billing system on its current platform which is no longer supported by the computer industry 
to mitigate the risk  apria is currently converting the infusion system to the ibm as operating platform on which the respiratory home medical equipment system currently operates 
also  apria is now proceeding with a number of enhancements to the systems which rendered certain previously developed modules obsolete 
further  pharmacy and branch consolidations and closures rendered a variety of computer equipment obsolete 
due to its age and technological obsolescence  it was deemed to have no future value 
as a result of these actions  apria recorded an impairment charge of million at september  apria also recognized additional asset impairments during of million in conjunction with the exited businesses and million related to other facility closures and consolidations 
during  management reevaluated its current information systems in light of year risks and ongoing operational difficulties and concluded that significant additional costs would be necessary to adequately correct system deficiencies and improve functionality 
accordingly  the decision was made to replace apria s systems  including internally developed software  with a large scale  fully integrated enterprise resource planning system 
a two year development and implementation plan was approved by the board of directors in december the project was subsequently terminated as discussed above 
in light of the evaluation and decisions during  management reviewed the carrying value of the capitalized software and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the charge included a million reduction to the carrying value of apria s branch information system acis program development costs  an million write off of costs associated with acis implementation and conversion  and a million write off of costs of a specialized telecommunications software program developed for apriadirect  a clinical program that was discontinued in december in connection with management s evaluation of apria s internally developed software  management also conducted a review of the company s computer hardware  including telecommunications equipment 
equipment with a carrying value of million was identified as functionally obsolete or no longer in use and was written off in interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in long term debt levels  although lower than in  remained constant throughout until november  when a million payment was made as a requirement of the amended and restated credit agreement 
however  apria s effective interest rate increased steadily over  as the company did not meet the required levels of funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  the financial ratio governing the applicable interest rate margin available to the company 
apria s cash balances have increased from million at december  to million at december  the interest income from the accumulated cash reserves has helped to mitigate the impact of higher effective interest rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense for was million  which is primarily state taxes payable on a basis other than  or in addition to  taxable income 
at december   apria had net operating carryforwards nols for federal income taxes of approximately million  expiring in varying amounts in the years through in evaluating the realizability of the nols at december   various positive and negative factors pertaining to the existence of sufficient projected taxable income within the carryforward period were considered 
management believes that its strategies may result in sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period to utilize apria s nols 
however  the achievement of future taxable income is dependent upon future events and economic  regulatory and other factors largely out of management s control 
therefore  such future taxable income is not assured 
additionally  in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  management also considered the significant negative factors existing at december   including apria s recent historical financial and tax losses make it difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not needed  apria has  in recent years  been unable to meet its operating plans  and while management has implemented new strategies to achieve profitability and reported a profit in the fourth quarter of  there can be no assurances that operating profits will continue in any future period or that management will be successful in implementing all its strategies  including its growth plans 
in considering the positive and negative factors at this time  management concluded that it is more likely than not that apria will be unable to utilize the nols except for future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  and consequently  has recorded a valuation allowance of million at december  income tax expense for amounted to million and included million to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to recurring tax losses and lower estimates of future taxable income 
the remaining amount of income tax expense includes estimated state taxes payable based on factors other than income  estimated settlement amounts for in progress state tax audits  foreign taxes related to the sale in of apria s equity interest in a united kingdom based company and the settlement amount paid on an examination of apria s federal tax returns for through certain of these tax expense items resulted in increases to deferred tax assets for which no benefit was recorded in due to offsetting increases to the valuation allowance 
income tax expense for amounted to million and represented of income before taxes 
the deductibility in of certain accruals and merger related reserves established in resulted in a tax loss  an increase in refundable taxes due to a carryback of a portion of the tax loss  and a decrease in net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flow 
in apria generated million in operating cash flow compared to million generated in and cash used in operating activities of million in the primary reason for the improvement in operating cash flow was the decrease in accounts receivable as compared to a significant increase in also contributing to the increase in operating cash flow was a reduction in net purchases of patient service equipment over levels and the fact that less cash was used in due to the timing of payments against accounts payable and payroll and related costs 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by million during the decrease is attributable to the decline in net revenues  a high level of bad debt write offs and revenue adjustments and cash collections in excess of trailing net revenues 
during  apria wrote off accounts receivable totaling million 
cash posted to accounts receivable was of trailing net revenues for background 
apria s accounts receivable problems originated with the abbey homedco merger 
the merger resulted in a restructuring plan that included a very rapid consolidation of operating locations and the conversion of all locations to standardized information systems 
during the last six months of  over  employees were terminated and over branch locations were closed or consolidated with other branches 
beginning with the consummation of the merger  each branch information system was first converted to the predominant system in place within its region 
conversion of the branches to the standard  company wide systems then occurred on a region by region basis 
because of the conversion to interim systems prior to final conversion  locations representing approximately of apria s net revenues underwent conversion 
ultimately  a total of system conversions were completed  were completed during and during the first three quarters of the disruptions caused by the branch consolidations and systems conversions had a major impact on the functions of order taking  product delivery  billing and collections 
existing employees challenged with learning new systems and high turnover during this period created serious training issues 
further  familiarity with the complex and payor specific billing requirements is critical to ensure proper and timely billing and collections 
much of this expertise was lost due to the high turnover among billing and collection personnel 
improvement actions 
in response to these problems and the resulting high rates of bad debt write offs and revenue adjustments  management instituted a number of measures 
in  such measures included the implementation of a collection incentive program with special emphasis on older accounts  the hiring of additional management level billing and collection personnel and systems reinforcement training 
in  apria instituted a process review of the field information systems to identify opportunities to improve billing processing  timeliness and accuracy 
management also validated and corrected system pricing files and implemented billing center audits to assess compliance with billing practices and procedures 
during the first quarter of  management reorganized its field operations to create a separate revenue management organization which encompasses the functions of order taking  patient qualification  documentation coordination  timely filing and prompt follow up 
the revenue management organization reports directly to corporate headquarters and specifically to a newly created executive vice president position 
the new organization structure was intended to facilitate improved communications and accountability 
in conjunction with the reorganization  processes and procedures were reviewed to identify additional opportunities for improvement 
as a result  additional personnel were placed in quality assurance positions to help ensure that products and services were more accurately and timely billed and responsibilities were consolidated to allow specifically qualified personnel to support  direct and train the revenue management staff 
task forces were formed to visit the billing centers to ensure compliance with policies and standard procedures 
also  software enhancements to simplify the order intake process were introduced 
allowance evaluation 
accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments and further netted by an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect accounts receivable in the financial statements at net realizable value 
bad debt and revenue adjustment allowances are analyzed on a combined basis 
management uses actual write off classifications in conjunction with historical experience and account reviews to determine the appropriate categorization of revenue adjustments and bad debts  both reserved and expensed 
apria s methodology for estimating allowances for uncollectible accounts and providing for the related revenue adjustments and bad debt expense involves an extensive  balanced evaluation of operating statistics  historical realization data and accounts receivable aging trends 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as system conversions  facility consolidations  business combinations  medicare carrier conditions and extent of contracted business 
finally  specific reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed 
management periodically refines the analysis and allowance estimation process to consider any changes in related policies and procedures such as the recent change in focus to collecting the more current accounts 
accordingly  management adjusts the combined allowance to reflect its best estimate of the allowance required at each reporting date 
see results of operations revenue adjustments and provision for doubtful accounts 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and milion at december  and  respectively 
there is a delay of approximately a day or two  up to several weeks or more in some cases  between the date of service and billing due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
such documentation would include internal records of proof of service and written authorizations from physicians and other referral sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
long term debt 
apria s credit agreement with a syndicate of banks was amended and restated in november of and further amended in january and february of the november amendment required a million permanent repayment of the loan upon execution 
the remaining indebtedness under the credit agreement was restructured into a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of august  the amended and restated agreement currently requires that apria issue not less than million of senior subordinated convertible debentures or senior subordinated notes by april   the net proceeds of which must be applied to the term loan 
the amended and restated credit agreement allows apria to make acquisitions under an acquisition basket provision of up to million  subject to certain restrictions  that may be increased given certain levels of financial performance by apria 
in  the acquisition limit is subject to dollar for dollar reduction by the amount of any unusual cash expenses as defined by the agreement incurred and paid in term loan principal payments are payable quarterly  in varying amounts  commencing on march  and continuing through june  further  between the effective date of the november amendment and the earlier of april  or the issuance date of the debentures or notes  apria is subject to prepayment requirements on the term loan based on excess cash flow as defined by the agreement 
the resulting prepayments of million reduced the required amount of the quarterly term loan payment that was due march  to zero  and no additional prepayments based on excess cash flow are required 
the amended and restated credit agreement permits apria to elect one of two variable rate interest options at the time an advance is made 
the first option is a rate expressed as plus the higher of the federal funds rate plus per annum or the bank of america reference rate 
the second option is a rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an additional increment of per annum 
the agreement requires payment of commitment fees of on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of apria s assets and the agreement also imposes numerous restrictions  including  but not limited to  covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  mergers  acquisitions and investments  and restrictions on cash dividends  loans and other distributions 
further  the agreement requires that apria maintain at least million in its depository accounts until the issuance of the senior subordinated convertible debentures or senior subordinated notes 
at december   total borrowings under the credit agreement totaled million  none of which were advanced from the revolving credit facility 
at december   outstanding letters of credit totaled million and credit available under the revolving credit facility was million subject to the restriction under the indenture discussed below 
under the indenture governing apria s million senior subordinated notes due november   apria s ability to incur indebtedness becomes restricted at times when the company s fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than to charges taken in the second and fourth quarters of and in the third quarter of resulted in the fixed charge coverage ratio being less than to this condition is expected to continue at least through the third quarter of apria has changed its cash management procedures to avoid the need to incur indebtedness that would otherwise require a modification of the terms of the indenture and has accumulated a balance in its money market account of million at march other balance sheet changes 
the decrease in accrued payroll and related taxes and benefits at december   compared to december  is due to a decrease of three days in the accrual of payroll related costs and the reduced workforce 
at december   other assets was primarily comprised of payments for businesses acquired late in the year 
the payments were then allocated to the various underlying acquired assets in early dispositions and business combinations 
as part of apria s new strategic direction  management performed an extensive profitability study to identify service lines and or geographic markets as potential candidates for exit 
most significant of the decisions arising from the study was the decision to withdraw from the infusion business in california  texas  louisiana  west virginia  western pennsylvania and downstate new york 
shortly after apria announced its plans to exit the infusion line in these geographic markets  a buyer emerged for the california locations 
crescent healthcare  inc purchased substantially all the assets and business  excluding accounts receivable  of the california infusion locations 
apria recorded a million loss on the sale in the third quarter of in the other locations where apria decided to exit the infusion business  management worked with its business partners to modify contracts and transfer patients to other providers 
this transition was substantially complete by the end of the operations of these infusion locations had revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross profits were million  million and million  respectively  for the same periods 
apria periodically makes acquisitions of complementary businesses in specific geographic markets 
cash paid for acquisitions that closed during totaled million 
purchase commitments 
on september   apria entered into a five year agreement  which was subsequently amended in june  to purchase medical supplies totaling million with minimum annual purchases ranging from million in the first year to million in the third through fifth years 
failure to purchase at least of the annual commitment would result in a penalty of of the difference between the annual commitment and the actual purchases  beginning with the month period ended august  in late  management made the strategic decision to exit the low margin medical supply business and has been working with the vendor to restructure the agreement 
in the interim  the company continues to purchase needed medical supplies from this vendor  subject to the pricing established under the old agreement 
the company failed to meet the minimum purchase commitment for the month period ended august   and  consequently  incurred a liability for penalties of million on the purchase shortfall 
year compliance 
as the year approaches  an issue impacting all companies has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value 
in brief  many existing application programs in the marketplace were designed to accommodate a two digit date position which represents the year eg  is stored on the system and represents the year 
consequently  the year could be the maximum date value that systems would be able to accurately process 
internal operating systems 
beginning in late  apria conducted a comprehensive review of its operating and field information systems  including an assessment of the nature and potential extent of the impact of the year issue 
as a result  apria began the modification process of its software in order for its computer systems to function properly in the year and thereafter 
apria utilized internal resources to reprogram and test the software for the necessary year modifications 
apria s systems also underwent two external assessments of the year issue and received a low risk rating 
the modification and testing were completed on schedule and management now considers its operating and field information systems year compliant 
to further ensure a smooth transition into the year  management will  among other measures  suspend software updates between november and january and form a special team to address any related problems that may arise 
apria has not developed a formal contingency plan in the event that the system modifications prove to be inadequate 
such inadequacies could result in system failure or miscalculations 
this would cause disruptions to normal business processes including  among other things  the temporary inability to process transactions and generate billings 
if such a disruption continued for an extended period  it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  cash flow and financial condition of apria 
apria is currently in the process of assessing and addressing any potential issues with its ancillary software packages that perform less critical functions and any other electronic mechanisms that could have date sensitive microprocessors 
external risks 
apria depends on electronic interfaces with many of its business partners to conduct many of its day to day functions 
such functions include payments to and from suppliers and payors  transfer of funds between apria s banks  and electronic billing and supply ordering 
apria has been in contact with its more critical business partners to obtain assurance of their year readiness and is currently in the process of scheduling live tests with the regional medicare carriers responsible for processing approximately one fourth of apria s reimbursements 
as a contingency  in the event of failure on the part of an external agent  the exchange of data and payments can continue via paper documents and more traditional methods 
further  apria has revised contracts with certain of its managed care payors to include remedies should the payor fail to reimburse the company on a timely basis due to their own year problems 
another area of potential risk is with certain patient service equipment items that have microprocessors with date functionality that could malfunction in the year although apria has found the majority of such microprocessors include duration time clocks and not date time clocks  management has initiated formal communications with its suppliers to obtain assurance that the equipment they supply is year compliant 
to date  apria has received year compliance certification letters from substantially all of its primary vendors and approximately of the entire set of vendors from which it requested such assurance 
if apria is unable to resolve all its year issues with external agents  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
costs 
apria does not believe the costs of its year remediation efforts are material 
to date  such costs have been expensed as incurred 
management s expectations about year related costs yet to be incurred are subject to various uncertainties that could cause the actual costs to differ materially from those expectations 
such uncertainties include the adequacy of the modifications made to apria s operating and field information systems  the success of the company in identifying and resolving any problems with its ancillary systems or electronic mechanisms and the year readiness of apria s business partners

apria s management believes that cash provided by operations together with cash invested in its money market account will be sufficient to finance its current operations for at least the next year or until the borrowing restriction described above is eliminated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk apria currently utilizes no material derivative financial instruments which expose the company to significant market risk 
however  interest rate changes may affect the cash flow  earnings  and the fair value of its term debt due to differences between the market interest rates and the rates at the inception of these financial instruments 
based on apria s term debt outstanding at december  and current market perception  a basis point increase in the interest rates as of december  would result in a net reduction of the market value of the instruments of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in the interest rates would result in an million net increase in the market value of apria s term debt outstanding at december
