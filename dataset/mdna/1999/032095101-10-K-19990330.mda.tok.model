sales of cable products increased compared to  
such increase is primarily due to increased sales of coaxial cable for international cable television applications and increased sales of flat ribbon cable for communication applications  partially offset by a decline in sales of coaxial cable for us cable television applications as a result of soft demand and competitive pricing pressures

the decrease in cash from operating activities in compared to is primarily attributable to increased interest payments million  million on borrowings resulting from the merger and recapitalization and increased income taxes paid million  million 
in  cash from operating activities was higher than primarily because of changes in the non cash components of working capital primarily reflecting higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures million  million and million in  and  respectively  acquisitions million  million  and million in  and  respectively and to repurchase in the open market the company s common stock million 
in conjunction with the merger and recapitalization  the company entered into a million bank agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions  comprised of a million revolving credit facility that expires in the year and a million term loan facility million tranche a maturing over a year period ending  million tranche b maturing in and million tranche c maturing in in october  the company negotiated a significant amendment and restatement to the term loan under the bank agreement

the new term loan tranche b has required amortization in and the credit agreement is secured by pledges of of the capital stock of the company s direct domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries  and the agreement requires the maintenance of certain interest coverage and leverage ratios  and includes limitations with respect to  among other things  indebtedness and restricted payments  including dividends on the company s common stock 
at december  there were million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility 
availability under the revolving credit facility at december  was  after reduction of  for outstanding letters of credit 
in july  the company entered into interest rate protection agreements that effectively fixed the company s interest cost on million of borrowings under the bank agreement to the extent that libor interest rates remain below for million of borrowings and below for million of borrowings 
the company s ebitda as defined in the bank agreement was million and million for and  respectively 
ebitda is not a defined term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not an alternative to operating income or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
the company believes that ebitda provides additional information for determining its ability to meet future debt service requirements  however  ebitda does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements 
the company s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for debt service  capital expenditures and product development activities 
the company s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on senior subordinated notes due the company has not paid  and does not have any present intention to commence payment of  cash dividends on its common stock 
the company expects that ongoing requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and product development activities will be funded by internally generated cash flow and availability under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company expects that capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
the company s required debt amortization in is million  the company s required cash interest payments for  at current interest rates  are estimated at approximately million 
the company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions 
environmental matters subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol corporation in  amphenol and allied have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites 
amphenol and allied have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site 
the responsibility for costs incurred relating to these sites is apportioned between amphenol and allied based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition 
for sites covered by this agreement  to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition  allied is currently obligated to pay of the costs up to million and of the costs in excess of million 
at december   approximately million of the total costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement 
management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating  aluminum  copper  brass and steel used for contacts  shells and cable  and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies  inserts and cable 
in general  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
risk management the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions 
in other cases involving us export sales  raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale  such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials 
recent accounting change in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
the company is in the process of evaluating the effect this new standard will have on the company s financial statements 
the company is required to adopt fas beginning after january  information systems and the year the year issue is primarily the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such computer systems will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to a disruption in the operation of such systems 
in  the company began a systematic review of all of its business information systems to ensure that the systems now in use worldwide will be year compliant before the turn of the century 
the company has established a year program management group to provide overall guidance and direction for this compliance mission 
communications were initiated to all of the company s business units focusing on the critical nature of this project and the program management group has continually monitored the progress and status of each business unit 
the program management group has focused its efforts on four main areas information systems software and hardware  non information technology systems  facilities equipment  and customer and vendor relationships 
the company expects its year conversion project to be completed on a timely basis so as to not significantly impact business operations 
based on the assessment efforts to date  the company does not believe that the year issue will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company operates a number of business units worldwide and has a large supplier base and believes that this will mitigate any adverse impact 
the company s beliefs and expectations  however  are based on certain assumptions and expectations that ultimately may prove to be inaccurate 
potential sources of risk include a the inability of principal suppliers to be year ready  which could result in delays in product deliveries from such suppliers  b disruption of the product distribution channel  including ports and transportation vendors and c the general breakdown of necessary infrastructure such as electricity supply 
the company is developing contingency plans to reduce the impact of transactions with non compliant suppliers and other parties 
although there can be no assurance that multiple business disruptions caused by technology failures can be adequately anticipated  the company is identifying various alternatives to minimize the potential risk to its business operations 
the company estimates the cost for its year compliance efforts to be approximately million  including the cost of new systems and upgrades some of which will be capitalized 
the cost is being funded through operating cash flows 
the company s aggregate cost estimate does not include time and costs that may be incurred by the company as a result of the failure of any third parties  including suppliers  to become year ready or costs to implement any contingency plans 
such costs are not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
euro currency conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is between january  and january  the company is addressing issues associated with the euro conversion and although the company cannot predict the overall impact of the euro conversion at this time  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations  and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital  although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
in addition  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its transaction exposures 
at december  the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had interest rate protection in the form of such swaps that effectively fixed the company s libor interest rate on million of floating rate bank debt at 
at december   the three month libor rate was 
such swap agreements are in effect to the extent that libor remains below for million of debt and remains below for an additional million of debt 
these swap agreements expire in july a change in the libor interest rate at december  would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately million 
however  if the libor interest rate increased above a increase from the libor interest rate at december   further increases above would have a more significant effect in increasing interest expense 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
