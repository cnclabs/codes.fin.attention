the decrease in the effective tax rate is the result of a state income tax refund for prior year filings 
the year to year increase of income tax expense was the result of the percent increase in pretax income 
as the company increases its foreign loans and investments in relation to total assets these activities are not taxable in the state of florida thus reducing the overall effective tax rate

operating expenses dollars in thousands for the year ended december  to to change change employee compensation and benefits    occupancy and equipment    other operating expenses    legal expense  total operating expenses    year the ability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a digit year after is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs and equipment which are dependent on embedded chip technology using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or equipment that are date dependent may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  or a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company began the process of assessing and preparing its computer systems and applications to be functional on january  in june the company has also been communicating with third parties which it interfaces with  such as customers  counter parties  payment systems  vendors and others to determine whether they will be functional on or before january  the company has provided compliance certification questionnaires to each of its customers in order to determine their ability to be year compliant 
the company has amended its credit policy manual to require the company to terminate business with a customer unless the company is assured that such customer is or will be year compliant in the near future  except in such instances where the customer s failure to be year compliant will not  either individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company 
if a customer does not respond to the questionnaire or if its response does not provide the company with adequate assurance that such customer s failure to be year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on the company  the company will not renew its current relationship with that customer 
since percent of the loan portfolio matures within days  the majority of the portfolio would be subject to the amended credit policy 
there can be no assurance that the parties mentioned above will become year compliant on a timely basis 
we believe that the process of modifying all mission critical applications of the company will continue as planned and expect all of the testing  changes and verifications by june  as dictated by ffiec guidelines 
research to verify compatibility of counter parties  payment systems  vendors and others has been conducted 
these systems were divided into critical and non critical categories 
the company expects to have all testing  changes and verification on the critical systems completed by june  as dictated by ffiec guidelines 
the non critical systems will continue to be reviewed and tested and management will determine if changes or replacement is deemed necessary 
concurrently  the company is in the process of upgrading its computers systems to accommodate the growth of the past two years 
these new systems when installed are year compliant 
we believe the total costs relating exclusively to year compliance will be approximately  which amount is not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  of these estimated expenses 
any purchased hardware or software in connection with this process will be capitalized in accordance with normal company policy 
personnel and all other costs are being expensed as incurred the costs and dates on which the company plans to complete the year process are based on our best estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ

these countries had contingencies  which did not exceed percent of the company s total contingencies during the period indicated 
liquidity the company seeks to manage its assets and liabilities to reduce the potential adverse impact on net interest income that might result from changes in interest rates through systematic monitoring of maturity mismatches 
the company s investment decision making takes into account not only the rates of return and their underlying degree of risk  but also liquidity requirements  including minimum cash reserves  withdrawal and maturity of deposits and additional demand for funds 
for any given period  the pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities reprice 
an excess of assets or liabilities over these matched items results in a gap or mismatch  as shown on table sixteen 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity and normally means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income while a decrease in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
however  because different types of assets and liabilities with similar maturities may reprice at different rates or may otherwise react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates may not necessarily have such effects on net interest income 
all of the company s assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars and therefore the company has no material foreign exchange risk 
cash and cash equivalents were million on december   an increase from million from december  during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used in investing activities was million and net cash provided by financing activities was million 
for further information on cash flows  see the consolidated statement of cash flows on page in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s principal sources of liquidity and funding are its diverse deposit base and the sales of bankers acceptances as well as loan participations 
the level and maturity of deposits necessary to support the company s lending and investment activities is determined through monitoring loan demand and through its asset liability management process 
the other borrowings mentioned in the balance sheet review and in note seven of the financial statements were a result of a security transaction 
the trust preferred offering completed december  will provide adequate liquidity for the next year so that management does not consider the request by the federal reserve that was mentioned in part i item of this document to have a material effect on the operations for the remainder of calendar year considerations in managing the company s liquidity position include  but is not limited to  scheduled cash flows from existing assets  contingencies and liabilities  as well as projected liquidity needs arising from anticipated extensions of credit 
furthermore  the liquidity position is monitored daily by management to maintain a level of liquidity conducive to efficient operations and is continuously evaluated as part of the asset liability management process 
historically  the company has increased its level of deposits to allow for its planned asset growth 
customer deposits have increased through the branch network  and private banking customers  as well as deposits related to the trade activity 
the majority of the company s deposits are short term and closely match the short term nature of the company s assets 
at december  interest earning assets maturing within days were  million  representing percent of total earning assets 
the short term nature of the loan portfolio and the fact that a portion of the loan portfolio consists of bankers acceptances provides additional liquidity to the company 
liquid assets at december  were million  percent of total assets  and consisted of cash and cash equivalents  due from banks time and foreign treasury bills 
at december  the company had been advised of million in available interbank funding 
table sixteen presents the projected maturities or interest rate adjustments of the company s earning assets and interest bearing funding sources based upon the contractual maturities or adjustment dates at december  the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the company and the related interest rate sensitivity gap given in the following table may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods

in addition  although the company s credit losses have been relatively limited to date  management believes that the level of the company s allowance should reflect the potential for political and economic instability in certain countries of the region and the possibility that serious economic difficulties in a country could adversely affect all of the company s loans to borrowers in or doing business with that country 
determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses requires management s judgment  including application of the factors described above to assumptions and estimates made in the context of changing political and economic conditions in many of the countries of the region 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s current allowance for credit losses will prove to be adequate in light of future events and developments 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was approximately million  an increase of percent from million at december  this increase is largely a function of the loan growth during the year

the company usually places an asset on nonaccrual status when any payment of principal or interest is over days past due or earlier if management determines the collection of principal or interest to be unlikely 
loans over days past due may not be placed on nonaccrual if they are in the process of collection and are either secured by property having a realizable value at least equal to the outstanding debt and accrued interest or are fully guaranteed by a financially responsible party whom the company believes is willing and able to discharge the debt  including accrued interest 
in most cases  if a borrower has more than one loan outstanding under its line with the company and any of its individual loans becomes over days past due  the company places all outstanding loans to that borrower on nonaccrual status 
the company does not have a rigid chargeoff policy but instead charges off loans on a case by case basis as determined by management and approved by the board of directors 
in some instances  loans may remain in the nonaccrual category for a period of time during which the borrower and the company negotiate restructured repayment terms 
the company attributes its consistent basis of asset quality to the short term nature of its loan portfolio  the composition of its borrower base  the importance that borrowers in the region attach to maintaining their continuing access to financing for foreign trade and to the company s loan underwriting policies 
the company accounts for impaired loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
under these standards  individually identified impaired loans are measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received  using the historical effective loan rate as the discount rate 
alternatively  measurement may also be based on observable market prices or  for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment  measurement may be based on the fair value of the collateral 
the company evaluates commercial loans individually for impairment  while groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans generally residential mortgage and installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
the following table sets forth information regarding the company s nonperforming loans at the dates indicated 
total nonperforming loans to total loans remains within the historical levels 
however  the nonperforming loans to total assets ratio has improved when compared to prior year results

at december   and december  the company had no nonaccruing investment securities 
for the year ended december  the amount of interest income that was accrued and that would have been accrued on the loans in the previous table in accordance with their contractual terms were approximately thousand  all of which represented interest income on domestic loans  and thousand of which thousand represented interest income on domestic loans and thousand represented interest income on foreign loans  respectively 
management does not believe that there is a material amount of loans not included in the foregoing table where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers would cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in such loans becoming nonaccruing loans 
capital resources stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  this increase was due to million of retained earnings and million of common stock issued from exercise of stock options 
during the company paid dividends on preferred stock of thousand  which were within the amounts allowed by banking and holding company regulations 
the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
the regulations require the company and the bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital classification is also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of tier i capital as defined in the regulations to total average assets as defined and minimum ratios of tier i and total capital as defined to risk weighted assets as defined 
note nine of the consolidated financial statements reports company and bank capital ratios 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management in the normal course of conducting business activities  the company is exposed to market risk which includes both price and liquidity risk 
the company s price risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates  and foreign exchange rates that may result in changes in values of financial instruments 
the company does not have material direct market risk related to commodity and equity prices 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the company may not be able to satisfy current and future financial commitments or that the company may not be able to liquidate financial instruments at market prices 
risk management policies and procedures have been established and are utilized to manage the company s exposure to market risk 
the strategy of the company is to operate at an acceptable risk environment while maximizing its earnings 
market risk is managed by the asset liability committee which formulates and monitors the performance of the company based on established levels of market risk as dictated by policy 
in setting the tolerance levels of market risk  the committee considers the impact on both earnings and capital potential changes in the outlook in market rates  global and regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
the company s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage interest rate risk through the structuring of balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios 
it is the strategy of the company to maintain as neutral an interest rate risk position as possible 
by utilizing this strategy the company locks in a spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
given the matching strategy of the company and the fact that it does not maintain significant medium and or long term exposure positions  the company s interest rate risk will be measured and quantified through an interest rate sensitivity report 
for any given period  the company s pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities reprice 
an excess of assets or liabilities over these matched items results in a gap or mismatch 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity and normally means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
on the other hand a negative gap denotes liability sensitivity and normally means that a decline in interest rates would have a positive effect in net interest income 
however  because different types of assets and liabilities with similar maturities may reprice at different rates or may otherwise react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates may not necessarily have such effects on net interest income 
table sixteen provides the company s interest rate sensitivity reports as of december  this table shows that interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded interest earning assets by million 
the company monitors that the assets and liabilities are closely matched to minimize interest rate risk 
on december  the interest rate risk position of the company was not significant since the impact of a basis point rise or fall of interest rates over the next months is estimated at percent of net income 
substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars therefore the company has no material foreign exchange risk 
in addition  the company has no trading account securities  therefore it is not exposed to market risk resulting from trading activities 
note fourteen of the consolidated financial statements reports fair value calculations of financial instruments 
as reported in this note  the carrying values approximate their fair values which generally minimizes the exposure to market risk resulting from interest from interest rate fluctuations 
this minimal risk is the result of the short term nature of the company s interest earning assets and the matching maturity level of the interest bearing liabilities 
on a daily basis the bank s senior vice president of finance and the bank s treasurer are responsible for measuring and managing market risk
