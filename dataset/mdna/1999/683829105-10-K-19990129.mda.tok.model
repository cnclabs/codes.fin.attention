see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and investments  joint ventures  strategic alliances and divestitures in item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company has significant investments in scotland and japan 
changes in the value of those countries currencies  relative to the us dollar  are recorded as direct charges or credits to equity 
in addition to the manufacturing operations in scotland and japan  the company also has sales presence in germany  france  spain  the united kingdom  and asia 
a significant weakening of the currencies in europe or asia  in relation to the us dollar  could reduce the reported results of those operations 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s sales are export sales which could be subject to competitive price pressures if the us dollar was to strengthen compared to the currency of foreign competitors markets and products telecommunications

manufacturing the company s initial growth came from the development of high precision coated products for use primarily in defense and aerospace applications and in sophisticated analytical equipment 
these types of coated products are produced by relatively costly batch processes and continue to represent a portion of the company s revenues 
from this base  the company has expanded into commercial markets by designing and fabricating continuous coating equipment capable of producing a high volume of relatively less complex products at lower unit costs 
this large scale equipment enables the company to serve broad commercial markets with many of its products 
the company has developed many of its thin film coating processes and has designed  fabricated or significantly customized most of the coating equipment used in production  including its continuous coaters  batch coaters and high speed roll to roll coaters 
the company believes its ability to design and build this specialized equipment  and its ability to develop proprietary process technologies  has been an important factor in enabling it to compete successfully 
consequently  the company maintains an extensive array of thin film coating equipment  glass fabrication equipment  metrology equipment and precision injection molding equipment to meet customer requirements for coated products  fabricated glass components and molded plastic optics components 
the company employs various coating processes which it has developed and established over many years including batch coating by evaporation as its historic coating process and batch coating by reactive metal mode sputtering as a proprietary  patented process 
the company employs similar evaporation and sputtering processes in its continuous  in line coating systems 
flex products also employs proprietary evaporation processes and sputtering in its high speed  roll to roll coating systems 
the company and its subsidiary operations have extensive auxiliary material preparation and glass fabrication equipment in place which allow the company to produce a broad array of coated glass and plastic components and coated products for a wide variety of applications 
the company has developed and procured extensive state of the art metrology and test equipment to allow testing and verification of technological and performance characteristics of its products 
this capability  including the expertise of the company s scientific and technical staff to develop and design specific thin film coatings to meet a customer s application requirements  is frequently an integral aspect sought by customers in selecting the company as a supplier 
through its precision polymer optics operation  whose core technology was purchased in fiscal  the company manufactures precision injection molded plastic optical components 
precision injection molded products allow for the production of aspheric surfaces  have significant cost advantages over similar products made with glass  improve impact resistance and offer a substantial weight advantage over glass components 
research and development the company devotes substantial resources to research and development in order to develop new and improve existing thin film products  processes and manufacturing equipment 
as a result  the company has developed a technological leadership position in the thin film coatings industry and customers rely on the company s thin film products and integration services expertise 
the company is developing new wavelength division multiplexing wdm products and processes to expand the information carrying capability of fiber optic telecommunication networks 
the emerging opportunities in this rapidly growing market require extremely high precision interference coating deposition technology combined with advanced fiber optic assembly and testing technology 
the company s research and development efforts also include the development of products for the projection display market  including color separation filters and various components for optical systems  working with certain customers to provide optical systems and thin film design capabilities for the display  telecommunications and instrumentation markets  the development of competitive coating processes for optical components to meet high component volume requirements  and the development of high yield processes for complex coatings and high volume assembly capabilities 
the company continues in its ongoing efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate coating and cleaning materials that may be hazardous to the environment 
flex products major research and development effort has been focused on the integration of state of the art coating processes and the development of new optically variable products with lower unit costs in order to allow for greater penetration of the decorative pigment markets currently being served by the company 
company funded research and development expenditures totaled million  million and million  or  and of revenues  during fiscal years   and patents and licenses the company believes its proprietary technology  its trade secrets and its patents are of considerable value to its business 
the company believes that its patents demonstrate and support its technological leadership position  safeguard its competitive position and support existing and potential sales volume 
the company has patents and patent applications in the united states that cover materials  processes  products and production equipment 
the company also has patents and patent applications pending in various foreign countries covering the same technology 
expiration dates for the company s various patents range from to flex products currently has patents and new patent applications pending that are separate from the company s patents 
expiration dates for flex products patents range from to flex products also has patents and patent applications pending in various foreign countries covering the same technology 
patents expiring in fiscal years through do not encompass technologies in which the company is enjoying competitive advantage 
the company  therefore  does not expect expiration of those patents to materially affect its results of operations or financial condition 
technology licensing the company selectively licenses its coating technology to other companies  primarily for integrated  mass production applications that the company would not otherwise be able to provide as a manufacturer in the ordinary course of its business 
during each of the past five years  these licenses  together with sales of equipment built for licensees in support of the licenses  have not constituted greater than of the company s consolidated revenues 
marketing the company has established strong  long term customer relationships and serves a wide range of markets  including leading manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  security ink  computers  photographic equipment  copier products  medical instruments  home entertainment products  and space and defense systems 
the company s products are sold by its sales organizations  headquartered in santa rosa  california and scotland  which communicate directly with customers engineering  manufacturing and purchasing personnel in determining the design  performance and cost specifications for customer product requirements 
the company has regional sales offices in several major cities throughout the united states and in germany  france  spain  the united kingdom and japan 
the company has established sales representative offices in other asian countries to provide more integrated marketing and sales support in these regions 
with the exception of its glareguard r product line  the company markets most of its standard  high volume coated products and fabricated glass components to oems 
its customized  technically sophisticated products are also marketed to oems in addition to defense and aerospace contractors 
the company exports some of its products to major distributors who perform product conversion and other value added process steps before resale 
the company s glareguard r product line is marketed through distributors and dealers directly to end users 
flex products sells into several significant markets with a small  technically oriented sales organization supported by operations and engineering personnel in a sales team approach 
the company s ten largest customers accounted for  and of its revenues in  and jds  the company s largest customer in  accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal sicpa  the company s largest customer in and accounted for of total sales in and and of total sales in fiscal because relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the company s sales  the loss of their business could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
however  the company believes that it has the resources and capabilities to replace any lost business over time through the development of new products and new applications for its products 
foreign sales  primarily in europe and asia  for fiscal years   and  represented  and of revenues 
sales by the company s wholly owned subsidiary in scotland represented of revenues for fiscal years  and sales by the company s wholly owned subsidiary in germany represented  and of revenues for fiscal years  and sales by these subsidiaries were primarily to customers in european countries 
in november  after the end of fiscal year  the company sold the operating assets of its german subsidiary 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales by the company s subsidiary in japan  which began operations in the second quarter of  represented and of revenues for fiscal years and sales of this subsidiary were primarily to customers in asia 
export sales by us operations to canada and latin america primarily sales to canada were  and 
of sales in  and export sales by us operations to asia pacific countries primarily asian countries were  and of sales in  and export sales by us operations to europe  middle east and africa primarily sales to europe were  and of sales in  and currency fluctuations and economic factors in canada  europe and asia could materially affect the company s future sales and results of operations 
sales of products to the federal government  primarily under subcontracts  accounted for  and of revenues for the fiscal years   and the company s cost plus fixed fee cpff government contracts for fiscal years  and are subject to pending governmental audit review 
the audits entail  primarily  a review of costs and expenses charged to government contracts with the focus on potential adjustments to the allocation of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense allocations to cpff contracts were  for   for  and  for the company does not expect pending governmental audits to result in adjustments that will have a material impact on future operating results 
raw materials and suppliers the primary raw materials used by the company in its coating operations are various forms of glass  germanium  fused silica and several types of plastic and inorganic coating materials  such as magnesium fluoride  silicon dioxide  aluminum or germanium 
the company has more than one supplier for each of its raw materials and maintains adequate inventories and close working relationships with its suppliers to assure a continuous and adequate supply for production 
the company purchases special grade flat glass under long term arrangements from one major us glass supplier 
the company has not experienced any significant interruptions in production due to a shortage of raw material 
substrate materials are purchased by the company or supplied by customers  while coating materials and their composition are generally supplied by the company  as they are often considered a proprietary element of the manufacturing process 
in the company s precision polymer optics operation  the primary raw material used is high quality granular polycarbonite plastic base stock that the company procures from one principal supplier 
although the company has experienced price increases for this raw material  and there is currently product supply allocation  it has been able to maintain its supply because of the long term customer relationship with the supplier 
flex products uses significant quantities of plastic film and inorganic coating materials in the manufacture of its products 
there is more than one supplier for both materials  and flex products has not experienced production interruptions due to a shortage of raw materials 
seasonality the company s business is not seasonal in any material sense 
for the last five fiscal years  the company has shut down significant portions of its operations between christmas and new year s day 
as a result  during the last five fiscal years  normally scheduled workdays for the first fiscal quarter have averaged compared to an average of for the other three fiscal quarters 
nonetheless  the company generally has sufficient manufacturing capacity and the ability to schedule additional production shifts to meet its customers shipment requirements in any period of the year 
backlog the company s backlog of orders at the end of each of the last three fiscal years ended october   and was as follows in millions all orders in backlog at october  are scheduled for shipment during the amount of backlog at october  represents only a portion of anticipated sales in  with new orders historically comprising the major portion of sales in a fiscal year 
backlog consists of new orders on which shipments have not yet started or unfilled portions of orders which are only partly completed 
some of these orders are completed within several days of receipt  while others are not completed for a number of months 
substantially all orders included in backlog are subject to cancellation without penalty  however  the company generally has not experienced significant order cancellations 
contractually specified delivery dates on orders sometimes are adjusted at the request of either the customer or the company 
flex products has multi year supply contracts with two of its customers which include annual buy requirements with take or pay provisions 
it is the practice of flex products to only include specifically scheduled shipment releases under these contracts in reported backlog 
competition the company believes its ability to compete successfully in its markets depends on a number of factors  both within and outside of its control  including the price  quality and performance of the company s products  the emergence of new optical standards  the ability to maintain adequate coating capacity and sources of raw materials  the efficiency of its manufacturing and production  the rate at which customers design the company s products into their products  the number and nature of the company s competitors in a given market  the assertion of intellectual property rights and general market and economic conditions 
the company attempts to position itself as the exclusive or principal supplier to most of its key customers 
to the extent competitors offer similar products to the company s customers  pricing pressure may result 
when the company is unable to differentiate its product offerings  competition and related pressure on profit margins can be intense 
the company s competitors include several private companies whose sales of coated products are believed to be considerably less than the company s  as well as coating operations that comprise only a portion of the total business of other companies 
the company believes none of these competitors have the wide array of technologies or coating capabilities available at ocli 
the company has a large number of domestic and foreign competitors for its glareguard r anti glare optical filters 
companies that purchase coated glass and assemble and sell filters in competition with the company include fellows  polaroid  acco and m 
the company is the world s largest manufacturer of anti reflective optical filters  as measured by total number of units produced  manufacturing filters for both glareguard r products and private label distributors 
glareguard r is one of the most recognized brand names in its market  both domestically and internationally 
flex products position in its major market is technologically proprietary and patent protected 
in this market  and in the remainder of its business  flex products competes through product innovation and customer service 
flex s competitors include companies offering competing products representing alternative technical approaches to meet given market needs 
the company responds to competition primarily on the basis of the advanced technical characteristics and quality of its products  its ability to meet and exceed individual customer design and performance specifications  its dependability and capability as a manufacturer and supplier  the quality of technical assistance and service furnished to its customers  and the competitive pricing of its products 
employees at october   the company  including flex products  had  employees of whom  were employed domestically  were employed by the company s operations in hillend  scotland  were employed by the company s ocli mmg division in goslar  germany  were employed in the company s sales and administrative offices in europe and were employed by ocli asia in japan 
in november   the company sold the operating assets of its ocli mmg division 
see investments  joint ventures  strategic alliances and divestitures in item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
at that time  the employees of ocli mmg became employees of glas trosch gmbh  a privately held company in switzerland 
the company has not experienced work stoppages due to labor difficulties 
the company believes its employee relations are satisfactory 
none of the company s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
ocli attributes much of its success to its strong relationship with its employees 
the company has instituted several employee oriented programs  including total quality management and high performance work system practices  to enhance the quality and efficiency of its operations while improving employee relations 
in  the board of directors approved increases in severance benefits for its domestic employees  not including flex products employees  in the event of certain changes in control of the company 
these severance arrangements have been extended through november joint ventures  investments  acquisitions and divestitures information regarding joint ventures  investments  acquisitions and divestitures is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and in note to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has identified its year risk in three components internal business software  internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology  and external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
see impact of year in item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition environmental in  the company discovered ground water contamination at its facilities in santa rosa  california 
with the assistance of its environmental consultants and under the regulatory guidance of the california regional water quality control board  the company established a program for reducing contaminant concentration levels to acceptable federal and state levels 
in prior years  the company recorded accruals to cover the future estimated cost of drilling additional extraction and monitoring wells and considers those accruals to be adequate 
the company spent   and  in fiscal years  and for drilling  extraction and monitoring wells  which were charged against those accruals 
in addition  the accrual was reduced by a total of  in and as a result of approval of the company s final remediation plan by the california regional water quality control board

item legal proceedings over the past several years  the company has been engaged in litigation in the united kingdom uk involving infringement of a company patent by the uk companies  pilkington pe limited and pilkington plc 
the company won its action at the patents county courts level but lost on appeal to the uk house of lords 
in october  the company settled the claim for approximately  most of which had been accrued in previous periods 
on march   optical corporation of america oca and certain of its directors and officers affiliates commenced suit against the company in the superior court  middlesex county  commonwealth of massachusetts 
the complaint arose out of a letter of intent executed by the company and oca in march and an ensuing merger agreement executed by the company and oca in june under the merger agreement  the company would have acquired oca 
the complaint sought damages for costs and expenses incurred by oca in pursuing the merger transaction with the company due to the company s alleged negligent misrepresentations to oca and affiliates and the company s alleged breach of its letter of intent with oca 
the company filed counterclaims against oca and the affiliates based on oca s breach of the merger agreement and sought damages based on the difference between the value of oca s business to the company and the agreed upon purchase price under the merger agreement 
in january  after the end of the fiscal year  the company  oca and oca s shareholders settled the litigation 
settlement proceeds  net of applicable legal expenses  approximated million  which will be recorded as revenue in the first quarter of fiscal in addition to the cash proceeds  the company will receive million in business transaction value through product purchase discounts or purchase of ocli products over a period not to exceed three years 
future business opportunities  not expected to affect company results over the next twelve months  were also included in the agreement 
in july of  sicpa filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court in order to block an attempted initial public offering by flex products arguing that such an offering without sicpa s consent was prohibited by flex products articles of incorporation  as well as by certain contractual provisions between the company and sicpa 
in fiscal  the company announced that it had completed final negotiations for the settlement of the litigation with sicpa 
under the terms of the settlement  the company and sicpa agreed to modify their co ownership agreement to enable ocli to more effectively manage the day to day operations of flex products  to allow for public financing of flex products operations and to modify the license and supply agreement between flex products and sicpa 
the modification to the license and supply agreement provided for more attractive scheduled pricing discounts on higher volume purchases and changed the scheduled order patterns to be consistent with the company s fiscal quarters

other matters impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has identified its year risk in three components internal business software  internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology  and external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
internal business software 
during  as part of a business modernization program intended to reduce cycle time and improve profitability  the company purchased an enterprise resource planning system erp system which the software vendor has indicated is year compliant 
the total estimated hardware  software and installation cost of the erp system is million of which million has been spent to date 
the company is in the implementation phase for this system and other ancillary financial systems with full implementation scheduled for september  based on this schedule  the company expects to be in full compliance with its internal financial systems before the year however if  due to unforeseen circumstances  the implementation is not completed on a timely basis  the year could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
contingency plans have been established in a few areas where the company feels there is some risk that the system will not be implemented before the year those plans include adapting some of the company s currently existing systems to be year compliant 
the cost of making those adaptations are not expected to be material and will be expensed in the period incurred 
internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology 
the company has taken an inventory of all of its non financial software and equipment that may be affected by the year  has identified the non financial software and equipment that is critical to its operations and is in the process of assigning the method of determining year compliance or noncompliance ie  testing vendor certification  etc 
for each item that is critical to the operation of the company 
the company does not  at this time  have sufficient data to estimate the cost of achieving year compliance for its non financial systems 
if the company is unable to achieve year compliance for its major non financial systems  the year could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
since the company is in the information gathering phase  the company does not currently have a contingency plan in place for its internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology 
full year compliance is scheduled for september  external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting its critical suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
it is expected that full identification will be completed by april  to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company intends to change suppliers  service providers or contractors to those that have demonstrated year readiness 
however  the company cannot be certain that it will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors 
the company does not currently have any formal information concerning the year compliance status of its customers but has received indications that most of its customers are working on year compliance 
in the event that any of the company s significant customers and suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them with new customers or alternate suppliers  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected

due to the short maturities of cash equivalents  carrying amounts approximate fair value 
by policy  cash investments are limited to obligations of the us  us  german and japanese governments  prime commercial paper  bank repurchase agreements collateralized by direct obligations of the us  us  german or japanese governments and savings accounts with commercial banks 
amounts deposited with commercial banks are also limited in amount by financial institutions 
the company does not use derivatives or equity investments for cash investment purposes 
as the company s long term debt obligations are at fixed rates  the company does not have cash flow exposure due to rate changes on its long term debt 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on current interest rates offered to the company for similar instruments 
from time to time  the company enters into interest rate swaps primarily to reduce its interest rate exposure from floating to fixed rate 
in  the company entered into an interest rate swap for anticipated debt refinancing in the amount of million 
the purpose of the swap was to fix the reference rate for the debt at to eliminate the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations until the loan refinance was completed

a significant weakening of the currencies in europe or asia in relation to the us dollar could reduce the reported results of those operations 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s sales are export sales which could be subject to competitive price pressures if the us dollar were to strengthen compared to the currency of foreign competitors 
the company does  from time to time  enter into purchase  sales or debt arrangements denominated in currencies other than its functional currency which exposes the company to currency risk on open receivable and payable balances 
the company is also exposed to exchange risk on open intercompany balances that some of the foreign subsidiaries have with the company and other of its subsidiaries 
the company has not entered into contracts to hedge any of these risks and the company does not consider its net exposure on these items to be material 
during  approximately of the company s consolidated sales constituted sales to customers in canada and latin america primarily to customers in canada  approximately of the company s consolidated sales constituted sales to customers in europe  middle east and africa primarily to customers in europe and approximately of the company s consolidated sales constituted sales to customers in the asian pacific primarily to customers in asia 
the company  from time to time  enters into derivative transactions in order to hedge foreign currency risk on existing commitments  open receivables  payables and debt instruments when the currency risk is considered significant to the company 
in addition  the company may enter into interest rate swaps or similar instruments in order to reduce interest rate risk on its debt instruments 
the company does not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
in  the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the principal and interest payments under a million loan that is denominated in german marks

as the company s existing derivative contracts and policies regarding the use of derivatives require that cash flows under financial derivatives match cash flows under existing firm commitments  the company does not expect adoption of sfas to affect its results of operations or cash flows but  as the statement requires separate presentation of the fair value of derivative instruments  the company s statement of financial position will be affected by adoption of the statement
