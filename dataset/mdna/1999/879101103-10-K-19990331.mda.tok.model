readiness for year background 
as the year approaches  a critical issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs  operating systems and embedded computer chips can accommodate the year date value 
the company has a year project team in place with overall responsibility for the company s year compliance programs 
in addition  executive management regularly monitors the status of the company s year remediation plans 
project 
the company has identified potential year risks in four categories software and system products the company sells to customers  internal business software and information technology systems  systems other than information technology systems non it systems  and third party suppliers to the company 
the company s year project includes the following phases for the first three categories above identifying year risks  assigning priorities to identified risks  testing year compliance for risks determined to be material to the company  correcting problems determined to be material and not year compliant  retesting corrections that have been implemented  and developing contingency plans 
with respect to the company s third party suppliers  the company s year project consists of the following phases contacting suppliers for information concerning their year readiness  prioritizing suppliers as to relative importance  validating supplier responses regarding year compliance  and developing contingency plans in the event that one or more suppliers fail to achieve year compliance 
assessment 
the software and systems products that the company sells to customers consist of internally developed software  third party software licensed by the company for use in or with the company s products  hardware systems designed and manufactured by the company and hardware systems designed and manufactured by third parties 
the company has identified priorities  completed the initial testing phase and begun offering solutions to its customers 
the company believes that its current product offerings are year compliant 
for past product offerings that the company is still supporting  the company is offering releases that should make such products year compliant 
however  failure to achieve year compliance for any products could materially adversely affect sales in additionally  if any of the company s mission critical products were to fail in the field as a result of year noncompliance  such failure could result in substantial liability to the company and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results  business  market position  reputation and prospects 
internal business software and systems consist primarily of the company s business information systems in the united states and at the company s japanese subsidiary 
the company has completed its initial year project phases with respect to its business systems  and is in the process of developing  implementing and testing the necessary modifications 
the company believes that its internal business software and systems will be year compliant 
however  if the company s business systems are not year compliant  the company could experience interruptions to its production process  development programs and general business operations 
the company has been advised by the suppliers of its non it systems  which consist primarily of environmental systems such as fire suppression and security systems in the various buildings the company occupies  that such systems are year compliant 
third party suppliers provide component parts  purchased assemblies and contract manufacturing services incorporated by the company into the products and systems it sells 
the company is requiring that each of its key suppliers certify whether they are year compliant 
the company has also prioritized its suppliers by level of criticality to the company s business 
based on information received from its suppliers  the company estimates that approximately of its critical suppliers are presently year compliant 
the company plans to monitor its critical suppliers and either develop alternate sources or increase inventory levels prior to the year for those vendors considered to be at risk of not timely achieving year compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that such alternate sources will be available or that adequate inventory levels will be attainable if necessary  and the company could experience parts shortages and production interruptions if one or more key third party suppliers experience year problems 
costs 
incremental costs of the company s year project have consisted of the hiring of two contractors to assist with administrative duties related to the year project  consulting by pricewaterhousecoopers llp at the initial stages of the project and a third party audit team  which provides year compliance test audit reports 
such costs in the aggregate have not been material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the balance of the effort for the company s year project has been by employees whose costs for this project are not tracked separately 
the company believes that costs for the remainder of the year project will not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risks 
the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if the company or any of its key suppliers or customers do not achieve year compliance 
although the company s year project is expected to minimize the company s risks of experiencing a year problem  inherent risks and uncertainties exist despite the company s efforts 
there can be no assurance that a failure on the part of the company  its products  its key suppliers or its customers will not be disruptive to the company s business 
as a result of these uncertainties the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows
