during  was ceded in premiums on these treaties with  ceded in losses

competitive market conditions and the company s ability to write surety bonds for larger contractors has resulted  on many bonds  in the substitution of indemnity agreements for liquid and non liquid collateral 
the company  through its ongoing reserve analysis  has estimated the benefit to be derived from such agreements and reduced estimates of ultimate losses incurred accordingly 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased its estimate of such salvage and subrogation recoveries by approximately million which is partially attributable to salvage and subrogation on losses incurred during the fourth quarter

net losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased from  in to  in this resulted in a decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio from in to in the decreased loss ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for contract performance and payment bonds from in to in as well as a decrease in adverse loss experience on the company s private passenger automobile program in the state of arizona 
the loss ratio on contract performance and payment bonds in was negatively impacted by increased severity caused by a number of large losses reported in that year

market risk the main objective in managing the investment portfolios of the company is to maximize total investment returns while minimizing credit risks  in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including expected underwriting results  tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are primarily managed by the company s investment advisors based on guidelines established by management and approved by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to financial instruments of the company primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment and equity prices 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
since most of the company s property and casualty business is short tailed in nature  the company has established duration guidelines to be commensurate with our liabilities 
our guidelines have established duration of the portfolio to be between years 
the following table provides information about all our fixed maturity investments which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
december  december  estimated there after amortized market cost value dollars in thousands tax exempt         average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities         average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total         prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates than can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
equity market risk is defined as the chance that market influences will affect the expected returns of all equities 
returns are influenced not only by the fundamental attributes of investment securities  but by the price movements of the general marketplace 
much of this depends on the sensitivity to the overall market of the individual issue 
the company attempts to reduce this risk through diversification and a focus on high quality  blue chip investments 
other matters year issues the company and its third party vendors are highly reliant on the use of computers and embedded technology for the conduct of its business 
accordingly the company has  for several years  been in the process of analyzing  and to the extent necessary either replacing non year yk compliant systems or fixing non compliant yk systems in order to make them yk compliant 
the following is a summary of the company s efforts to date with respect to yk issues the company s state of readiness the company has summarized its exposure to yk issues by four general categories which are corporate systems surety specific systems property and casualty systems third party vendor systems the company s state of readiness with respect to each of these categories is as follows corporate systems the company has five significant corporate wide applications which include oracle financials  the system providing electronic interface between oracle financials and the company s bank  fixed asset accounting  payroll  reinsurance and corporate e mail 
the company has completed its assessment of these systems and believes that all of these systems other than the reinsurance system are yk compliant 
this conclusion is based on either certifications received from the third party vendor s supplying the system or testing performed by the company for internally developed or modified systems 
as stated the only currently deployed corporate system which the company believes to be non yk compliant is the reinsurance system 
the company is currently analyzing whether to replace the system with a different yk compliant product or modify the current system to make it yk compliant 
currently the company estimates that the current version would require one person month to make this system compliant 
surety specific systems the company has fourteen surety specific systems which vary in their significance from critical such as the surety production system commonly known as abs to non critical applications which only affect a small portion of the surety business such as several retail bail production systems 
the company has completed its assessment of its fourteen surety specific systems and believes that all of the mission critical surety specific systems are yk compliant other than the company s probate production system  cash collateral system and one bail system 
this conclusion is based on either certifications received from the third party vendor s supplying the system or testing performed by the company for internally developed or modified systems 
the company is currently in the process of modifying its abs system in order for it to be used for probate production and is proceeding with completing system changes for the cash collateral and bail systems 
the company expects that these modifications will be completed during the second quarter of  and will be implemented immediately thereafter 
property and casualty systems the company has mission critical systems for its property and casualty operations 
these include a personal lines system supplied by an outside vendor  a commercial lines system also supplied by an outside vendor  a system for electronic transmission for the company s program business and data replicating software supplied by an outside vendor 
the company has completed its assessment of these four systems and believes that the personal lines system  the internally developed system for electronic transmission of program business and the data replicating system are yk compliant while the commercial lines system is not yk compliant 
this conclusion is based on either certifications received from the third party vendor s supplying the system or testing performed by the company for internally developed or modified systems 
the company is currently in the process of developing a new commercial lines system to replace the non yk compliant system supplied by an outside vendor 
the company currently estimates that this system will be completed and installed during the third quarter of third party vendor systems in addition to the above systems where the company is primarily responsible for assessing  analyzing and implementing yk compliant systems  the company may also be affected by any of the agents  brokers  suppliers  financial institutions or others with whom the company does business who may be materially affected by yk problems and thus indirectly affect the company 
where appropriate  the company has inquired as to the state of readiness with respect to these third parties  but the company has not performed any independent yk testing of these systems as the company does not believe that such independent testing would be cost justified 
costs to address the year issues the majority of the costs associated with system development of year compliant systems have been associated with the development of the abs surety production system and the property and casualty personal and commercial lines systems 
in all three of these cases  the underlying previously utilized systems had significant business related flaws  such that they needed to be replaced without regard to year compliance issues 
the company does not believe that the incremental costs of making the replacement systems yk compliant were or will be significant 
further  for those systems which have been modified solely to assure yk compliance  the company does not believe that these costs are material 
risks of the company s year issues the company has analyzed the risks associated with the year issues and concluded that the biggest risk which the company can have a reasonable influence toward preventing is the lack of yk compliance by the commercial lines property and casualty production system 
the commercial lines represent approximately  of written premiums for the company and the lack of a yk compliant system for this business could have a significant adverse impact on the company s results 
the company has also reviewed the underwriting risks associated with its insureds for both the property and casualty and surety products and believes that the major risk with respect to yk non compliance relates to the surety product 
should yk problems affect the ability of the company s principals to complete projects and pay subcontractors on a timely basis it could have a material adverse affect on the company s surety loss ratio 
further  should yk problems affect the ability of obligees to pay for work performed on bonded projects  liquidity issues for principals could also impact the company s surety loss ratio 
the company is unable to estimate the affect such risks will have on the company s financial results 
contingency plans due to the potential for sweeping problems associated with the yk issue  the company believes that any contingency plan for addressing yk must be flexible and part of a broad based disaster recovery plan 
the company s experience with disaster recovery the northridge earthquake has led it to believe that a rigid disaster recovery plan will be less effective than a flexible plan which analyzes the specific problems associated with each unique disaster and proposes solutions based on the problems encountered 
other than for the specific internal systems which are not currently yk compliant and for which the company is developing contingency plans substantially based on temporary manual intervention  the company believes that a broad based disaster recovery plan will be more effective in addressing the multitude of potential yk problems 
the company has developed a disaster recovery plan and will use this plan in responding to scenarios created by the yk problem
