members of the management group were significantly involved in the business and development of the gtd while employed by the company and left the company s employ to join strategic concurrently with the gtd sale 
strategic acquired substantially all of the operating assets of the gtd in exchange for certain consideration and the assumption of certain liabilities  pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in an asset purchase agreement between the company and strategic dated october  in february  the company purchased certain assets from consilium  inc refer to note d to the consolidated financial statements and the continuing operations overview below for more information about this acquisition

in june  base ten released base tm me version the company followed in september with the release of base tm cs  which is an analog of base tm me  designed for pre approval product testing 
cost reduction measures as a result of the purchase of the flowstream product line in february  the company experienced an increase in headcount of approximately employees bringing the total headcount for base ten to approximately employees as of the acquisition date 
base ten also experienced a slight ramp up during the first and second quarters of in headcount  independent of the flowstream product line acquisition  primarily in the areas of development  sales and marketing and administration

costs were primarily reduced by downsizing the company s workforce by approximately 
discontinued operations as discussed in part  item  the consolidated financial statements of the company have been restated in order to account for the operations of the gtd as discontinued operations in view of the gtd sale 
in the restatement  all assets and liabilities of the gtd at october  and december  and all items of income and expense attributable to gtd s operations for all periods presented have been eliminated from consolidation and accounted for on a net basis as assets held for sale and discontinued operations

continuing operations overview since  base ten  through its then existing medical technology division has been engaged in the design  development  and marketing of comprehensive software solutions for the regulated manufacturing industries  and most recently  computerized manufacturing execution systems for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
management believes that the demand for mes in these markets is poised for significant growth over the next few years due to several factors 
for one  there is growing pressure on the company s customer base to comply with regulations promulgated by the fda  iso  and other industry standards such as gamp 
in addition  increasing competitive influences brought on by a recent business combinations occurring in the customer market  and b the rise in purchasing power among hmos and other benefit programs  have underscored the need for manufacturers to be even more cost efficient 
the company s acquisition of certain assets from consilium  inc in february broadened the company s reach into these industries with the addition of the flowstream product base tm fs  a unix based mes targeted at pharmaceutical  medical device and specialty chemical customers 
the company believes that its products are premier  standardized pc based systems running on microsoft windows nt base tm me and base tm cs and hp ux or digital vax vms base tm fs with requisite functionality and documented support required by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to assist in reducing costs while remaining fda  iso  and gamp compliant 
the company will continue to pursue a leadership position in this market 
the company has received indications from customers and prospects that compliance with industry standards is imperative to sales 
as such  efforts have been focused on compliance with certain industry standards and the company believes that both base tm me and base tm fs are compliant with fda  iso  and gamp 
as described above  there is a need for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to have mes products compliant with cgmp 
further  the company considers the additional costs of compliance with iso and gamp to be prudent investments 
personnel are in place to address product development and enhancement  sales and marketing  and customer support 
management believes absorbing these expenses in advance of revenue generation is essential to facilitating market emergence and near term growth of the company 
for use in a manufacturing environment  a system generally has to undergo validation in accordance with defined procedures determining its fitness for use in a regulated environment 
the company currently has two pharmasyst tm systems installed and validated  one at a medical device manufacturing plant and the other at a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant 
there are validated base tm fs installations at various customer sites 
one additional pharmasyst tm product and four base tm me products are believed to have completed customer testing necessary for validation 
software development expenditures are expensed as research and development until a product attains technological feasibility 
at december  pharmasyst tm and its successor  base tm me had a capitalized value of million after allowing for amortization 
development expenditures for pharmasyst tm  base tm me and other commercial products have consisted primarily of salaries of software engineers and quality assurance staff plus applicable allocated overhead 
results of discontinued operations as discussed above  the gtd was sold on december   and as such its results of operations are not included in the company s results of operations for fiscal year during  the gtd was engaged primarily in the development of the interference blanking unit based on a contract awarded to the gtd in may in addition  the gtd completed the development of the maintenance data recorder development contract awarded in april and continued the development of the electronics for the slam er missile project which the gtd was awarded in late fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations revenues company revenues increased to million in from million in the increase is due to an increase in license and related revenues of million  and service and maintenance revenues of million 
revenues for were derived from licenses and related revenues  and from service and related revenues  as compared to when revenue was derived from licenses and related revenues and from service and related revenues 
revenues from flowstream licenses  services and maintenance during accounted for million of the million increase in cost of revenues cost of revenues in was million compared with million in cost of revenues increased as a result of increased sales of the company s mes products and increased labor charges associated with the company s increased service and maintenance related revenues 
these increased costs were partly offset by decreased amortization of software development costs for pharmasyst tm and base tm me of million in from million in research and development costs research and development costs increased significantly in to million from million in this increase relates to additional personnel and related expenses being dedicated to developing future versions of the company s products 
sales and marketing expenses the company s sales and marketing expenses increased significantly in to million compared with million in the rise was mainly attributable to salaries and related expenses resulting from the hiring of additional personnel and increased sales commissions which resulted from increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses company general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in costs rose primarily as a result of increases in administrative salary and related expenses  legal  professional and consulting fees and integration costs related to the addition of the flowstream product line 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease of million expense related to the fair market value of options and warrants issued to non employee consultants for services rendered during the fair market value in each year was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
other income and expense other expense decreased from million in to million in in  other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense of million  partially offset by million of interest income and million of other income 
in the period  other expense was comprised of million of interest expense  partially offset by million of interest income 
interest expense remained consistent in the period as a result of similar average levels of debt 
interest income increased in the period as a result of higher cash balances available to earn interest 
other income increased in the period largely due to rental income earned on the sublease of building space to strategic  which was not present in the period  partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses 
continuing losses the company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of million in compared to a million net loss from continuing operations in the increased loss in was largely attributable to increases in headcount and related expenses  legal  professional and consulting fees and integration costs related to the addition of the flowstream product 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease of million expense related to the fair market value of options and warrants issued to non employee consultants for services rendered during the company expects losses in the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon  among other things  the completion of current development and testing activities for base tm me and base tm cs  timely delivery and successful installation and validation of its systems by its customers  and successful competition in the markets in which the company participates 
readiness for the year year issues generally  in today s business environment  some computers  software  and other equipment include programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than this problem the yk problem is widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year yk approaches 
the company  in anticipating yk  has kept the potential for this problem in mind when purchasing new computers  software and equipment during the past year 
the company has also considered this problem when developing new products for sale to customers 
company readiness 
the yk problem could affect computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  the company formed an internal yk committee whose goal is to minimize any disruptions of the company s business and to limit the company s liabilities resulting from the yk problem 
as a result  the company has reviewed its internal computer programs and systems  as well as the software that the company develops and sells to customers  to determine if the programs and systems will be yk compliant 
information technology systems 
during the first quarter of  the company  in anticipation of the year  replaced its existing financial accounting software system  which the company deems to be a business critical system  with a system which is vendor certified yk compliant 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with its internal operations that must be replaced or upgraded to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company presently believes that computer systems which are not currently yk compliant will be replaced or upgraded in the normal replacement cycle prior to systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  and other common devices may be affected by the yk problem 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect of  and costs of remediating  the yk problem on its office and facilities equipment  however  it currently believes that the risk of business interruption due to this equipment is minimal 
software sold to customers 
the company believes that it has substantially identified and resolved all potential yk problems with its latest mes software release  version of base tm me  as well as with version and later versions of base tm fs 
however  management also believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all yk problems affecting the company s software products have been identified or corrected due to complexity of these products and the fact that these products interact with other third party vendor products and operate on computer systems which are not under the company s control 
certain customers have earlier versions of the company s mes software  pharm tm prior to version and pharmasyst tm which have not yet been tested by the company for yk compliance 
all of the customers that have purchased these earlier versions have had substantial customization done  which dictates that yk testing and modifications must be done on a case by case basis 
these customers have been notified of the company s willingness and ability to provide yk test specifications and or manpower to help bring their version of the company s software into yk compliance 
it is a small number of customers that still operate with these earlier versions  and the company believes that it can bring these earlier versions of the company s software product into yk compliance without any material financial or human resources 
also  some customers have earlier versions of base tm fs prior to version which have not been tested for yk compliance 
however  the company has a standard upgrade path in place for bringing all of these earlier versions into yk compliance 
the upgrade has been made available and customers are currently planning the timing of when they will perform the upgrade 
the company believes that this upgrade can be provided with minimal use of financial and human resources  due to the standardized nature of this upgrade path 
costs of compliance 
the company currently believes that its computer systems will be yk compliant in a timely manner  and estimates the total costs to the company of completing any required replacements or upgrades of these internal systems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations  although no assurances can be given 
costs to be incurred are expected to be immaterial and are currently estimated at less than  third party suppliers 
the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers of the major computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the yk problem 
while the majority of the company s significant suppliers are software industry leaders and have committed to upgrades to resolve any yk problems  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while the company expects that it will be able to resolve any significant yk problems with these systems  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve any or all yk problems with these systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers 
any failure of these third parties to resolve yk problems with their systems in a timely manner could  but is not currently expected to  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
most likely consequences of year problems 
the company expects to identify and resolve all yk problems that could have a material adverse effect on its business operations prior to the year however  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all yk problems affecting the company will be identified or corrected 
it is not possible to accurately predict how many yk problem related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
as a result  management expects that the company  under a worst case scenario  could suffer the following consequences a a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for the company and its clients that may divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from its ordinary business activities  and b a small number of serious system failures related to older versions of the company s pharmasyst tm and pharm tm products that may require significant efforts by the company and or its customers to prevent or alleviate material business disruptions 
contingency plans 
the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its effort to identify and correct yk problems that may affect its internal systems  software and third party suppliers 
the company currently expects to complete its contingency plans during mid depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected third party equipment or software the timing of which would occur in the third quarter of  the hiring of additional personnel and or increased work hours for company personnel to correct  on an accelerated schedule  any yk problems that arise with the earlier versions of pharmasyst tm and pharm tm software sold to customers  and or similar approaches to any yk problems that may occur 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could  but is not currently expected to  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
based on the company s current analysis of the yk problem  as described above  the company does not believe that the yk problem will have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
disclaimer 
the discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  relating to yk compliance are forward looking statements 
the company s ability to achieve yk compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the resources needed to bring older versions of the company s pharmasyst tm and pharm tm software into yk compliance  the third party supplier s ability to modify its proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations revenues company revenues in increased to million compared with million in due to increases in deliveries of the then pharm tm product 
cost of revenues cost of revenues in was million compared with million in cost of revenues increased due to labor and overhead component cost of inventory increases primarily due to additional software development and test personnel in both the new jersey and united kingdom facilities 
amortization of software development costs for pharmasyst tm and base tm me increased from million in to million in also  in  the company wrote off a million balance of capitalized costs related to its non mes products  prenval and upacs  upon concluding that sufficient revenues and cash flows would not be generated to recover the capitalized costs for either product 
research and development costs research and development costs decreased from million in to million in  as most resources were utilized for completion and maintenance of current versions of the company s software during sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing costs increased from million in to million in due partially to an increase of million in consulting fees and increases in sales commissions and personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million compared with million in there were increases in almost all general and administrative expense categories  the largest of which was inclusion of a non cash expense of million which represents the fair market value of options and warrants issued to non employee consultants for service rendered during fiscal the fair market value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
other income and expense other expense in was million compared to million in  and was comprised of interest expense of million and million  respectively  offset partially by interest and other income of million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was related to interest on the million convertible debenture issued in and the million convertible debenture issued in the million convertible debenture  which had an annual interest rate of  was outstanding for less than three months in compared with a full year in the million convertible debenture  issued in with an annual interest rate of  was outstanding for five months in continuing losses the company incurred a loss from continuing operations before taxes of million in compared to million in the loss was reduced to million by an income tax benefit of 
million 
a major portion of the loss in compared to was attributable to the million increased amortization  as well as certain cost overruns and related penalties of million  and the million expense related to the fair market value of options and warrants issued to non employee consultants for services rendered during the increases in labor and overhead costs and interest expense also contributed to the loss 
the loss included a write off of various capitalized expenses in the sum of million representing development of the company s prenatal abnormality detection software  prenval  and early development costs of upacs as well as other operating losses including interest and amortization of million 
the major portion of the operating loss represented the company s continuing investment in the development of markets and infrastructure for the mes business 
discontinued operations the gtd incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the gtd loss in consisted primarily of operating losses incurred because of reduced revenues without the corresponding reduction in operating expenses  and  a loss of million on the gtd sale 
gtd revenues in were million compared with million in the decrease in revenues was directly attributable to the difficulty in obtaining new business due to delays in government procurement and stretched out deliveries of existing programs 
the gtd cost of sales in was million compared with million in selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared with million in liquidity and capital resources company working capital increased to million at fiscal year end december  from million at december  the company had million of cash and cash equivalents at december   up from million at december  the increase in cash during the fiscal year ended december  resulted from the realization of capital provided from financing activities of million  partially offset by the use of cash in operations of million  the use of cash in investing activities of million 
in cash used in operations has been affected primarily by the net loss of million  an increase of million in accounts receivable and a reduction of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these uses of cash have been partially offset by amortization and depreciation of million and non cash compensation expense resulting from issuance of stock options and warrants of million  included in the aforementioned net loss amount 
investing activities in have been comprised primarily of the acquisition of assets related to the flowstream product of approximately million  additions to plant and equipment of million and additions to capitalized software of million 
cash from financing activities for resulted primarily from two transactions i the net receipt in january of million related to the second installment of an investment by the company s series a redeemable convertible preferred stockholders which had been finalized in december  and ii the november  sale and issuance of  shares of class a common stock for net proceeds of million 
refer to note n to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 
the company s financial statements have been prepared on the basis that it will continue as a going concern 
the company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows in recent years 
also  at december  the company was below the million minimum net tangible assets  as defined  required for its current listing on the nasdaq national market system 
in march  the company s shareholders equity was increased by approximately million through the conversion of its million convertible debenture into common stock 
coincident with that debt conversion  the company s series a redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
these preferred stocks have certain redemption events  which if such events occurred  would provide the holder with the right to require the company to purchase their shares for cash which would adversely affect the company 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  where these rights exist such redeemable securities are categorized outside of shareholders equity and  thus  do not qualify as equity for the purposes of the nasdaq minimum net tangible asset requirement 
also  security holders may have other rights claims in connection with the march transactions described above 
to further increase the company s net tangible assets and in order to help further ensure the company s compliance with nasdaq listing requirements  management is in the process of negotiating with participants in the march debt conversion and preferred stock exchange to obtain waivers of any redemption or recession rights 
these waivers  if obtained  would eliminate the holders cash redemption rights 
this would qualify all related securities for classification in permanent stockholders equity and increase the company s qualifying net tangible assets 
if such waivers are obtained  then management believes that the company s current liquidity would be sufficient to meet its cash needs for its existing business through fiscal however  there can be no assurance that management s efforts in this regard will be successful 
if management is not successful in obtaining such waivers  and it continues to incur operating losses it could fall below the minimum net asset requirement needed to qualify for ongoing listing on nasdaq 
management s plans in this case include  among other things  attempting to improve i operating cash flow through increased license sales and service revenue  and ii increasing the level of anticipated streamlining of its selling  administration and development functions 
however there is no assurance that such plans  if implemented  will be sufficient 
further  recently there have been announcements of potential changes in senior management  which increase the uncertainty of whether existing management plans will be executed 
also  the company is considering certain significant acquisitions which depending on net liabilities assumed  if any  and on the success of cost reduction efforts to bring the acquisitions to break even  may require additional funding 
see note u to the consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will occur  or whether additional funds required  if any  would be available to base ten 
if current cash and working capital reduced by cash used in operations in is not sufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity and minimum net tangible asset requirements  the company will seek to obtain additional equity financing 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company were required to raise additional financing for the matters described above and or to continue to fund expansion  develop and enhance products and service  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  there is no assurance that adequate funds will be available or that they will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
such a limitation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operations and the financial statements do not include any adjustment that could result therefrom 
during the company eliminated million of long term debt as the convertible debenture holders converted these million  debentures into  shares of class a common stock 
subsequent to year end  on march   the holder of the million  convertible debenture converted this debenture into  shares of class a common stock which increased shareholders equity by approximately million including a non cash charge of approximately million 
as a result of these debenture conversions  the company will realize an annual interest expense savings of approximately million 
for further discussion of these debentures see note l to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   the shareholders approved the sale and issuance of series b convertible preferred stock subject to the execution of definitive agreements and the issuance of class a common stock purchase warrants to the series a convertible preferred stockholders that would receive series b convertible preferred stock 
the sale and issuance of series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred shares to the series a convertible preferred stockholders occurred in march and was in the form of an even exchange for series a convertible preferred stock series a preferred shares 
the terms of the series b preferred shares are similar to the series a preferred shares  except that a the series b preferred shares have a conversion price of that number of shares determined by dividing the mandatory redemption price by  as defined in the series a preferred stock agreement  whereas the conversion price of the series a preferred shares was equal to the lesser of i or ii the weighted volume average price as defined of the class a common stock prior to the conversion date limited to  shares  b the series b preferred shares  as a result of the conversion price of  does not provide the holder with the option to receive a subordinated promissory note  as the series a preferred shares provides  and c there will be no dividend payment due based on the price of the class a common stock  as the series a preferred shares provides 
as a result of the exchange of series a preferred shares for series b preferred shares  preferred stock dividends are no longer required to be paid by the company 
the issuance of class a common stock purchase warrants to the series a preferred stockholders that received series b preferred shares provided for the issuance of  class a common stock purchase warrants for each million of principal amount of the series a preferred shares outstanding on november  in addition to certain other series a preferred shares which were converted at per share between september  and november  these purchase warrants are four year warrants exercisable at  and provide for mandatory exercise upon the occurrence of certain events 
during   shares of series a convertible preferred stock were converted to  shares of class a common stock 
subsequent to year end  on march   the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock were exchanged for series b convertible preferred stock 
for further discussion of the series a and b preferred shares and common stock see note n and note o to the consolidated financial statements
