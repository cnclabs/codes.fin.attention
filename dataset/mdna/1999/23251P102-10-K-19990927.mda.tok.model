item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under the heading factors affecting future operating results and in the business section and elsewhere in this form k 
cyberonics undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
summary cyberonics was founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a unique therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating central nervous disorders 
clinical trials of the ncp system began with the first patient implant in november under an ide from the fda 
we received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
we were granted regulatory approval in to market and sell the ncp system in the member countries of the european union and we also have permission to sell in certain other international markets 
however  through fiscal  we devoted only limited resources to marketing and sales activities internationally  and have been expanding our international presence through fiscal international sales of the ncp system have been limited to date 
we are engaged in obtaining and expanding reimbursement approvals from the various health care provider systems in the united states and in key international markets 
to date  the ncp system has been reimbursed by several payors in the united states and by a number of payment authorities in a limited number of international markets 
we do not expect continued sales growth unless additional reimbursement approvals are obtained for the ncp system 
from inception through july  our primary focus was on obtaining fda approval for the ncp system 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities which includes product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities and manufacturing start up 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with the united states market launch of the ncp system and  to a lesser extent  in connection with efforts to expand our presence in international markets 
we have not been profitable to date  and we expect to remain unprofitable through at least calendar for the period from inception through june   we incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
moreover  we expect to continue to devote considerable financial resources to sales  marketing  administration and clinical programs through fiscal in an effort to promote market awareness and acceptance of the ncp system  establish corporate infrastructure and develop applications for the ncp system 
we expect that there will be delays between the initiation of higher spending levels and increased revenues that may result from this increased spending 
moreover  once initiated  many of these expenses will be fixed in nature 
as a result  if revenues do not increase substantially over the levels achieved in recent periods  we will continue to experience substantial operating losses  potentially at levels exceeding the levels experienced in recent periods  and the point at which we achieve profitability would be delayed beyond the current expectations of securities analysts 
furthermore  even if the levels of revenues increase substantially  we may still not achieve profitability when expected to do so or at all 
even if we become profitable  we may not be able to remain so in future periods 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended june  increased to million from million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
international sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  while domestic sales were million  million and  in the respective periods 
the doubling of net sales in fiscal is primarily due to growth in the united states market 
prior to receiving fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states in july  the substantial majority of sales were derived from international markets where we had regulatory approval to sell the ncp system 
domestic sales in were limited exclusively to reimbursements related to our clinical trial activities 
sales in increased significantly due to the fda approval and resulting us launch of the ncp system 
while we expect to conduct additional clinical trial activities in the united states and internationally and may seek reimbursement in connection with these studies  we do not expect reimbursement amounts to be significant in future periods 
future increases in net sales will depend upon increased market acceptance for the ncp system and upon expanding our reimbursement from third party payors 
we are devoting substantial resources to increasing the awareness and market acceptance of the ncp system  particularly in the united states 
we believe  however  that there will be delays between sales and marketing activities and any resulting increase in sales 
furthermore  we expect to achieve lower  if any  quarter to quarter revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal than experienced in recent quarters 
we also cannot assure you that sales levels in subsequent periods will increase at the rates experienced in recent periods or at all 
gross profit 
cost of sales consist primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
our gross margin was for the year ended june   compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal is attributable primarily to the increase in net sales in the united states  which have higher gross margins than net sales in international markets 
we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate of approximately of net sales in future periods 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between direct and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the ncp system s selling price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  during the year ended june   as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal and million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in the absolute dollars of selling  general and administrative expenses in each year compared to the prior year was primarily due to sales and marketing activities focused on the united states market launch for the ncp system and to a lesser extent to the continued expansion of corporate infrastructure in response to the recent business expansion and movement of our headquarters to a new location 
we began expanding our sales and marketing staff in late calendar to more actively pursue international sales and in early in anticipation of fda approval and commercial sales activities in the united states 
by the end of fiscal  we had over sales and marketing personnel up from at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal we also expect to continue to add administrative personnel in response to the recent and potential future business expansion  although at a much lower rate than fiscal furthermore  we expect improvements in spending efficiencies which should reduce the rate of the year to year increase in future selling  general and administrative expenses as compared to the year to year increase experienced during fiscal however  we cannot assure you that we will achieve spending efficiencies or that selling  general and administrative expenses will not  in fact  continue to increase at a faster rate in fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of both expenses related to our product and process development efforts  design efforts and expenses associated with conducting clinical trials and related regulatory activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  during the year ended june   compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal and million  or of net sales  during fiscal the decrease in research and development spending in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of improved absorption of production costs during fiscal this offsets additional costs associated with heightened levels of product design and development activity  manufacturing process improvement efforts and expanded clinical and regulatory activity 
the increase in research and development spending in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects heightened levels of product design and development activity  manufacturing process improvement efforts and increased clinical and regulatory staffing in preparation for future clinical study activities 
the significant decrease in these expenses as a percent of sales in each year is primarily the result of the increase in sales for the same periods 
we intend to conduct further clinical trials of the ncp system for additional indications both within and outside the field of epilepsy 
accordingly  we expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods depending primarily upon the level and timing of our clinical trial activity 
interest income  net 
net interest income totaled million  million and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of lower average cash and investment balances on hand 
interest income increased from fiscal to fiscal due to investment of the proceeds from a private placement of common stock completed in march and from our follow on public equity offering completed in october we expect interest and other income to gradually decline in absolute dollars in future periods as we utilize our resources to fund future working capital requirements 
other expense income  net 
other income expense totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
for each of these years  other income expense consisted primarily of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
we expect other income expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon the mix between international and domestic business activities and upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire during the years through  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which expire during the years through due to our net operating loss history  to date we have established a valuation allowance to fully offset our deferred tax assets  including those related to our carryforwards  resulting in no income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
current federal income tax regulations with respect to changes in ownership could limit the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our securities 
we had no short or long term borrowings outstanding at june   and had no credit facilities available at that time 
during fiscal  we used approximately million in cash in operating activities 
during the fiscal year  inventories increased to million at june  from million at june  as we built inventory levels in support of higher levels of manufacturing and sales volume 
we also used approximately million to purchase capital equipment for our administrative and expanded manufacturing facility 
we received proceeds of approximately million and million in and  respectively  related to the issuance of our shares in the form of stock options 
during fiscal  we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a public equity offering 
our liquidity will continue to be reduced as amounts are expended to support continued growth in sales and manufacturing  continuing clinical trials and related regulatory affairs  product and process development and infrastructure development 
although we have no firm commitments  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities and to enhance general infrastructure and facilities 
we believe that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through june   although there can be no assurance of this as this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  which may not hold true 
the availability of financing either before or after that time will depend upon a number of important factors  including the state of the united states capital markets and economy in general and the health care and medical device segments in particular  the status of our international and domestic sales activities and the status of our clinical and regulatory activities 
we may not be able to raise additional capital when needed on terms favorable to us 
impact of new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
impact of year many currently installed computer systems and software products were coded using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result these computer systems and software products have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  to send invoices  or to engage in similar normal business activities 
some computers may also not properly roll from year to year  resulting instead with arbitrary dates such as january  finally  computer systems and software products may fail to process accurately the leap year logic associated with the year state of readiness and contingency plans we believe that the adverse impact of year issues on our internal computer systems will not be material 
most of the personal computers and computer systems we use have been installed in the past three years as we have been growing our organization 
we have also moved the remainder of our organization to a new facility in houston  texas  and have installed new equipment in connection with the relocation 
we recently initiated a comprehensive review of all of our equipment and software  and found the incidence potential of year issues to be minimal but not non existent 
we are in the process of defining and resolving all year issues  which we expect to complete by the end of november we have also contacted each of our key material vendors and suppliers to determine if they have any year compliance issues that have not been resolved  or may not be resolved in a timely manner 
the results of these inquiries will lead into supplier contingency planning efforts during the last quarter of calendar additionally  we recently contacted our major customers and informed them of our year readiness plans and processes 
all of our products are fully year compliant with the exception of the programming software  which does not use dating in its processing calculations  but does use dating in its reporting functions 
these reporting functions include a few non therapy related reports that may produce more information than expected when database dates span the millennium 
these reports in no way affect the programming of the implanted device  and are easily interpreted by users of the programming system 
as such  the programming software has been designated year ready  and no software updates are planned to address the small anomalies 
in the past  we have  as a service to our customers  provided laptop computers which may be used to host the ncp system programming software 
a variety of computer models have been shipped over several years  some of which are not compliant 
during the last calendar quarter of  we intend to initiate a program to communicate to our customers how they may test their laptops to determine their compliance state  and how they may reset internal dates or upgrade them if necessary 
we plan to have an independent assessment of our year plans  progress and documentation early in the last quarter of calendar the results of this independent assessment will be used to identify any remaining issues and assign resources as needed to ensure our readiness 
costs of year compliance we do not expect expenditures for upgrades and testing for year issues of software used on internal systems to be material 
to date  any such costs incurred have been in connection with the implementation of systems at our new facility and the purchase of equipment and software for our growing employee base 
we estimate that we may need to upgrade some of our manufacturing databases and replace a small number of our older pieces of manufacturing test equipment 
the costs of such activities are estimated to be under  including the independent assessment of our year program 
we expect to complete our testing  and any required upgrades by early fourth quarter calendar we also do not expect diversion of resources from other management information systems or manufacturing projects to significantly harm our business 
risks of year non compliance and contingency plans in the event of a failure of any software or other electronic devices used for our internal systems  we believe any resulting business disruption would not significantly impact our business because we believe alternative  less technologically advanced  systems are available 
the costs of the modifications and the date on which we believe we will complete the year modifications  if any  are based on management s estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  we cannot assure you that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this section and in the section of this annual report on form k entitled business  the following additional factors could effect our future results 
we rely on only one product for our revenues and if sales of this product are not achieved  our operating results will be severely harmed 
we have only one product  the ncp system  which has been approved by the fda only for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
we do not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the ncp system in the united states for at least the next three years 
although sales of our ncp system have been increasing  we cannot assure you that sales will continue to increase at the same rate or at all 
we are currently requesting approval for the use of the ncp system for the treatment of major depression in patients with unipolar and bipolar depressive disorder 
we do not yet have approvals necessary to commercialize the ncp system for the treatment of depression 
we cannot assure you that any approvals for the treatment of depression with the ncp system will be granted  nor can we assure you that even if the approval is granted  we will be successful in commercializing the ncp system for the treatment of depression or any other indications 
our inability to commercialize successfully the ncp system will severely harm our business 
we may not achieve market acceptance of the use of our ncp system to treat epilepsy  which could cause our sales to decrease 
continued market acceptance of our ncp system will depend on our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the ncp system 
while the ncp system has been used in approximately  patients through june   many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing antiepileptic drugs and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the ncp system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the ncp system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
we cannot assure you that the ncp system will achieve market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication 
failure of the ncp system to gain market acceptance would severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of security analysts 
if so  the market price of our shares may decline 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the extent to which our ncp system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for our ncp system for other indications  the timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payors  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts and the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which may depend on our ability to forecast sales 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if our expenses were not accompanied by increased sales  our results of operations and financial condition for any particular quarter would be harmed 
we may be unable to obtain adequate third party reimbursement on our product 
our ability to commercialize the ncp system successfully depends in part on whether third party payors  including private health care insurers  managed care plans  the united states government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the ncp system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the ncp system and the related services we have in the united states or internationally 
if we fail to achieve or expand favorable coverage decisions for the ncp system in a timely manner  patients and their physicians could be deterred from using the ncp system which could reduce our sales and severely harm our business 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
we have only recently expanded our marketing and sales force for the united states market  and we cannot assure you that this expanded direct marketing and sales force will succeed in promoting the ncp system to patients  health care providers or third party payors on a broad basis 
in addition  due to limited market awareness of the ncp system  we believe that the sales process could be lengthy  requiring us to continue to educate patients  health care providers and third party payors regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the ncp system 
in certain international territories  we rely  and intend to continue to rely  upon independent distributors 
we may not be able to recruit and retain skilled marketing and sales personnel or foreign distributors to support our marketing and sales efforts 
our failure to successfully market and sell our ncp system would severely impair our sales and our business 
we have limited manufacturing experience and may not be able to ramp up our manufacturing to meet anticipated product demand 
our manufacturing activities to date have consisted primarily of manufacturing limited quantities of the ncp system for clinical investigations  for two years of commercial sales activities in the united states and for commercial sales activities in international markets 
we do not have experience manufacturing the ncp system in the volumes that will be necessary to achieve significant commercial sales 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of the ncp system  in procuring the necessary supply of materials  components and contract services  or in hiring and training additional manufacturing personnel to support domestic and international demand 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities must continue to comply with the fda s qsr and with iso and standards  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements with respect to device design  development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
if we are unable to achieve commercial scale production capability on a timely basis with acceptable quality and manufacturing yield and costs  to sustain such capacity  or to maintain fda and other governmental approvals  our ability to deliver products on a timely basis could be impaired which could severely harm our business 
if our sole suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the ncp system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the ncp system  when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may be found to have significant defects that could harm the human body and result in product recalls 
the ncp system includes a complex electronic device and lead designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping errors or design defects could result in an unsafe condition in patients 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring removal and potentially reimplantation of the ncp system or a component of the ncp system 
for example  in  a failure of an ncp system caused permanent paralysis of one patient s left vocal cord 
in addition  several patients experienced bipolar lead failures which  although not harmful to the patient  reduced the efficacy of the treatment and required lead replacement 
since the occurrence of these failures  changes have been made to our product designs and no similar failures have been reported 
however in the future  we may experience similar or other product problems or may be required to recall products 
any product recall could severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the ncp system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming and we cannot assure you that patents will issue from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology  or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed united states patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
we may have to engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the ncp system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future antiepileptic drugs will continue to be the primary competition for our ncp system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel antiepileptic drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the ncp system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our ability to maintain our costs or capture new business could suffer 
in connection with the commercialization of the ncp system in the united states  we have begun and intend to continue to significantly expand the scope of our operations  in particular in manufacturing and in marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to effectively manage such growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our success will also depend upon the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business would suffer 
we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
as an implantable medical device  the manufacture and sale of the ncp system entails the risk of product liability claims 
our product liability coverage may not be adequate to cover any of these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the ncp system are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the united states by federal agencies  primarily the fda  and by comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other applications of the ncp system and for modified or future generation products 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals  or recalls of the ncp system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the united states 
we have recently begun to focus our marketing and sales activities in international markets 
we may not be successful in increasing our international market sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the ncp system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions
