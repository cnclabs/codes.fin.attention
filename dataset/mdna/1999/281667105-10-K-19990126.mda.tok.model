item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business factors affecting the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
overview jd edwards develops  markets and supports highly functional enterprise resource planning erp software for managing the supply chain 
the company provides the core software products to run an entire business 
these software solutions operate on multiple computing platforms and are designed to deliver the solutions that organizations need to maintain control of their businesses as circumstances  technologies and market environments change 
the company released the oneworld version of its application suites in late calendar to take advantage of potential opportunities in the windows nt and unix markets  as well as to enhance its position as a leader in the as market 
the company s software application suites had historically been designed to operate exclusively on certain mid range computing platforms  most recently the ibm as platform 
the worldsoftware version of application suites for use on the as platform first shipped in  and sales of such applications and related services accounted for substantially all of the company s revenue until the most recent two fiscal years 
the company licenses software under non cancelable license agreements and provides related services  including consulting  implementation  support and training 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
consulting  implementation and training services are not essential to the functionality of the company s software products  are separately priced and are available from a number of suppliers 
accordingly  revenue from these services is recorded separately from the license fee 
license fee revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  collection is probable and all significant contractual obligations relating to this license have been satisfied 
revenue on all software license transactions in which there are significant outstanding obligations is deferred and recognized once such obligations are fulfilled 
typically  the company s software licenses do not include significant post delivery obligations to be fulfilled by the company and payments are due within a twelve month period from date of delivery 
where software license contracts call for payment terms in excess of twelve months from date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
revenue from consulting  implementation and training services is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from agreements for supporting and providing periodic upgrades to the licensed software is recorded as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably over the support service period  and includes a portion of the related license fee equal to the fair value of any bundled support services 
the company does not require collateral for its receivables and reserves are maintained for potential losses 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued sop  software revenue recognition  which provides guidance on recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes sop further guidance was published during in sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
additionally  the aicpa issued technical questions and answers on financial accounting and reporting issues related to sop in january the company will apply the provisions of sop on a prospective basis for new software transactions entered into beginning in the first quarter of fiscal management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations and will not have a significant impact on its current licensing or revenue recognition practices 
however  comprehensive interpretations and commonly accepted business practices for these statements have not yet been established 
there can be no assurance that additional guidance and commonly accepted business practices pertaining to the new standards will not result in unexpected modifications to the company s current revenue recognition practices which could materially adversely impact the company s license fee revenue  results of operations and net income 
the company distributes its products and services through both direct and indirect sales channels 
currently  the company has direct sales and consulting offices located throughout the world 
the company also utilizes more than outside sales and consulting partners with offices throughout the world as an indirect distribution channel to penetrate certain vertical markets or geographic areas 
generally  operating margins are higher on domestic revenue than on international revenue 
additionally  operating margins are generally higher in the geographic areas where the company s operations are more established than in the geographic areas where the company is investing new resources 
international revenue as a percentage of total revenue ranged between and for each of the past three fiscal years 
total revenue from both license fees and services has increased from year to year 
as a percentage of total revenue  service revenue is higher than license revenue primarily as a result of the company s historical emphasis on providing consulting and training services that complement its software products and due to increased support revenue from the company s growing installed base of customers 
a change in the mix between license fee and service revenue could impact operating income as the gross margins on license fee revenue are generally higher than gross margins on service revenue 
the revenue mix may change in future periods depending upon a number of factors  particularly the company s success in penetrating the windows nt and unix markets with the oneworld version of its application suites and in its implementation strategy for oneworld 
the company has historically subcontracted a substantial portion of its consulting and training services to third parties 
such subcontracted services accounted for  and of this service revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
currently  the company is also pursuing a strategy of relying on third party implementation providers to contract directly with its customers for oneworld implementations and related services 
see item business third party implementation providers 
to the extent the company is successful in implementing this strategy and the oneworld version of the company s application suites achieves increased market acceptance in future periods  revenue from subcontracted services and total service revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely decrease 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its strategy or that such products will achieve substantial market acceptance 
the company has reassessed  and continues to closely monitor  its international business risks due to the deterioration of global economic conditions in the asian markets  particularly in japan  and in certain other geographic regions 
although the company expects that the current worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact its business to some degree  management does not believe such an impact will be material primarily due to the broad geographic diversity of its operations 
the company plans to continue to make investments in certain international areas as such opportunities are deemed appropriate and are consistent with the company s overall growth strategies 
consistent with its historical results  the company expects that during fiscal it will continue to recognize a small percentage of its revenue and operating income from asia and other specific geographic areas that are currently being impacted by adverse economic conditions 
the company does not anticipate material changes in its projections of future revenue or operating income as a result of its international operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the current economic conditions in asia or other geographic areas will not worsen or that the situation will not have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  a high degree of seasonality  with a disproportionately greater amount of its revenue and an even greater proportion of net income for any fiscal year being recognized in its fourth fiscal quarter 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized of total revenue  of license fee revenue  of service revenue and of net income 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  the company s operating margins have historically been significantly higher in its fourth fiscal quarter than in its other quarters 
the company believes that such seasonality is primarily the result of both the efforts of the company s direct sales force to meet or exceed fiscal year end sales quotas and the tendency of certain customers to finalize sales contracts at or near the company s fiscal year end 
because total revenue  operating margins and net income are greater in the fourth quarter  any shortfall from anticipated revenue  particularly license fee revenue  in the fourth quarter would have a disproportionately large adverse effect on the company s operating results for the fiscal year 
the company s first quarter revenue has historically slowed during the holiday season in november and december  and its total revenue  license fee revenue  service revenue and net income in its first fiscal quarter have historically been lower than those in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
for example  total revenue  license fee revenue  service revenue and net income in the first quarter of fiscal decreased   and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of fiscal historically  the sales cycle typically ranged between and months 
during fiscal  the company experienced a shortening of the software sales cycle and the company s sales force closed more transactions within a time period toward the shorter end of this range 
additionally there is increasing uncertainty in the erp market attributed to a number of factors including global economic conditions  issues surrounding the year and strong competitive forces which could reduce the growth in the company s license fee revenue 
due to these factors the company is experiencing reduced visibility of future revenue and operating results 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company s future license fee revenue and operating results will not be adversely affected by these factors or that its financial condition  results of operations and market price of the company s common stock will not be adversely impacted

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue except for gross margin data year ended october  revenue license fees services total revenue costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total costs and expenses operating income other income expense  net

total revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of 
the company has achieved a greater acceptance of its software products by mid sized organizations in key domestic and international markets 
additionally  new releases of the company s application suites  and enhanced services  support and custom programming capabilities have further increased such acceptance 
the total revenue increase in fiscal was due to growth in both software license transactions and services  with higher growth in license fees than services 
the revenue mix between license fees and services was and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for fiscal the company is pursuing a strategy to change its revenue mix by achieving greater license fee growth compared to services 
the company increased the number of large license transactions and the number of new customers as compared to fiscal  expanding its installed base of customers by compared to the end of last fiscal year to approximately  at october  additionally  the company is continuing with a strategy of relying on third parties to contract directly with the company s customers for oneworld implementations and related services which may affect the revenue mix in future periods 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing this strategy or that oneworld will achieve substantial market acceptance 
geographically  the overall growth was led by strong performance in europe  the middle east and africa emea  with a increase in total revenue during fiscal compared to last year 
the geographic areas defined as united states  emea and the rest of the world accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively  for fiscal comparatively  during fiscal  the united states  emea and the rest of the world accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
license fees 
license fee revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of 
the growth was primarily due to increases in the volume of license transactions  the number of new customers added during the year  and the number of large license transactions 
the oneworld version of application suites expanded the company s target market to include customers using windows nt and unix platforms in addition to those using the as platform 
the portion of license fee revenue generated from customers using either windows nt or unix platforms increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company expects that an increasing portion of the company s future license fee revenue will be generated from customers using windows nt or unix platforms compared to the previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  the company expanded several sales channel opportunities in an effort to increase license revenue generated through indirect sales channels in future periods 
in addition to other international relationships  the company s genesis distribution channel  which is focused on companies with annual revenue of less than million  expanded to also include international partners 
a new distribution channel  the small business solution  was established to focus on companies with annual revenue of less than million 
also  the company began partnering with other established software development vendors in key niche markets to focus on expansion outside the traditional erp market 
services 
service revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of 
the company continued to experience increased demand for services in fiscal compared to last year 
the increase in total service revenue was led by higher revenue from consulting  the largest component of services  although training and support revenue also increased 
consulting revenue increased primarily due to the increase in license transactions and the demand for implementations as well as the expanded capacity from both internal personnel and business partner resources 
support revenue increased primarily as a result of the company s growing installed base of customers 
training revenue increased primarily due to the increase in license transactions  expanded capacity  additional personnel resources and an increase in prices for certain courses 
as a percentage of total revenue  services revenue remained higher than license fee revenue due to the continued increases in demand and the company s ongoing commitment to provide consulting and training services that complement its software products 
in any fiscal year  total service revenue is dependent upon license transactions closed during the current and preceding quarters  the growth in the company s installed base of customers  the amount and size of consulting engagements  the number of company and business partner consultants available to staff engagements  the number of customers who have contracted for support and the amount of the related fees  billing rates for consulting services and training courses  and number of customers attending training courses 
the company subcontracts a portion of its consulting and training services to third parties 
the portion of such service revenue generated through subcontracted work accounted for in fiscal compared to in fiscal in addition to subcontracting out some of its service work to business partners  the company put a strategy in place during the previous fiscal year to utilize third parties to contract directly with its customers to implement the oneworld version of its applications suites 
during fiscal  new business alliances were established to achieve this objective  and several existing alliance partners provided significantly more resources to implement oneworld  however  to date the company has referred only a limited number of its implementations to such third parties 
the transition to this referral strategy had a limited impact on the fiscal results due to direct service contracts currently in place and established relationships with existing customers 
to the extent the company is successful in establishing this strategy  consulting revenue as a percentage of total revenue is likely to gradually decrease as compared to the previous fiscal year 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its strategy or that oneworld will achieve substantial market acceptance 
cost of license fees 
cost of license fees includes royalties  business partner commissions  amortization of capitalized software development costs  documentation costs and software delivery expenses 
cost of license fees increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of costs in fiscal compared to last fiscal year was primarily due to the volume of license transactions closed through business partners  resulting in higher commissions to the business partners 
in future periods  business partner costs may represent a larger percentage of revenue compared to the previous year if the company is successful with its expanded sales channel initiatives and business alliances that would drive an increase in expense 
the overall increase in costs compared to fiscal were partially offset by the company s renegotiation of certain royalty agreements effective in fiscal which lowered royalty expense in the current year compared to last year 
amortization of capitalized software development costs was relatively consistent at million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal capitalized software costs primarily relate to the oneworld applications and will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal the gross margin on license fee revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin on license fee revenue varies from quarter to quarter depending upon the revenue volume in relation to certain fixed costs such as the amortization of software development costs  the volume of license transactions closed through business partners  internal terms  and the proportion of the company s software products that are subject to royalty payments 
the fiscal results were positively impacted by the overall increase in license fee revenue volume and lower royalty expense on complementary third party software products licensed through the company in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of services 
cost of services includes the personnel and related overhead costs for consulting  implementation  support and training services  together with fees paid to third parties for subcontracted services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the dollar amount increase was primarily due to additional personnel and subcontracted service costs to support the growth in demand for implementation and consulting services as well as an increase in customer support staff 
during fiscal  the company invested additional resources for training its personnel and business partners on the oneworld applications and related computer platforms 
as a result  the gross margin on service revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal generally  the gross margin on support revenue is higher than on consulting and training revenue  and any change in the mix in types of services will affect the gross margin on total service revenue 
in particular  the extent to which the company is successful in implementing its strategy of relying on third parties to contract directly with the company s customers for oneworld implementations and related services will affect gross margin on service revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and related overhead costs  including commissions  for the sales and marketing activities of the company  together with advertising and promotion costs 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
increased license fee revenue impacted sales and marketing expenses during fiscal by driving higher sales commission expense as compared to fiscal the increase in the total dollar amount of expense was also the result of additional personnel and increased advertising and promotion costs for the company s expanded publicity activities 
the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased at october  compared to a year ago 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased primarily as a result of outside costs associated with the company s marketing  promotion  and advertising placement activity in fiscal as compared to last year 
the company expects to continue recruiting additional direct sales personnel in relation to the company s future sales goals and the windows nt and unix market opportunities with the oneworld version of its application suites 
additional personnel may also be required to support the company s marketing and promotion efforts 
as a result  future compensation and other related costs are expected to increase 
additionally  sales and marketing expenses may continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue in future periods as a result of the company s anticipated growth and potential timing differences between the anticipated revenue growth in relation to the additional expense from the new sales personnel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for the support and administration functions of the company 
general and administrative expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the total dollar amount of expense was higher in fiscal primarily due to an increase in personnel and subcontracted services to facilitate the growth in the company s operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined primarily as a result of the growth in revenue volume and increased efficiencies within support functions to effectively manage the overall growth in the company s operations 
the growth in support personnel was less than planned as of october   and general and administrative expenses are likely to increase at a rate more comparable to the overall growth of the company in subsequent periods 
as a result  future general and administrative expenses are not expected to continue to decline substantially as a percentage of total revenue in future fiscal years as compared to fiscal research and development 
research and development expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for product development  enhancements  upgrades  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal in addition  no software development costs were capitalized in fiscal while million was capitalized in fiscal total research and development expenditures were higher in fiscal primarily due to a increase in personnel  together with increases in related facilities and equipment costs 
development resources were primarily devoted to enhancements of both the company s world and oneworld application suites during both fiscal and capitalized software development costs in fiscal primarily consisted of oneworld development costs which the company ceased capitalizing during the first half of fiscal following the release of the version in late calendar as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenditures  including capitalized software development costs in fiscal  were relatively consistent at in fiscal and in fiscal the company anticipates that research and development expense will increase in subsequent periods 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest income on cash  cash equivalents and investments  interest expense on the company s financing arrangements and its bank line of credit  foreign currency gains and losses  and other non operating income and expenses 
interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to interest earned on the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in september foreign currency losses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies 
during late fiscal  the company broadened its foreign exchange hedging activities to help offset the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
such hedging activities cannot completely protect the company from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which the company conducts business  the volatility of currency rates  and the constantly changing currency exposures 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
the company uses hedging instruments to mitigate certain currency risk of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
the primary hedging instruments are forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of generally three months or less in term  and all contracts are entered into with major financial institutions 
gains and losses on these contracts are recognized as other income or expense in the current period  consistent with the period in which the gain or loss of the underlying transaction is recognized 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows

international revenue as a percentage of total revenue was of total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal license fees 
license fee revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of

services 
service revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to higher revenue from consulting  which is the largest component of services  although support and training revenue also increased 
total service revenue is dependent upon the amount and size of consulting engagements  the number of company and business partner consultants available to staff engagements  the number of customers who have contracted for support and the amount of the related fees  billing rates for consulting services and training courses  and average training course sizes 
service revenue as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the consistent demand for services resulted from the company s emphasis on providing consulting and training services that complement its software products and the growth in its installed base of customers 
cost of license fees 
cost of license fees increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin on license fee revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily as a result of lower royalty expense on complementary third party software products licensed through the company in fiscal compared to fiscal amortization of capitalized software development costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was the result of the amortization of capitalized oneworld development costs  which began upon the release of the oneworld version of the company s application suites in late calendar gross margin on license fee revenue varies  in part  depending upon the proportion of the company s software products that are subject to royalty payments 
the company offers certain complementary software products that are subject to royalties payable by the company to third parties 
license fees subject to royalties were lower during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to declining license fee revenue from application suites incorporating worldvision  a graphical user interface for worldsoftware that utilizes technology licensed from third parties  as more of the company s customers seeking such functionality during the later part of fiscal chose to purchase oneworld 
also affecting license fee margins in fiscal was an increase in business partner commissions from fiscal due primarily to an increase in license fee revenue from the company s genesis version of its application suites  which is offered exclusively through business partners 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was due to increased personnel and subcontracted services to support the growing demand for implementation and consulting services 
gross margin on service revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to lower compensation costs as a percentage of the related revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of the addition of direct sales personnel necessary to support the company s selling efforts  especially the oneworld version of its application suites

general and administrative expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
total dollar amount of expense was higher in fiscal primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the growth in the company s operations 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal in addition  capitalized software development costs were million for fiscal  down from million for fiscal total research and development expenditures  including the capitalized software development costs  were higher in fiscal primarily due to a increase in personnel  together with increases in related facilities and equipment costs

income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income gross margin on license fee revenue gross margin on service revenue in the last eight quarters  expenses and operating income as a percentage of total revenue have varied primarily due to seasonality  which has resulted in disproportionately higher license fee revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter 
expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased in the fourth quarter due to seasonally higher license fee revenue 
gross margin on license fee revenue has varied quarterly from to within the last eight quarters due to fluctuations in license volume and the mix of fixed and variable costs of licenses 
gross margin on service revenue has declined moderately primarily due to the investment in resources for training personnel and business partners on oneworld applications and has decreased in the first quarters of fiscal and fiscal due to lower service revenue during the holiday season in november and december 
based on all of the foregoing  the company believes that future revenue  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
furthermore  the company believes it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to the company s business or generally  the market price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term and long term investments and a million  unsecured  revolving line of credit which can be utilized for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of october   the company had working capital of million and no amounts were outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
short term deferred revenue and customer deposits totaling million are included in determining this amount 
the short term deferred revenue primarily represents annual support payments billed to customers that is recognized ratably as revenue over the support service period 
without the short term deferred revenue and customer deposits  working capital would have been million  and including short term and long term investments working capital would have been million 
the company calculates accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso by dividing its accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the sum of revenue for the quarter plus the net change in unearned revenue divided by days 
the net change in unearned revenue is included in the calculation to better reflect sales activity timing rather than revenue recognition timing 
calculated as such  dso was days as of october  compared to days as of the previous fiscal year end 
the company s dso can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors  including the concentration of transactions that occur toward the end of each quarter and the variability of quarterly operating results 
see factors affecting the company s business  operating results and financial condition quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
the company generated operating cash flow of million for fiscal and million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in operating cash flow from year to year were due primarily to increased net income 
during these periods  growth in operating assets such as accounts receivable has been funded by similar growth in operating liabilities  primarily deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
tax deductions associated with stock option exercises during fiscal increased the deferred income tax asset and additional paid in capital in the balance sheet as of october  the company utilized cash for investing activities of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increased net levels in fiscal and were due to the investment of cash from the initial public offering 
during each of these fiscal years  the company purchased furniture  fixtures and equipment that were necessary to support its expanding operations 
in fiscal and  the company s cash utilized for investing activities was offset in part by million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the sale of assets 
in fiscal  the company invested million to purchase land in denver  colorado  a portion of which is being used by the company for a headquarters facility 
financing activities provided million in cash from exercises of common stock options and the employee stock purchase plan activity 
the company issued a total of million shares of common stock during fiscal in september  the company completed its initial public offering of million shares of common stock  of which million were issued by the company  generating net proceeds of million 
additionally  during fiscal  the company issued  shares of common stock upon the exercise of options and received million in proceeds 
the company did not have other significant net financing activities for fiscal   or the company utilized its bank line of credit for working capital and other general corporate purposes during fiscal and but repaid all amounts borrowed within each of these periods 
management believes its cash and cash equivalents balance  short term and long term investments  amounts available under existing credit facilities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
additionally  the company may also use a portion of its short and long term investments to acquire businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to those of the company or to acquire treasury stock 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  in which case the company may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to the company and would not result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
impact of the year issue the year issue is a result of computer systems and other electronic equipment using processors or embedded chips which use only two digit entries in the date code field and may not be able to distinguish whether means or the potential for system errors and failures involves all aspects of the company s operations  including computer systems  voice and data networks and the infrastructure of its facilities 
to address the company wide internal year readiness activities  the company established a corporate readiness program during fiscal to coordinate efforts already underway in the information technology it and software development departments and to expand the program to include all business functions and geographic areas 
the program is addressing internal operational and financial risks as well as those associated with business partners and other third parties 
status reports on this program are presented to the company s senior management and to the audit committee of the board of directors periodically 
state of readiness 
the company s business operations are significantly dependent upon the proprietary software products it licenses to customers 
management believes it has already successfully addressed the year issues in the current versions of its proprietary software products and does not anticipate any business interruptions associated with these applications 
certain custom software applications used internally are not yet year ready  and the company plans to finish the programming of needed revisions  testing and implementation by its fourth quarter in fiscal an internal upgrade to product versions of third party software that are year ready is also expected to be completed by its fourth quarter in fiscal the company is working with all service providers to protect its operations from the potential effects of a third party failing to become year ready  and the company has been encouraging its customers to migrate to current product versions that are year ready 
the following six step process is being followed to assess the company s internal state of readiness and to direct preparations for the year awareness make all levels of the organization aware of year issues 
inventory obtain complete detailed lists of specific issues from representatives in every area of the company s business 
assessment complete a detailed inventory review to determine and prioritize areas of exposure  identify mission critical processes and systems  initiate certification of year compliance for vendors suppliers landlords  establish contingency plans 
resolution decide which systems to replace  retrofit or retire  initiate conversion to systems that are year ready 
testing obtain assurance that conversions were completed properly and that the systems and processes will function correctly  implement contingency plans 
deployment implement modified systems and processes back into normal production  monitor contingency plans 
overall  the company had accomplished a completion of its readiness process to date  excluding any issues related to the current versions of its proprietary software products which management believes to be generally year compliant 
the company had finished the first three steps of the process and had completed of the resolution phase in its readiness of it systems 
in relation to its state of readiness for non it areas and issues related to third parties with which the company has a material relationship  the company had completed the awareness and inventory phases and was complete with the assessment phase 
management expects to be substantially year ready company wide no later than december costs 
the company estimates the direct costs to remediate year issues will total million and does not anticipate such costs will have a material impact on its results of operations 
such costs include the budget for the company s corporate readiness programs  it and non it costs  legal expenses  and expenses associated with a field readiness task force and equipment purchases 
such costs do not include an estimate for labor  overhead or other resources that are associated with the impact of year compliance but are not directly involved in the project 
to date  the direct costs incurred to remediate year issues were less than  risks 
failure to correct mission critical year problems could cause a serious interruption in business operations and could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the actions currently being taken are expected to significantly reduce the risks of an adverse impact 
however  due to the scope of the company s operations and the extent of year risks  it is likely that the company will not be able to eliminate all potential problems before they arise 
significant uncertainty exists in the erp software industry concerning the potential effects associated with year readiness 
management believes that customers and potential customers purchasing patterns may be affected in a number of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to upgrade their systems 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those the company offers 
additionally  it is possible that certain of our customers are purchasing support contracts only to ensure that they are year ready and then will cancel such contracts 
many potential customers may defer purchasing year ready products as long as possible  accelerate purchasing such products  switch to other systems or suppliers  or purchase the company s products only as an interim solution 
although the company currently offers software products that are designed and have been tested to be ready for the year  there can be no assurance that the company s software products contain all necessary date code changes 
furthermore  it has been widely reported that a significant amount of litigation surrounding business interruptions will arise out of year issues 
it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected by such litigation 
the company mailed information regarding the year issue along with a questionnaire to its customers in march to assist them in preparations for the century change as well as to help the company assess its customer service demands 
based upon the number of responses received and the number of customers that originally licensed recent product versions  the company estimated that over of its customer base is currently operating with a version of its software applications that is year ready 
however  the company could be faced with an inability to meet the demand for services to upgrade its existing installed base of customers or to meet increased demand from potential customers who still need to address their year issues 
factors outside the company s control could also cause significant disruptions of business activities and affect the company s ability to be ready for the year such as the failure of its third party business partners  suppliers  government entities  customers  and others to adequately prepare 
additionally  third party software and computer technology used internally may materially impact the company if not year compliant 
the company s operations may be at risk and a material adverse impact to the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could result if any third parties fail to adequately address the problem or if software conversions result in system incompatibilities with these third parties 
contingency plans 
as part of the six step process outlined above  specific contingency plans are being developed in connection with the assessment and resolution to the mission critical risks identified 
such planning is complicated by the risk of multiple year problems and the fact that many of the company s risks reside with third parties who may not successfully address their own risks 
however  the company has currently established certain contingency plans for both it and non it systems  and it is continuing to develop such plans regarding all its specific mission critical functions 
such plans include backup power generators for the company s facilities  explicit manual workaround procedures and the identification of key contacts worldwide who will be responsible for addressing specific issues and implementing such plans 
euro in january  a new currency called the ecu or the euro was introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
during the next three years  business in emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
although the company currently offers software products that are designed to be euro currency enabled and management believes it will be able to accommodate any required euro currency changes  there can be no assurance that the software will contain all the necessary changes or meet all of the euro currency requirements 
if the company s software does not meet all the euro currency requirements of our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the company has not had and does not expect a material impact on its results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of its transition to the euro as the functional currency for its subsidiaries based in emu countries

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of its operations  the company is exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of the company s market risks 
foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside of the us expose the company to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
during fiscal  of the company s total revenue was generated from its international operations  and the net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries totaled of consolidated net assets as of october  the company s exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which it conducts business 
the company operates outside the us primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  africa  asia  canada and latin america 
these foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or  more recently  the euro as their functional currency as sales are generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
such hedging activities cannot completely protect the company from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which the company conducts business  the volatility of currency rates  and the constantly changing currency exposures 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its exposures from foreign net asset and forward foreign exchange contracts as of october  and its exposure from anticipated foreign revenue in fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in foreign currency rates from the fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition for the next fiscal year 
interest rates 
investments  including cash equivalents  consist of us  state and municipal bonds  as well as domestic corporate bonds  with maturities of up to thirty months 
all investments are classified as held to maturity as defined in sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and accordingly are carried at amortized cost 
additionally  the company has lease obligations calculated as a return on the lessor s costs of funding based on libor and adjusted from time to time to reflect any changes in the company s leverage ratio 
changes in interest rates could impact the company s anticipated interest income and lease obligations or could impact the fair market value of its investments 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures and its exposure from anticipated investment and borrowing levels for fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of investments and would not materially impact the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition for the next fiscal year
