as a result  the dividends payable on these securities are reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of holdings  but are not reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of uri

fluctuations in operating results the company expects that its revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including seasonal rental patterns of the company s customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter  changes in general economic conditions in the company s markets  the timing of acquisitions and the opening of start up locations and related costs  the effect of the integration of acquired businesses and start up locations  the timing of expenditures for new equipment and the disposition of used equipment  and price changes in response to competitive factors 
the company is continually involved in the investigation and evaluation of potential acquisitions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company capitalizes certain direct out of pocket expenditures such as legal and accounting fees relating to potential or pending acquisitions 
indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
the company s policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or pending acquisition that the company determines will not be consummated 
there can be no assurance that the company in future periods will not be required to incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy  which charge  depending upon the magnitude thereof  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company will be required to incur significant start up expenses in connection with establishing each start up location 
such expenses may include  among others  pre opening expenses related to setting up the facility  and expenses in connection with training employees  installing information systems and marketing 
the company expects that  in general  start up locations will initially operate at a loss or at less than normalized profit levels 
consequently  the opening of a start up location may negatively impact the company s margins until the location achieves normalized profitability 
there may be a lag between the time that the company purchases new equipment and begins to incur the related depreciation and interest expenses and the time that the equipment begins to generate revenues at normalized rates 
as a result  the purchase of new equipment  particularly equipment purchased in connection with expanding and diversifying the company s rental equipment  may periodically reduce margins 
general economic conditions and inflation the company s operating results may be adversely affected by i changes in general economic conditions  including changes in construction and industrial activity  or increases in interest rates  or ii adverse weather conditions that may temporarily decrease construction and industrial activity in a particular geographic area 
although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  the company believes that inflation has not had  and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on its results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
we do not use  nor have we historically used  derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
interest rate risk 
all borrowings under our million credit facility bear interest at a variable rate of interest 
the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility was million as of december  our other variable rate debt primarily consists of the million term loan and a million demand note 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt as of december  were i for the credit facility  ii for the term loan and iii for the demand note 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt have remained relatively stable over the past year 
based upon the amount of variable debt that we had outstanding as of december  approximately million in the aggregate  our net income would decrease by approximately million for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility from time to time 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the current level of our canadian operations  a change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings
