general the company s fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to fiscal years of the company refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  the company s fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
the company operates two business segments a lifestyle oriented general merchandise retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business wholesale 
the retailing segment operates through retail stores and through direct response  including a catalog and a website 
the two retail concepts are urban outfitters urban retail and anthropologie 
urban retail is the larger of the two and generates most of the company s revenues and profits 
urban retail had stores open at january  and at january  the company s first anthropologie store opened in october anthropologie had stores open at january  and at january  the company has plans to open six urban retail stores and five anthropologie stores in fiscal an anthropologie catalog was tested in the first half of fiscal and  based upon the success of the test  was launched during the second half of the year 
to support the catalog  a website was established in august in response to customer requests  the site began accepting orders in december the direct response operation incurred a loss for the year  and management expects the catalog and the company s e commerce efforts to also incur a loss for fiscal fiscal and continued as profitable years for urban outfitters with earnings to net sales of and  respectively  as well as return on beginning shareholders equity of and  respectively 
the slight contraction of earnings as a percent of sales in fiscal and the reduction in return on shareholders equity in that year resulted primarily from the start up costs of the catalog effort and the decrease in sales by wholesale to unrelated entities 
the wholesale company had recorded sales growth of in fiscal the wholesale company is anticipated to grow at a modest rate in fiscal the company previously established a european subsidiary urban outfitters uk ltd 
and opened its first urban retail store in london in june the success of the london store opening enabled the subsidiary to make a small profit during fiscal results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain income statement data from period to period 
the company has revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs with cost of goods sold in order to enhance the comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
fiscal year ended january  as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of goods sold  including certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net interest and other expenses income income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period dollar growth net sales gross profit income from operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
the million increase was attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales increases of million  net sales increases of million from stores opened during fiscal and fiscal  and catalog and e commerce revenues of million  offset in part by a decrease of million from the wholesale company 
in fiscal  increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase 
eleven new stores were opened in fiscal and three new stores were opened in fiscal the wholesale sales decrease reflected lower purchases by larger retail chains  as well as customer issues regarding quality  delivery and fashion  which have been addressed by management 
gross profit margins increased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to higher initial mark ups and lower markdown percentages in the urban retail and anthropologie stores 
comparable store sales increases in existing stores offset the higher occupancy costs of noncomparable and new stores 
reduced sales in the wholesale segment necessitated an increased proportion of merchandise to be sold in the off price sector  offsetting in part  the higher retail segment performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal due to the costs incurred for the start up of the catalog and european operations as well as the substantial negative leverage associated with the decline in wholesale segment sales 
the increase in dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to the opening of additional stores as well as the catalog start up 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
the million increase was attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales decreases of million  net sales increases of million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal and fiscal and net sales increases of million from the wholesale company 
the decrease in comparable store sales of or million resulted primarily from one merchandise division that did not perform to prior year levels 
average selling prices were not a significant determinant of fiscal sales levels 
new and enlarged stores included seven stores opened in fiscal and three opened in fiscal the company believes increased net sales from the wholesale subsidiary during fiscal and fiscal were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines 
the company s gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher cost of goods sold and higher occupancy costs 
the primary contributor to the cost of goods sold increase was higher markdowns in the retail segment 
markdowns were triggered by lower than planned comparable store sales 
occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased due to the impact of new stores and the comparable store sales decline 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative costs decreased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal the increase in dollars is due to the opening of new stores during fiscal and fiscal the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to cost containment measures at store level 
liquidity and capital resources during the last three years  the company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations 
the company s primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories 
most recently  the company invested in the anthropologie direct response effort and in a new european subsidiary 
an investment has also been made in a direct response company aimed at teen shoppers see hmb publishing below 
in addition to cash generated from operations  sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in each of fiscal  and over the next few years  the company expects to incur capital expenditures in support of its expansion program 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash  including additional investments in the direct response operations 
although the company has not borrowed short term or long term funds during the last five fiscal years  it maintains a line of credit of million  all of which is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit 
the line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest upon an as offered basis not to exceed libor plus of percent 
the company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label and wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers 
outstanding balances of letters of credit at january  and were million and million  respectively 
there were no short term or long term borrowings outstanding at january  or at january  the company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for at least the next three years 
other matters year the year problem concerns the inability of information and technology based operating systems to function properly after december  this could result in system failures and miscalculations which may cause business disruptions 
the company does not generally sell products that must be brought into year compliance 
however  the company does rely upon many vendors and suppliers for their products and services  as well as utilities  financial institutions and governmental entities that provide critical services to the company and to its customers 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
based on the review  the company s major information technology systems it that would be adversely affected by year dates will be upgraded or replaced through the normal course of business prior to december  internal resources will be used in a timely manner to evaluate  modify and test the company s less critical systems that are not scheduled to be upgraded or replaced through the normal course of business 
the company s core merchandising and financial system upgrade and the store register system upgrades have been completed  testing of these upgrades is substantially completed 
in addition  the company is in the process of completing the inventory and assessment of its non information technology systems non it  including those with embedded processor chips heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems  elevators  etc 
the company has also reviewed and continues to monitor the implemented changes or planned changes of its major suppliers that management believes could be affected by year dates 
the company is evaluating key vendor preparedness by conducting interviews  obtaining compliance representation letters and  if deemed necessary  conducting comprehensive tests 
the company expects to complete its year compliance evaluation program by june  at this time  management continues to believe that the incremental costs associated with major system upgrades and or replacements  as well as internal efforts to evaluate  modify and test the company s other systems to ensure year compliance  will not be material to the company 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the company s efforts will prevent year issues from having a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the possible consequences to the company if its vendors and suppliers are not fully year compliant including the global banking systems  communications and other public utilities and the transportation industry include temporary store closings and delays in the receipt of key merchandise 
accordingly  the company is in the process of developing contingency plans to mitigate the potential disruptions that may result from the year issue 
such plans may include earlier receipt of key merchandise  preparing alternative merchandise delivery methodologies and securing alternative suppliers 
it is anticipated that these contingency plans to manage identified it and non it areas of high risk will be completed by june  there can be no guarantee  however  that any contingency plans developed by the company will prevent such material adverse effects 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
which is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt sfas no 
effective february  the company currently enters into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures related to its canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow 
the amounts of the contracts and related gains and losses have not been material 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
market risks the company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise  as well as other goods and services  the value of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar  and changes in interest rates 
due to the company s inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments  commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material 
the company purchases substantially all its merchandise in us dollars  including a portion of the goods for its stores located in canada and the united kingdom 
as explained in the section above on recent accounting pronouncements  the market risk is further limited by the company s purchase of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
since the company has not been a borrower  its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to the impact on its marketable securities portfolio 
this exposure is minimized by the limited investment maturities and put options available to the company as explained in the notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the impact of a hypothetical two percent increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
