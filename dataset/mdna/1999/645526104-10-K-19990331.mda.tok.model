 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
must be implemented by the company for the year ended december  the effects of sfas no 
on the company s financial statements are not expected to be significant 
year the issues raised by the inability of computers  software  and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a digit year are commonly referred to as year yk issues 
a company wide yk compliance program has been implemented to determine yk issues and develop strategies to assure compliance 
the compliance program has four major areas of concentration internal information technology systems  non information technology systems  systems and processes utilized by franchisees  and compliance issues related to major suppliers 
a yk project team has been established and is directing the activity regarding the issues confronted in each area  monitoring progress of the effort  and reporting findings to management 
as the yk compliance program proceeds  contingency plans will be prepared  updated  and implemented as necessary to address the risks identified 
with respect to internal information technology systems  among the most critical systems to the ongoing operations of both the company owned and franchised training centers are those systems which provide customer contact and student registration information 
the systems currently used by the company owned centers are not yk compliant  but the company has prepared the necessary upgrades 
the cost of developing these upgrades has not been  and is not expected to be  material 
certain franchised locations use the same systems as the company owned centers and have received these upgrades from the company 
other franchised locations use contact management and or student registration software from various vendors which  in many cases  may require updating to become yk compliant 
franchisees have been and will continue to be advised to bring their systems into compliance 
however  simultaneous with these efforts  the company has also engaged a third party to develop a comprehensive replacement information management system nhms for use in all company owned and franchised locations 
the company expects to commence deployment of this system  which is designed to be yk compliant  in the third quarter of in addition to the foregoing  the company is reviewing its other computer hardware and software systems and upgrading or replacing them as necessary 
with respect to the company s accounting system currently used to consolidate results from the company owned centers  the company has selected a new system 
the cost of the new system is expected to be less than installation is expected to be completed for the locations that do not have yk compliant accounting systems by the second quarter of the new system will be installed in the remaining centers by september regarding non information technology systems  the project team has inventoried the items potentially affected by yk issues  and is currently assessing compliance of those systems considered to have the potential for a material impact 
those items which appear to have the potential for such an effect that are determined not to be in compliance will be upgraded or replaced by mid those costs are not expected to be material 
the project team prepared a yk readiness compliance outline and disseminated it to franchisees at the end of the operation of a franchise is substantially similar to the operation of a company owned center  and accordingly  this report is a by product of the analysis the project team is performing on the company owned locations 
as noted above  it is believed that many franchisees have contact management and or student registration systems which are not yk compliant 
because the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from royalties received from its franchisees  the company could be materially adversely affected if the systems utilized by the franchisees are not yk compliant 
in order to minimize this exposure  which the company believes is its most reasonably likely worst case scenario  the company intends to make nhms available to franchisees in and to furnish to users of older systems  of the type used by the company  upgrades which are expected to bring these systems into yk compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that franchisees will implement nhms or the necessary system upgrades before january  as part of its yk compliance efforts  the company has initiated formal communications with suppliers providing goods or services material to the company s operations in order to determine the extent to which the company s systems and operations are vulnerable to any failure by such third parties to remediate their yk problems 
there can be no assurance  however  that the systems of those suppliers will be converted in a timely fashion and will not have an adverse effect on the company 
the lack of yk compliance on the part of a customer of a company owned or franchised center should not have a direct adverse impact on the operations of the company 
however  to the extent the costs associated with yk compliance reduces a customer s information technology training budget  the company could experience a reduction in revenues 
the company believes that the cost of the yk compliance efforts for its information and non information technology systems will not be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding yk issues  there can be no assurance that yk failures or implications  including litigation  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  or financial position  particularly in the event any significant third parties cannot in a timely manner provide the company with products  services  or systems that meet the yk requirements 
the conclusions and estimates in this yk information include forward looking statements and are based upon management s current best estimates of future events
