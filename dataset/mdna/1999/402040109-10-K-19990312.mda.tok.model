in some markets where the company has pursued its clustering strategy  there has been some transfer of sales from certain existing stores to new locations 
generally  however  mature stores have demonstrated net sales growth rates consistent with the company average 
as the company enters new markets  management expects that it will initially incur higher occupancy  administrative and advertising costs per store than it currently experiences in established markets

the company believes that there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music product retailers or by developing or acquiring mail order catalogue and internet sales businesses 
in the ordinary course of business  the company regularly considers  evaluates and enters into negotiations related to potential acquisition opportunities 
any such transactions may involve the payment by the company of cash or securities including equity securities  or a combination of the foregoing

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices or consummate any acquisition or that any current negotiations will result in an acquisition 
see item business risks related to the business we may be unable to meet our growth strategy 
management believes that the company has adequate capital resources and liquidity to meet its borrowing obligations  fund all required capital expenditures and pursue its business strategy for at least the next twelve months  including its present plans for expansion as described elsewhere herein 
the company s capital resources and liquidity are expected to be provided by the company s cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
depending on market conditions  the company may also incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities 
there can no assurance that such additional capital  if and when required  will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
income taxes the company operated as an s corporation for all reported periods prior to the closing of its recapitalization on june  accordingly  federal taxes were paid at the stockholder level and the company paid minimal state income taxes 
upon consummation of the recapitalization  the company eliminated its s corporation status and  accordingly  became subject to federal  state and local corporate income taxes 
as a result of the million loss incurred in fiscal  the company has a tax net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes aggregating million  which will expire if unused in as of december   the company had reserved of the related deferred tax asset of million 
upon finalization of the company s tax returns  substantially all of the company s state income tax net operating loss will be utilized 
consequently  state income taxes in will have to be funded through cash payments 
additionally  due to certain changes in the company s ownership structure  it is anticipated that the timing of the use of the company s federal net operating loss may be limited during this limitation affects the timing of realization of the tax benefit associated with our nol  not the amount of the ultimate benefit 
it is currently anticipated that cash payments for income taxes will be necessary in the fourth quarter of see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s results are not highly seasonal  although  as with most retailers  sales in the fourth quarter are typically higher than in other quarters 
year the year issue is primarily the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
computer programs that are date dependent are found in the software that operates many it systems as well as in the computer based devices which control many types of electronic equipment 
computer programs that are not year compliant will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to a disruption in the operation of the related it systems or electronic equipment 
in  the company established a project plan to investigate the year compliance of its internal and third party computer system applications and hardware 
the objective was to verify third party compliance and complete internal compliance prior to year end all work has been substantially completed with the exception of a major software project related to the company s inventory management system due to be implemented in april of as of the date of this annual report  the company believes that all of its significant it systems will be year compliant by the end of the company currently does not have a contingency plan with regard to the year during  the company will continue to evaluate whether and to what extent contingency arrangements should be implemented 
the company has also endeavored to assess the year compliance of the outside parties upon which it is most dependent  including large vendors of the products resold in the guitar center stores 
while the company is not aware of any material compliance difficulties expected by any such supplier  its ability to obtain accurate information is necessarily limited 
a number of the company s vendors manufacture their products overseas  also making accurate information difficult to obtain 
those vendors  as well as the company  are also dependent upon the continued normal functioning of surface and air transportation  electric utility and voice and data transmission infrastructure  and the electronic payments systems and other activities of large financial institutions 
many of these companies have very significant year compliance programs underway because they tend to be dependent on large  proprietary legacy computing systems that are particularly susceptible to year problems 
the success of these compliance programs will prove important to the company and those with which it does business 
based on the assessment efforts to date  however  the company does not believe that the year issue will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company s beliefs and expectations  however  are based on certain assumptions and expectations that ultimately may prove to be inaccurate 
the company believes that by the end of  it will be able to fully determine its most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
potential sources of risk include a the inability of principal suppliers to be year ready  which could result in delays in product deliveries from such suppliers  b disruption of the distribution channel  including ports  and transportation vendors  as a result of a general failure of systems and necessary infrastructure such as electric power supply  voice and data communications and financial payment systems  and c unexpected failures of systems or devices that are misidentified as being year compliant or which prove unexpectedly to contain non compliant  date dependent computer code 
as of the date of this annual report  the company does not expect the future costs associated with its year efforts to be substantial 
to date  the company has spent minimal resources on the year issue  as such  primarily due to an already established  long term plan to upgrade and modernize all systems which it has been implementing since the year issues have been addressed as part of the overall global system strategies 
the company s statements concerning future costs do not include time and costs that may be incurred by the company as a result of the failure of any third parties  including suppliers  to become year compliant  or costs to implement any contingency plans 
the information above contains forward looking statements which reflect the current views of the company with respect to year compliance and the related costs and possible impact on its financial performance 
as indicated above  these assessments may prove to be inaccurate 
the year problem is novel 
neither the company nor any of its suppliers is experienced at identifying and remediating a problem of this sort which represents a systemic defect that  if not corrected  will cause the failure of computer systems and computer controlled devices that are pervasive in the infrastructure of business and government 
inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a significant impact on its nets sales or profitability 
impact of recently issued pronouncements in april  the aicpa issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that costs incurred during start up activities  including organization costs and pre opening costs for new stores  be expenses as incurred 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  initial application of sop should be as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which sop is first adopted and should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company will adopt sop in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  the company will record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately  in the consolidated statement of operations for the period ending march  relative to the adoption of sop forward looking statements this annual report contains certain forward looking statements relating to  among other things  future results of operations  growth plans including  without limitation  the number and timing of new store openings  sales  gross margin and expense trends  year conversion  capital requirements and general industry and business conditions applicable to the company 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the company s current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include changes in external competitive market factors  change in the company s business strategy or an inability to execute its strategy due to unanticipated changes in the music products industry or the economy in general  the emergence of new or growing specialty retailers of music products and various competitive factors that may prevent the company from competing successfully in existing or future markets 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  many of which are described in greater detail in item business risks related to the business  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will in fact be realized
