year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in a date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year this is referred to as the year issue 
management has initiated a company wide program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for year compliance 
the company has assigned a team to monitor year compliance 
with respect to the products the company offers for sale  the company has verified that the products are year compliant 
the team is charged with ensuring year compliance for all hardware and software products through its purchasing process  as well as assessing the year readiness and risk to the company of its critical vendors and suppliers 
the team is also responsible to coordinate year compliance for its internal systems and devices 
at present  year compliance of the company s internal systems and devices is scheduled to be substantially complete by september the company expects to incur internal staff costs as well as other expenses necessary to prepare its systems for the year the company expects to both replace some systems and upgrade others 
maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred 
management estimates that the cost of this program will approximate  with approximately  representing incremental costs to the company 
the total cost effort does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the cost of internal hardware or software replaced in the normal course of business 
based upon current information and assessment  the company does not believe that the year issue as discussed above will be material to its financial position or results of operations or that its business will be adversely affected in any material respect 
nevertheless  achieving year compliance is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
should either the company s internal systems or one or more of its critical vendors or suppliers fail due to year issues  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company has evaluated the worst case scenarios in the event that its products  systems  or business partners are not year ready and has formulated contingency plans to operate 
if the company s investigations suggest that there is a significant risk that certain products  systems  or business partners might not be year ready  the company will execute its contingency plans accordingly
