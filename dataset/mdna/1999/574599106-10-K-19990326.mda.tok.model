factors which affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in the us and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction  cost management  fluctuations in european currencies primarily the german deutsche mark and british pound  the increasing importance of home centers as distributors of home improvement and building products and the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets with increasing global competition 
historically  the company has been able to largely offset cyclical declines in housing markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains 
net sales and operating profit for  aided by acquisitions  both increased percent to  million and million  respectively 
net income and diluted earnings per share for were million and  representing increases of percent and percent  respectively  over corporate development acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to masco s long term growth  even though generally the initial impact on earnings is minimal after deducting acquisition related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization 
the important earnings benefit to masco arises from subsequent growth of acquired companies  since incremental sales are not impacted by these expenses 
during  the company acquired vasco corporation and the brugman group  both of which are european manufacturers of residential hydronic radiators and heat convectors  and heritage bathrooms plc  a european manufacturer and distributor of residential bath products 
the results of operations for these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition

the junior debt securities mature in and are stated at face value  the company is recording the percent pay in kind interest income from these securities 
the company records dividend income from the percent cumulative preferred stock when such dividends are declared 
the convertible preferred stock represents transferable rights for up to a percent common ownership  although the company is restricted from maintaining an ownership in excess of percent of furnishings international s common equity 
as such  the company will not acquire additional common equity  except for purposes of resale 
profit margins operating profit margin  before general corporate expense  decreased to percent in following an increase to percent in from percent in general corporate expense includes those expenses not specifically attributable to the company s business segments 
the decrease in over is principally due to the influence of product mix and increased goodwill amortization from recent acquisitions  offset in part by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the company s operating profit margin from faucet sales is somewhat higher than that from other products offered by the company due to the simplicity  quality and reliability of its faucet mechanisms  manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities  extensive marketing and merchandising activities and breadth of product offerings

mascotech recognized a million after tax gain from the delivery to the company of the emco limited common stock 
the company s recording of equity earnings from mascotech for excludes the effect of such gain due to the related party nature of the transaction

excluding amortization of acquired goodwill million  million  and million in  and  respectively  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were percent in compared with percent and percent for and  respectively 
the downward trend in the selling  general and administrative expenses percentage results from the company s continuation of cost containment initiatives and the leveraging of fixed costs over a higher sales base

business segment results after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures  increases in net sales for the company s kitchen and bath products segment are largely due to higher unit sales volume of cabinets  faucets and other kitchen and bath products  and to a lesser extent  new product introductions and selling price increases 
operating results of this business segment for were favorably influenced by higher unit sales volume  offset in part by a moderation in gross profit margin due to the influence of product sales mix  acquisitions and stronger than anticipated demand for cabinets 
for compared with  higher unit sales volumes contributed to improved operating results of the company s us cabinet  other kitchen and bath and faucet businesses 
these improved results were offset by the weaker results of the company s european operations included in this segment and the modestly lower margins of companies acquired in after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures  increases in net sales for the company s environmental products and services segment for and principally include the influence of higher installation sales of fiberglass insulation 
operating results of the company s environmental products and services segment for were affected in part by higher fiberglass insulation costs  which offset the favorable influence of european acquisitions 
operating results for were lower due in part to plant reorganization charges 
after adjusting for acquisitions  net sales for the company s builders hardware and other specialty products segment increased in due largely to increased hardware sales 
operating profit in was adversely influenced by lower results of certain of the company s hardware businesses  which faced operational challenges and weakness in the domestic hospitality market  and lower results of european operations

operating results of the company s business segments for  and benefitted from the leveraging of fixed selling  general and administrative expenses over higher sales 
geographic area results results of north american operations for  and benefitted from acquisitions and increased sales volume of existing businesses  driven in part by favorable demographic and economic conditions principally in the united states  including complementary population trends  modest economic growth and relatively low unemployment and interest rates 
these conditions have favorably influenced the housing market in the united states  including housing starts  existing home sales and repair and remodeling activities 
european results for were favorably influenced by acquisitions 
results of existing european operations have been adversely influenced in recent years  in part due to softness in the company s european markets  competitive pricing pressures on certain products and the influence of a higher percentage of lower margin sales to total sales

the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity based instruments at december  a review of the company s other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that the company had exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
at december   the company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of these risks and concluded that near term changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
year the year yk issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems or equipment that have date sensitive software using only two digits may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the resulting system failures or miscalculations may cause disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or send and receive electronic data with third parties or engage in similar normal business activities 
in  the company formed an internal review team to address the yk issue 
this team  consisting of existing employees of the company  has developed a year compliance program the yk program which includes assessing and monitoring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on mainframe  mid range  personal computer and network platforms  addressing issues related to non information technology embedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance of key business partners 
executive management regularly monitors the status of the company s yk program 
the first component of the yk program is to identify the computer systems and other equipment with embedded technology that are susceptible to failures or errors as a result of the yk issue 
this effort is substantially complete 
the second component involves the actual remediation or replacement of non compliant systems and equipment 
for its information technology  the company generally utilizes mid range  non mainframe based computing environments which are complemented by a series of local area networks that are connected via a wide area network 
substantially all operating systems related to the mid range systems and networks have been updated to comply with yk requirements 
in addition  upgraded or modified versions of the company s financial  manufacturing  human resource  and other packaged software applications which are yk compliant are in the process of being tested and integrated into the company s overall system 
the company presently expects that this integration will be substantially completed by june the company utilizes some microcomputers and software in its various manufacturing processes throughout the world 
the company is currently assessing potential yk issues in those processes 
general findings to date indicate that problems usually relate to old personal computers or embedded microprocessors that must be replaced 
although there can be no assurance that the company will identify and correct every yk issue found in the computer applications used in its manufacturing processes  the company believes that it has in place a comprehensive program to identify and correct any such problems  and expects to have substantially completed the remediation of all of its manufacturing systems by june the company is also reviewing its building and utility systems ie  telephones  security  electrical to determine any yk issues as part of its yk program 
many of these systems are yk compliant 
while the company is working with suppliers of these systems and has no reason to expect that they will not meet their yk compliance targets  there is no guarantee that they will do so 
the third component of the yk program  which was initiated in late  involves communication with significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to such parties failure to remediate their own yk issues 
the company s efforts with respect to specific issues identified  including the development of contingency plans  will depend in part upon its assessment of the risk that such issues could have a material adverse impact on the company 
senior management at the company s operating subsidiaries have been charged with identifying third party yk risks which could materially disrupt the subsidiaries business operations 
the company is assisting its subsidiaries in developing contingency plans where such risks have been identified 
contingency plans may include securing alternate sources of supply  increasing inventory levels  stockpiling raw and packaging materials and other appropriate measures 
once developed  contingency plans will be continually refined as additional information is updated 
the company has requested that such contingency plans be completed no later than june  the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the progress of its subsidiaries on this critical matter 
the most reasonably likely worst case yk scenario for the company is a failure on the part of a significant customer or supplier to remediate their own yk issues which results in a disruption of company operations 
however  because the company s customer base is broad enough to minimize the impact of the failure of any single customer interface  and the contingency plans described above will mitigate supply problems  the company currently does not believe that it has any material exposure to significant business interruption as a result of yk issues 
the estimated total cost of the yk program is between million and million  which includes planned upgrades 
this cost  more than half of which has been incurred and expensed at december   is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
this cost and the timing in which the company plans to complete the yk program  are based on management s best estimates  at the present time 
accordingly  there can be no absolute assurance that the company will timely identify and remediate all significant yk issues  that remedial efforts will not involve significant time and expense  or that such issues will not have an adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
