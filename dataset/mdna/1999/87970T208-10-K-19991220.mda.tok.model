item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies  which provide the capability to bridge wireline telecommunications customer premises equipment cpe with cellular type transceivers for use in wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs bands 
applications of the company s technology include fixed wireless telecommunications as a primary access service where wireline systems are unavailable  unreliable or uneconomical  as well as wireless backup systems for wireline telephone systems and wireless security and alarm monitoring signaling was 
the company s principal product lines are phonecell r  a line of fixed wireless terminals fwts  and telguard r  a line of was products 
currently  the company is devoting a substantial portion of its resources to international market development  extension of its core product line to new wireless standards  expansion  protection and licensing of its intellectual property rights and development of underlying radio technology 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is set forth in exhibit to this filing 
overview major trends driving the market for the company s products include broad consumer acceptance of cellular communications  rapid privatization of telecommunications in developed and developing countries  adoption of digital wireless transmission standards that enhance network capacity and service  service network providers acceptance of fwts as cost effective solutions to customer demand for improved telecommunications and pcs licensing that will drive down the price of wireless communications and expand the number of users 
however  poor economic conditions in asia  which negatively affected the company s prospects during fiscal year  may continue for some time 
wireless local loop wll  which is the core of the company s prospects for the fwt business in developing countries  involves cellular infrastructure employed predominately and sometimes exclusively for the fixed location user 
continued growth of the wll market depends primarily on the pricing of wll airtime service to the customer relative to available wireline prices  the relative local availability of wll and wireline service  operator regulatory constraints on fixed cellular  and availability of money in a given country 
these factors have contributed to an increase in the number of new cellular networks  primarily in africa  brazil  china  dominican republic and mexico 
wireless alternative access waa  which represents the majority of the company s current sales in developed countries  has primarily involved an alternative to existing wireline systems  and where wireline service is unavailable  unreliable or uneconomic  placing fwts on cellular networks built for mobile cellular phones to provide regular telephone service 
management anticipates that additional fwt markets for waa applications will develop as existing cellular networks mature and new networks and services are introduced 
as capacity and price competition increase on new and existing cellular networks and the growth rate in new cellular phone subscribers slows  mobile cellular operators will be forced to look for new revenue sources 
fwts provide an excellent opportunity for cellular network operators  as they are less costly to support than mobile units permanently linked to a specific cell site  generate more average airtime  and operate mainly at off peak times 
the number of fwts presently operating on waa networks exceeds that of wll and is driven by the relative price for airtime  as well as by the large installed base of mobile networks worldwide 
the company has a number of undertakings that embody its strategy to capitalize on the growth it anticipates for fwts 
the company s strategy is to leverage its thirteen years of experience in the market  internationally accepted products and court tested patents into a continuing leadership position in the rapidly developing wll and waa fwt equipment industry 
global telecommunications equipment manufacturers together with national and international service providers are increasingly sharing the company s vision that wireless cellular systems in both developed and developing countries are well suited for use as basic telephone service networks 
the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customer s needs through product innovation  rapid time to market with new products  and superior in market customer support 
telular works closely with long distance carriers  cellular service providers  telecommunications infrastructure suppliers and equipment manufacturers to develop new fixed wireless products for global wll markets 
current product lines deploy the major worldwide cellular air interface standards gsm  tdma  cdma  and amps 
development programs are progressing for next generation digital technologies 
the company s research and development staff is focused on developing a steady stream of competitive products addressing the wll and was market opportunities 
its technology competence encompasses all major cellular air interface standards  which is reflected in the broadest product line offering in the fwt and was industries 
during fiscal year  the company improved its fwt market position on gsm  tdma and cdma 
the company introduced second generation gsm  tdma and cdma fwts during fiscal year the gsm product  the sx gsm fwt  incorporates the company s latest product innovations including platform miniaturization and feature enhancements 
the tdma product  the sx tdma fwt  uses a cellular transceiver made by motorola 
the cdma product  the sx cdma fwt  is made by motorola using the company s invention 
the company entered into a distribution agreement with motorola  whereby the company distributes the sx cdma fwt 
in january  the company expects to launch its third generation tdma product  the sx tdma fwt 
the sx tdma fwt incorporates the company s latest product innovations including platform miniaturization and feature enhancements and will utilize a transceiver made by ericsson radio systems ab 
the company expects to capture significantly more fwt market share in the gsm market  primarily in china and europe  in the cdma market  primarily in central and south america  and in the tdma market  primarily in central and south america with these new products during its fiscal year during fiscal year  the company completed market introduction of its second generation telguard was r products  the telguard databurst tm products 
these products have improved features and dramatically reduced cost and price points for both the was terminal and accompanying airtime 
these new products operate on cellular control channels via the aeris communications  inc network nationwide in the usa and are operated via a new communications center located in our atlanta sales office 
the communications center  designed and built by the company  is the first of its kind and may be used for a number of wireless communication applications  including telemetry

the company is using much of the capital raised from the issuance of preferred stock to fund new product development 
beyond product development needs  expected future uses of cash include working capital requirements  marketing and sales support programs and certain capital expenditures 
based upon its current operating plan  the company believes its existing capital resources  including the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and the proposed loan  will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations through fiscal year cash requirements may vary and are difficult to predict given the nature of the developing markets targeted by the company 
the amount of royalty income from the company s licensees is unpredictable  but could have an impact on the company s actual cash flow 
the company requires its foreign customers to obtain letters of credit or to qualify for export credit insurance underwritten by third party credit insurance companies prior to making international shipments 
also  to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars 
impact of the year issue recently  national attention has focused on the potential problems and associated costs resulting from computer programs that have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these programs treat all years as occurring between and and do not self correct to reflect the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year in  management conducted a formal assessment of its significant information technology systems  including computers used in its production and manufacturing functions 
based upon this assessment  management developed an action plan to modify its internal software and hardware imbedded chips so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the cost of such modifications  including testing and implementation  was not significant and was funded with available cash 
although the company has completed all known changes to its internal computer systems and has obtained certification of year compliance from its key external software providers  there can be no absolute assurance that all of the company s internal systems will operate properly in the year and beyond 
the company is prepared to operate the business without the benefit of internal computer systems should its systems fail to operate after december  the company does not conduct any of its purchase transactions through computer systems that interface directly with suppliers 
however  the company has initiated a formal assessment of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company would be vulnerable if those third parties fail to remedy year issues 
to date  the company has received written responses from most of its suppliers 
the company has evaluated these responses and is now monitoring the progress of suppliers that are not fully ready for the year where the company determines that critical suppliers will not be ready for the year  the company will take appropriate actions 
the company currently has no material systems that interface directly with customers 
further  the company has not entered into any significant supply contracts that extend beyond december  the company s large customers beyond december  will likely be new customers due to the project nature of its business 
however  as a global company that operates in many different countries  some of which may not be addressing the year problem as aggressively as the usa  there can be no assurances that future customers will be year compliant 
moreover  because markets for the company s products are dependent on third parties  such as wireless local loop network providers  management cannot fully assess the impact that the year problem will have on future sales 
the company has reviewed each of its product lines and has determined that its products will operate properly in the year and beyond 
however  for some industries  the company s products are integrated with other companies products and sold as combined product by other companies 
there can be no assurances that such combined products  current and future  will operate properly in the year and beyond 
the cost of the company s efforts to prepare for the year was approximately  of which approximately was incurred during the current fiscal year 
management will continue to monitor this issue  particularly the possible impact of third party year compliance on the company s operations 
management believes that it is year ready and does not anticipate any additional preparation cost 
nevertheless  because it is not possible to anticipate all future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company is adversely affected by year problems 
the loss of revenue from such occurrences has not been estimated 
forward looking information statements contained in this filing  other than historical statements  consist of forward looking information 
the company s actual results may vary considerably from those discussed in this filing as a result of various risks and uncertainties 
for example  there are a number of uncertainties as to the degree and duration of the revenue momentum  which could impact the company s ability to be profitable as lower sales may likely result in lower margins 
in addition  product development expenditures  which are expected to benefit future periods  are likely to have a negative impact on near term earnings 
other risks and uncertainties  which are discussed in exhibit to this filing  include the risk that technological change will render the company s technology obsolete  the risk of litigation  the company s ability to develop new products  the company s dependence on contractors  ericsson and motorola  the company s ability to maintain quality control  the risk of doing business in developing markets  the company s dependence on research and development  the uncertainty of additional funding  the effects of control by existing shareholders  the effect of changes in management  intense industry competition  the uncertainty in the development of wireless service generally  and the risk that the company s common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market system for failure to maintain its stock price over one dollar
