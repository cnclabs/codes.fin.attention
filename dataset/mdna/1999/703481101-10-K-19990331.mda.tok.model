the company must maintain on a quarterly basis an ebitda to interest expense of at least to although there can be no assurances  management does not anticipate a future violation of such covenant

from time to time  the company reviews acquisition opportunities relating to its business 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable 
should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise  the company believes it would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital  cash from operations  and either debt or equity financing

depreciation and amortization expense for the contract drilling segment increased from million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the same twelve month period in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was largely attributable to the increased number of drilling rigs added by acquisitions completed during fiscal years and for the twelve months ended december   operating income from the company s contract drilling operations was approximately million as compared to approximately million in the decreased profitability was largely attributable to the decrease in the company s rig utilization rates  a change in drilling contracts which required the company to bear certain costs in associated with drilling wells that in was paid by the company s customers  and  to a lesser extent  moderate decrease during by the company in its daily drilling rates

average rig utilization increased approximately to for the twelve months ended december  direct drilling costs were million or of drilling revenues for the year ended december   while direct drilling costs were million or of related drilling revenues for the increase in contract drilling revenues and associated drilling costs was primarily attributable to the addition of drilling rigs to the company s operable drilling fleet during fiscal year and the addition of operable drilling rigs during the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense for the contract drilling operations was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million in as a result of the company s recent capital acquisitions  depreciation expense increased from approximately million in to approximately million for the year ended december  these increased levels of depreciation expense are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
for the twelve months ended december   income from the company s contract drilling operations was approximately million as compared to approximately million in this increased profitability was largely attributable to the increased rig utilization rate attained during and  to a lesser extent  moderate increases realized by the company during in its daily drilling rates

to the degree that the company generates income in excess of its remaining deferred tax assets  it will incur income tax expense at its effective statutory rate 
income taxes at december   the company had tax net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
these nol carryforwards expire at various dates from through  subject to certain limitations 
prior to august   the company realized substantial federal income tax savings due to the nol carryforwards 
the utilization of these nol carryforwards prior to that date effectively reduced the current federal income tax rate 
during  the company s nol carryforwards became subject to an annual limitation due to a change of over in the stock ownership of the company as defined in internal revenue service code section g 
the nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset net income in any year will be equal to approximately million 
the nol limitation is determined by the value of the company s equity on august   the day prior to the ownership change  times  the federal long term exempt rate on that date as published by the us treasury department  or million  and approximately million which is determined by the value of tucker drilling company  inc s equity on july   the day prior to consummation of the merger  times  the federal long term exempt rate on that date 
during the year ended december   the company began recording non cash federal deferred income taxes based primarily on the relationship between the amount of the company s unused federal nol carryforwards and the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis in the company s assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as a result of fully recognizing the benefit of its deferred income taxes  the company will incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized 
the company incurred deferred income tax expense of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices the company s revenue  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  both with respect to its contract drilling and its oil and natural gas segments 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments and international cartels 
all of these are beyond the control of the company 
any significant or extended decline in oil and or natural gas prices will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the sharp decline in crude oil prices beginning in the fourth quarter of has materially impacted the company s operations 
should oil prices remain at current levels or continue to decline or natural gas prices decline significantly from current prices  the company s operations would be further adversely affected 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation will not have a significant impact on its financial position

year compliance program during fiscal year  the company began implementation of its program for alleviating potential business interruptions that could be caused by the year the company s program identified two principal areas of concern supporting information technology systems it systems and the company s related vulnerability to external providers of services and materials 
the company currently maintains three separate infrastructures to facilitate the processing of daily transactions and financial reporting 
each of the lines of business engaged in by the company function separately from the other and therefore operates on individual computer platforms 
the company has completed its conversion of each of the computer platforms resulting in the replacement and modification of certain hardware and software applications that previously were determined not to be compliant with year issues 
the ability of the company to conduct its business efficiently and productively requires that providers of services and materials to the company  as well as  major customers to the company collectively referred to herein as external agents be year compliant 
the company has implemented a process whereby external agents are identified and prioritized by level of exposure 
management of the company is in the process of assessing the readiness and effectiveness of its external agents for the year surveys  solicitations and other forms of inquiry are being used to make this determination 
management intends to interpret the responses and information gathered and determine on an individual basis whether the company is vulnerable to that external agent 
this process will continue through january as a means to provide a continuous update as to the external agents status and success 
the company does not expect the total cost associated with the company s efforts to become year compliant to be material to the company s financial position 
the total amount expended on the project through december  was approximately million 
the company expects to significantly reduce its level of uncertainty about year issues and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its external agents 
accordingly  the company does not deem it necessary to formally adopt a contingency plan 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of its program as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the foregoing disclosure constitutes year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to market risk associated with the floating rate portion of the interest charged on its million term loan with norwest bank texas  na the term loan  which matures on january   bears interest at libor plus 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in libor is not expected to be material and at december   the fair value of the obligation approximates its related carrying value because the obligation bears interest at the current market rate
