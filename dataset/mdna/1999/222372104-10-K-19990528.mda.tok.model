item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business strategy is primarily focused on four areas loan production  loan servicing  capital markets and businesses ancillary to mortgage lending 
loan production and loan servicing comprise the company s mortgage banking business 
see business mortgage banking operations  business capital markets and business other operations 
the company intends to continue its efforts to expand its operations in each segment focus area 
a strong production capability and a growing servicing portfolio are the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates because the effect of interest rate changes on loan production income is counter cyclical to their effect on servicing income 
the operations of the capital markets segment include trading mortgage backed securities mbs and other mortgage related assets as well as brokering service contracts and bulk purchases and sales of whole loans 
finally  the company is involved in business activities complementary to its mortgage banking business 
these services include acting as agent in the sale of insurance  including homeowners  fire  flood  earthquake  life and disability  providing various title insurance agent and escrow services and offering appraisal and credit reporting services 
the company s results of operations historically have been influenced primarily by the level of demand for mortgage loans  which is affected by such external factors as the level and direction of interest rates  and the strength of the overall economy and the economy in each of the company s lending markets 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a period in which interest rates were somewhat volatile 
the rates during fiscal were generally higher than during the previous fiscal year  however  they remained at levels that were conducive to refinance and home purchase activity 
the company s earnings increased from the fiscal year ended february  fiscal 
loan production increased to billion  up from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i the generally strong economy and home purchase market  ii the continued implementation of a national advertising campaign  which was aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly  and iii the integration of home equity and sub prime lending into the company s product offerings and production capacity 
for calendar  the company ranked second in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
the company s market share for both calendar and was approximately of the estimated billion and billion  respectively  single family mortgage origination market 
during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion  up from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions that amounted to billion 
the increase was partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  slightly down from the prior year due to the higher mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a record year from ongoing operations in revenues and net earnings for the company 
loan production increased to billion  up from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i lower interest rates  ii the generally strong economy and home purchase market  iii the continued implementation of a national advertising campaign aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly  and iv increased expansion of the consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the new retail sub prime branches

in substance  inmc acquired the assets  operations and employees of its former manager countrywide asset management corporation camc  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
inmc no longer pays management fees to camc 
in return  the company received  newly issued common shares of inmc 
these shares are subject to resale restrictions which apply to the shares from the date of issuance through up to three years 
the transaction was structured as a merger of camc with and into inmc 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a record year from ongoing operations in revenues and net earnings for the company 
loan production increased to billion  up from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i an increase in the overall mortgage market driven largely by refinances  ii the generally strong economy and home purchase market  and iii an increase in the company s market share  driven largely by the expansion of its consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the new retail sub prime branches

the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  up from the prior year due to the lower mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues from ongoing operations for fiscal increased to  million  up from  million for fiscal net earnings from ongoing operations increased to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal revenues and net earnings from ongoing operations for fiscal exclude a nonrecurring pre tax gain of million on the sale of camc 
the increase in revenues and net earnings from ongoing operations for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to higher loan production volume  an increase in the size of the company s servicing portfolio and an increase in the income of the non mortgage banking subsidiaries 
these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in amortization of the servicing asset and an increase in expenses in fiscal over fiscal the total volume of loans produced by the company increased to billion for fiscal  up from billion for fiscal the increase in loan production was primarily due to an increase in the company s market share  driven largely by the expansion of the company s consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the retail sub prime branches  combined with an increase in the overall mortgage market driven largely by refinances 
refinancings totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal fixed rate mortgage loan production totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal total loan volume in the company s production divisions is summarized below 
dollar amounts in millions loan production fiscal fiscal consumer markets division   wholesale lending division   correspondent lending division   full spectrum lending  inc total loan volume   electronic commerce  this category includes loans sourced through the company s website of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as well as loans submitted to the correspondent lending division via its correspondent website of  million for fiscal the factors which affect the relative volume of production among the company s divisions include the price competitiveness of each division s product offerings  the level of mortgage lending activity in each division s market and the success of each division s sales and marketing efforts 
included in the company s total volume of loans produced are billion of home equity loans funded in fiscal and billion funded in fiscal sub prime loan production  which is also included in the company s total production volume  was billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal as of february  and  the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion and billion  respectively

in addition  as of february   the company had committed to make loans in the amount of billion  subject to property identification and approval of the loans the lock n shop r pipeline 
as of february   the lock n shop r pipeline was billion 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company received  and  new loan applications  respectively  at an average daily rate of million and million  respectively 
the factors that affect the percentage of applications received and funded during a given time period include the movement and direction of interest rates  the average length of loan commitments issued  the creditworthiness of applicants  the production divisions loan processing efficiency and loan pricing decisions 
loan origination fees increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher production 
in addition  the consumer markets and wholesale lending divisions which  due to their higher cost structure  charge higher origination fees per dollar loaned comprised a greater percentage of total production in fiscal than in fiscal gain on sale of loans also increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher production volume 
this positive factor was partially offset by reduced margins on home equity and sub prime loans 
the sale of home equity loans contributed million and million to gain on sale of loans in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sub prime loans contributed million to the gain on sale of loans in fiscal and million in fiscal in general  loan origination fees and gain loss on sale of loans are affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans produced and sold  loan pricing decisions  interest rate volatility and the general direction of interest rates 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges increased to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal net interest income is principally a function of i net interest income earned from the company s mortgage loan warehouse million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  ii interest expense related to the company s investment in servicing rights million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively and iii interest income earned from the custodial balances associated with the company s servicing portfolio million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company earns interest on  and incurs interest expense to carry  mortgage loans held in its warehouse 
the increase in net interest income from the mortgage loan warehouse was primarily attributable to higher production levels 
the increase in interest expense on the investment in servicing rights resulted primarily from a larger servicing portfolio and an increase in the payments of interest to certain investors pursuant to customary servicing arrangements with regard to paid off loans in excess of the interest earned on these loans through their respective payoff dates interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the increase in net interest income earned from the custodial balances was related to an increase in the average custodial balances caused by growth of the servicing portfolio and an increase in the amount of prepayments 
during fiscal  loan servicing income before amortization increased primarily due to growth of the loan servicing portfolio 
as of february   the company serviced billion of loans including billion of loans subserviced for others  compared to billion including billion of loans subserviced for others as of february   which was an increase 
the growth in the company s servicing portfolio during fiscal was the result of increased loan production volume and the acquisition of bulk servicing rights 
this was partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments  scheduled amortization of mortgage loans and the transfer back to inmc of billion of subservicing 
during fiscal  the annual prepayment rate of the company s servicing portfolio was  compared to for fiscal in general  the prepayment rate is affected by the level of refinance activity  which in turn is driven by the relative level of mortgage interest rates  and activity in the home purchase market 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans in the company s servicing portfolio as of february  was compared to as of february  the company recorded amortization and net impairment of its msrs for fiscal totaling  million consisting of amortization amounting to million and impairment of million  compared to million of amortization and impairment consisting of amortization amounting to million and impairment of million for fiscal to mitigate the effect on earnings of msr impairment that may result from increased current and projected future prepayment activity  the company acquires financial instruments  including derivative contracts  that increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
the factors affecting the amount of amortization and impairment of the msrs recorded in an accounting period include the level of prepayments during the period  the change in estimated future prepayments and the amount of servicing hedge gains or losses 
in fiscal  the company recognized a net benefit of million from its servicing hedge 
the net benefit included unrealized net gains of million and realized net gains of million from the sale of various financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge net of premium amortization 
in fiscal  the company recognized a net benefit of million from its servicing hedge 
the net benefit included unrealized gains of million and net realized gains of million from the sale of various financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge net of premium amortization 
there can be no assurance that the servicing hedge will generate gains in the future  or if gains are generated that they will fully offset impairment of the msrs 
the financial instruments that comprised the servicing hedge include options on interest rate futures and mbs  interest rate futures  interest rate floors  interest rate swaps  interest rate swaps with the company s maximum payment capped capped swaps  options on interest rate swaps swaptions  interest rate caps  certain tranches of collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and options on callable pass through certificates options on cpc 
with the capped swaps  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the rate received is fixed 
the rate paid is adjustable  is indexed to the london interbank offered rates for us dollar deposits libor and has a specified maximum or cap 
with swaps  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the rate received is fixed  the rate paid is adjustable and is indexed to libor 
with the swaptions  the company has the option to enter into a receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap at a future date or to settle the transaction for cash 
the cmos  which consist of principal only p o securities  have been purchased at deep discounts to their par values 
as interest rates decrease  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos should increase 
this results in a decline in the average lives of the p o securities and a corresponding increase in the present values of their cash flows 
conversely  as interest rates increase  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos should decrease 
this would result in an increase in the average lives of the p o securities and a decrease in the present values of their cash flows 
an option on cpc gives the holder the right to call a mortgage backed security at par and receive the remaining cash flows from the particular pool 
this option has a one year lockout  meaning it cannot be exercised until the end of the first year 
after the lockout period  the option can be exercised at anytime 
the servicing hedge is designed to protect the value of the investment in mortgage servicing rights msrs from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates increase  the value of the msrs increases while the value of the hedge instruments declines 
with respect to the floors  options  caps  swaptions  options on cpc and cmos  the company is not exposed to loss beyond its initial outlay to acquire the hedge instruments plus any unrealized gains recognized to date 
the company s exposure to loss on futures is related to changes in the libor rate over the life of the contract 
the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual terms is million 
with respect to the capped swaps contracts entered into by the company as of february   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual terms is million

profitability of servicing segment in fiscal  pre tax earnings from the loan servicing segment which includes administering the loans in the servicing portfolio  selling homeowners and other insurance  acting as tax payment agent  marketing foreclosed properties and acting as reinsurer were million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily attributed to increased amortization of msrs and interest costs incurred on payoffs due to increased prepayments from fiscal to fiscal these negative factors were partially offset by the increase in servicing fees  miscellaneous income and interest earned on escrow balances derived by the larger servicing portfolio 
profitability of capital markets segment in fiscal  pre tax earnings from the capital markets segment were million 
in fiscal  comparable pre tax earnings were million 
the increase of million was primarily the result of increased trading volumes 
profitability of other activities in addition to loan production  loan servicing and capital markets  the company offers ancillary products and services related to its mortgage banking activities  primarily through its subsidiary  landsafe inc through several subsidiaries  landsafe  inc acts as a title insurance agent and a provider of settlement  escrow  appraisal and credit reporting services 
during fiscal  landsafe  inc  through a subsidiary  began providing home inspection services 
in addition  landsafe inc provides property profiles to realtors  builders  consumers  mortgage brokers and other financial institutions 
for fiscal  landsafe inc contributed million to the company s pre tax income compared to million for fiscal the increase in landsafe inc pre tax income primarily resulted from expanded services and increased loan production 
additionally  the company s other activities include the operations of cci and countrywide financial services  inc the operations of other activities  excluding landsafe inc  contributed million to the company s pre tax income for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in pre tax income primarily resulted from an increase in cci dividend income 
during fiscal  countrywide asset management corporation  a subsidiary of the company  was sold to inmc a publicly traded real estate investment trust for  newly issued common shares of inmc stock 
these shares are subject to resale restrictions which apply to the shares from the date of issuance through up to three years 
the sale resulted in a million pre tax gain 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise perspective  the company manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination and loan servicing business segments  which are counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  the company utilizes various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs  mortgage backed securities retained in securitizations  trading securities and debt securities 
the overall objective of the company s interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company does not speculate on the direction of interest rates in its management of interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the company performs various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate scenarios including selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments 
for mortgages  mbs and mbs forward contracts and cmos  an option adjusted spread oas model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
msrs and residual interests are valued using discounted cash flow models 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
utilizing the sensitivity analyses described above  as of february   the company estimates that a permanent reduction in interest rates  all else being constant  would result in a million after tax gain related to its trading securities and a million after tax loss related to its other financial instruments 
as of february   the company estimates that this combined after tax loss of million is the largest such loss that would occur within the range of reasonably possible interest rate changes 
these sensitivity analyses are limited by the fact that they are performed at a particular point in time and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s financial performance in such a scenario 
consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as a forecast 
an additional market risk facing the company is foreign currency risk 
during fiscal  the company issued foreign currency denominated medium term notes see note f 
the company manages the foreign currency risk associated with such medium term notes by entering into currency swaps 
the terms of the currency swaps effectively translate the foreign currency denominated medium term notes into the company s reporting currency ie  ie dollars thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk 
as a result  hypothetical changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the areas of loan production and servicing 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancings 
although in an environment of gradual interest rate increases  purchase activity may actually be stimulated by an improving economy or the anticipation of increasing real estate values 
in such periods of reduced loan production  production margins may decline due to increased competition resulting from overcapacity in the market 
in a higher interest rate environment  servicing related earnings are enhanced because prepayment rates tend to slow down thereby extending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and reducing amortization and impairment of the msrs  decreasing interest costs incurred on payoffs and because the rate of interest earned from the custodial balances tends to increase 
conversely  as interest rates decline  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  increases 
however  during such periods  prepayment rates tend to accelerate principally on the portion of the portfolio having a note rate higher than the then current interest rates  thereby decreasing the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and adversely impacting its servicing related earnings primarily due to increased amortization and impairment of the msrs  a decreased rate of interest earned from the custodial balances and increased interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the impacts of changing interest rates on servicing related earnings are reduced by performance of the servicing hedge  which is designed to mitigate the impact on earnings of higher amortization and impairment that may result from declining interest rates 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes  although refinancings tend to be less seasonal and more closely related to changes in interest rates 
sales and resales of homes typically peak during the spring and summer seasons and decline to lower levels from mid november through february 
in addition  delinquency rates typically rise in the winter months  which results in higher servicing costs 
however  late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset such incremental expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal financing needs are the financing of its mortgage loan inventory and its investment in msrs 
to meet these needs  the company currently utilizes commercial paper supported by the revolving credit facility  medium term notes  mbs repurchase agreements  subordinated notes  pre sale funding facilities  an optional cash purchase feature in the dividend reinvestment plan  redeemable capital trust pass through securities and cash flow from operations 
in addition  in the past the company has utilized whole loan repurchase agreements  servicing secured bank facilities  private placements of unsecured notes and other financings  direct borrowings from the revolving credit facility and public offerings of common and preferred stock 
certain of the debt obligations of the company and countrywide home loans  inc chl contain various provisions that may affect the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends and remain in compliance with such obligations 
these provisions include requirements concerning net worth and other financial covenants 
these provisions have not had  and are not expected to have  an adverse impact on the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends 
the company continues to investigate and pursue alternative and supplementary methods to finance its growing operations through the public and private capital markets 
these may include such methods as mortgage loan sale transactions designed to expand the company s financial capacity and reduce its cost of capital and the securitization of servicing income cash flows 
in connection with its derivative contracts  the company may be required to deposit cash or certain government securities or obtain letters of credit to meet margin requirements 
the company considers such potential margin requirements in its overall liquidity management 
in the course of the company s mortgage banking operations  the company sells the mortgage loans it originates and purchases to investors but generally retains the right to service the loans  thereby increasing the company s investment in msrs 
the company views the sale of loans on a servicing retained basis in part as an investment vehicle 
significant unanticipated prepayments in the company s servicing portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and liquidity 
cash flows operating activities in fiscal  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion on a short term basis primarily to support the increase in its mortgage loans and mbs held for sale 
in fiscal  operating activities used approximately billion on a short term basis primarily to support the increase in its mortgage loans and mbs held for sale 
in fiscal  the company s operating activities provided cash of approximately billion 
investing activities the primary investing activity for which cash was used by the company was the investment in msrs 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash used by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal the increase or decrease in cash flow from financing activities was primarily the result of the change in the company s mortgage loan inventory and investment in msrs 
prospective trends applications and pipeline of loans in process during fiscal  the company received new loan applications at an average daily rate of million 
as of february   the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion 
this compares to a daily application rate in fiscal of million and a pipeline of loans in process as of february  of billion 
the size of the pipeline is generally an indication of the level of future fundings  as historically to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in addition  the company s lock n shop r pipeline as of february  was billion and as of february  was billion 
for the month ended march   the average daily rate of applications received was million  and as of march   the pipeline of loans in process was billion and the lock n shop pipeline was billion 
future application levels and loan fundings are dependent on numerous factors  including the level of demand for mortgage loans  the level of competition in the market  the direction of interest rates  seasonal factors and general economic conditions 
market factors loan production increased from fiscal to fiscal this increase was primarily due to three factors 
first  the company s market share increased  driven largely by the expansion of the company s consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the new retail sub prime branches 
second  mortgage interest rates generally decreased during fiscal  driving an increase in refinances 
third  new and existing home sales were stronger during fiscal than in fiscal the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio increased from fiscal to fiscal this was due primarily to increased refinances 
the company s primary competitors are commercial banks  savings and loans  mortgage banking subsidiaries of diversified companies  as well as other mortgage bankers 
over the past several years  certain commercial banks have expanded their mortgage banking operations through the acquisition of formerly independent mortgage banking companies or through consolidation 
the company believes that these transactions and activities have not had a material impact on the overall level of competition in the market 
the company s california mortgage loan production as measured by principal balance constituted of its total production during fiscal and during fiscal the company is continuing its efforts to expand its production capacity outside of california 
some regions in which the company operates have experienced slower economic growth  and real estate financing activity in these regions has been impacted negatively 
the company has striven to diversify its mortgage banking activities geographically to mitigate such effects 
the delinquency rate in the company s servicing portfolio  excluding sub servicing  decreased to as of february  from as of february  the company believes that this decrease was primarily the result of changes in portfolio mix and aging 
the proportion of government loans and high loan to value conventional loans which tend to experience higher delinquency rates than low loan to value conventional loans was and of the portfolio as of february  and february   respectively 
in addition  the weighted average age of the portfolio was months at february   down from months as of february  delinquency rates tend to increase as loans age  reaching a peak at three to five years of age 
however  because the loans in the portfolio are generally serviced on a non recourse basis  the company s exposure to credit loss resulting from increased delinquency rates is substantially limited 
furthermore the  related late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset incremental servicing expenses resulting from an increased delinquency rate 
the percentage of loans in the company s servicing portfolio  excluding sub servicing  that are in foreclosure decreased to as of february  from as of february  generally  the company is not exposed to credit risk 
because the company services substantially all conventional loans on a non recourse basis  foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the investor or insurer and not the company 
while the company does not generally retain credit risk with respect to the prime credit quality first mortgage loans it sells  it does have potential liability under representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties  the company may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by the company 
similarly  government loans serviced by the company of the company s servicing portfolio as of february  are insured by the federal housing administration or partially guaranteed against loss by the department of veterans administration 
the company is exposed to credit losses to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the department of veterans administration is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
the company retains credit risk on the home equity and sub prime loans it securitizes  through retention of a subordinated interest 
as of february   the company had investments in such subordinated interests amounting to million 
servicing hedge as previously discussed  the company s servicing hedge is designed to protect the value of its investment in msrs from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  the value of the servicing hedge generally declines and the value of msrs generally increases 
there can be no assurance that  in periods of increasing interest rates  the increase in value of the msrs will offset the decline in value of the servicing hedge 
likewise  there can be no assurance that  in periods of declining interest rates  that the servicing hedge will generate gains  or if gains are generated  that they will fully offset impairment of the msrs 
implementation of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize the fair value of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
this statement will become effective in the fiscal year ended february  the company has not yet determined the impact upon adoption of this standard on the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise sfas no 

sfas no 
is an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
it requires that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities and other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those instruments 
the company adopted this statement in october and reclassified mortgage backed securities retained in securitization as available for sale securities 
year update the company has four distinct year projects  each of which focuses on a particular critical area 
the company s primary platform is the ibm as which contains all of the data relating to the origination and servicing of the home loans in the company s portfolio 
as of december  the company has substantially reprogrammed and re engineered the system to incorporate four digit century date fields by testing the function and accuracy of the reprogrammed fields  implementing the revised code and forward date testing of the more than  production programs on the as many of the company s client server applications have been developed in house and in a year compliant format 
the majority of these applications interface with the as the company has reviewed each of its mission critical client server applications to confirm their year readiness 
additionally  as part of this project  the company has tested the interfaces between the individual mission critical client server applications and the as to confirm that accurate data is exchanged with the revised as programs 
all but one of the company s mission critical client server applications have been forward date tested 
the company estimates that forward date testing of the one remaining mission critical client server application and most of its less critical applications will be completed by june  newly developed client server applications are forward date tested before they are implemented into production 
the company s infrastructure project has inventoried the personal computers used by the company s employees nationwide to determine the year readiness of these computers 
the company has fewer than computers and related hardware which are not year compliant  and they will be upgraded or replaced before december  as part of the infrastructure project  the company also identified shrink wrapped and desktop software used company wide  as well as desktop software supporting individuals and individual business units  in order to determine whether the vendor is bringing its products into compliance 
this project also monitors websites and other available information concerning software and hardware vendors and disseminates the latest available information to those business units relying on the product 
in the event that the products are not  or will not be compliant  the company is assessing its need for these applications 
with respect to non compliant software  the company will either seek alternative sources of similar applications  develop its own applications or attempt to obtain the source code and the vendor s authorization to re engineer it 
the infrastructure project has inventoried  assessed  corrected and forward date tested the company s mission critical wide area network components  telecommunications systems and unique business systems 
additionally  the infrastructure project personnel  along with personnel from the company s facilities and property management departments  have evaluated building systems of the company s corporate facilities to assess whether they will operate satisfactorily in the year and beyond 
these building systems include energy management  environmental  and safety and security systems 
where necessary  non compliant systems or components will be upgraded or replaced before december  the communications project personnel have developed a database for collecting information regarding the year status of the company s strategic business partners and other vendors and suppliers 
individual business units identify contact information in the database regarding their respective business partners  vendors and suppliers 
the database tracks the inquiry made of each such entity  that entity s response to the company s inquiry and the company s response to each entity s inquiry 
analysis of the information contained in the database and development of additional features and functions of the database are ongoing 
the goal is to achieve a reasonable understanding of the year readiness and contingency plans of the company s business partners  vendors and suppliers well in advance of the year the company has successfully completed company wide testing of electronic interfaces with freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae 
additionally  the communications project personnel represent the company in its participation as one of the leading mortgage banking companies involved in the mortgage bankers association mba inter industry testing project 
other participants include freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae  as well as banks  insurance companies and credit bureaus 
the mba project involves inter industry testing of transactions from loan origination  secondary marketing and loan servicing areas and its mission is to make sure the various interfaces work together across the entire industry 
contingency planning the company has retained a vendor specializing in business continuity planning to review its business continuity procedures on a company wide basis and assist in its assessment of the contingency plans of each business unit  as well as those of mission critical business partners  vendors and suppliers 
documentation of the year aspect of business recovery planning for the company s mission critical business functions is complete 
the business analysis aspect of the contingency planning process also serves as a means of verifying the company s existing inventories of client server applications  infrastructure hardware and software  vendors and suppliers  external and internal interfaces and business partners 
costs the total cost associated with the company s year efforts is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the company is expensing these costs during the period in which they are incurred 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately million  of which million had been incurred through february  however  the company s expectations about future costs associated with the year are subject to uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
factors that could influence the amount and timing of future costs include the success of the company in identifying systems and programs that are not year compliant  the nature and amount of programming required to replace or upgrade each of the affected programs  the availability  rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the company s business partners  vendors and clients in addressing year issues 
risks due to the global nature of the year issue  the company cannot determine all of the consequences the year may have on its business and operations 
the company believes that in light of the efforts of its year projects  including the contingency planning aspect  the possibility of material business interruptions is unlikely 
however  there may be instances where the company will rely on third party information  which may be unreliable or unverifiable 
furthermore  the company cannot be assured that the third parties  upon which it relies  including utilities and telecommunications service providers  will not have business interruptions which could have an adverse effect on the company
