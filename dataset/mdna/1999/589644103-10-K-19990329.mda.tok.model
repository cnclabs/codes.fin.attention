item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview results of operations improved significantly during despite a record level of weather related catastrophe losses 
this improvement results in large part from actions taken in and to improve underwriting profitability 
such efforts included underwriting programs related to proper risk selection  certain premium rate changes  and various agency management actions 
these actions were necessary  even though in the short term they negatively affected growth in premium revenue 
given the improved underwriting profitability of the company s core business  the focus is now on a number of growth initiatives including state expansion  the continued roll out of the non standard auto product and affinity group marketing 
during recent years  the company has aggressively expanded its operations into new states 
at the end of  meridian operated in seven states  entirely in the midwest 
the company has significantly increased its geographic diversification and presently operates in states 
additional state expansion  including arizona  georgia  kansas and maryland  is planned for during  meridian introduced its new non standard automobile coverage 
non standard automobile insurance covers drivers with no prior insurance or with driving records that do not qualify them for standard premium rates 
non standard policies are generally sold at higher premiums to offset increased risk of loss 
the non standard auto policies are currently marketed through the company s independent agency force  key non standard specialty agents and direct sales 
marketing products through independent agents has always been the company s primary source of distribution 
the company continues to build these relationships  increasing the independent agency count from  to  during the company s growth strategy requires adding additional distribution methods 
meridian recently established an affinity marketing relationship with a bank in virginia and is actively seeking affiliations with additional banks and other affinity partners  through which it will use direct response techniques 
participation in a marketing and sales partnership with groupadvantage offers promising opportunities 
this sales arrangement makes meridian s personal lines products available through franchised independent agencies to sam s club members in certain states 
specifically  in october we began marketing our products to sam club members in michigan 
shortly thereafter  illinois was added and we expect to make our products available to sam s club members in several additional states during groupadvantage is a registered service mark of consumer insurance services of america cisa and is used under license from cisa 
in addition to growth initiatives  the company is working to increase profitability through consistent exercise of underwriting discipline  sound investment management  enhanced customer service and cost control 
enhanced use of automated tools  such as the personal lines automated underwriting system  is expected to add efficiency 
operational consolidation is also expected to result in cost savings 
during the fourth quarter  the company consolidated its two regional claim centers into its indianapolis claims operation 
additionally  the information systems of the meridian citizens companies formerly citizens security group companies were centralized into the company s indianapolis location 
it is expected that the consolidation of the regional claims offices and the meridian citizens information systems into the company s headquarters will lower operating expenses  while maintaining a high level of service to agents and policyholders 
the company estimates annualized cost savings of at least  or per share after tax  to result from these consolidation efforts 
year disclosures as we near the end of the century  many information technology products will not recognize the year as a result  businesses are at risk for possible calculation errors or system failures which could cause a disruption in their operations 
this is known as the year yk issue 
in  meridian began the initial planning phase to ensure that all systems were yk compliant 
as a result of this planning  it was determined that meridian would utilize internal resources to complete the necessary remediation 
this would allow meridian to contain costs and maintain control as well as provide consistency in system applications 
as a result of this decision  a team of programmers was hired under the direction of experienced internal management to address the issue 
it was also determined that the meridian citizens project team would operate independently utilizing contracted personnel to complete the project 
such personnel  our contracted outside automation services providers  were under contract to complete and test the yk programming efforts 
this process was supervised by internal meridian staff to maintain consistency 
the next stage of the process was to identify those systems and programs that contained date sensitive fields throughout the operating systems 
the meridian approach taken to address the issue was field expansion 
this expansion would allow the date fields to be expanded and allow programs to distinguish dates based upon an eight digit code as opposed to a six digit code 
the meridian citizens approach implemented by the outside automation services provider  had to take into account the various operating platforms used to process data 
it was decided that a combination of methods would be the best approach to solving the yk dilemma 
a combination of field expansion and windowing was utilized to address the issue 
the windowing approach utilizes a two digit year currently in the date fields 
for example  any result over signifies the th century and any under fifty  the st century 
three years into the project  meridian has made significant progress 
prioritizing the effort was done by reviewing those systems and programs which would require the effective date change prior to january  such as policy processing systems which required renewal processing as early as november of extensive reprogramming now allows these internal policy processing systems to recognize the difference between the th and the st century 
meridians remediated policy processing systems have been in production and compliant since november in july  meridian also completed code remediation for the management reporting systems and front end client server systems 
the meridian citizens companies which again operate on a different platform  achieved yk compliance in august and have been in production since that time 
mainframe impact  front end client server  and critical network programming have also been completed 
critical operating systems for the company have been tested by our quality of assurance unit and were found to be compliant 
there are a few internal non critical programming efforts which are still in the process of remediation 
the majority of these are expected to be completed and tested by the end of a few are targeted for completion during the first and second quarters of it is anticipated that these systems will be remediated  tested  and moved into production by july as the company has already processed policies encompassing yk dates  the company does not feel at risk for yk difficulties and as such no contingency plans are currently in place for the operating systems 
meridian anticipates that the costs associated with yk remediation will approximate million upon completion 
such incremental costs have been estimated at approximately  in and approximately  per year for it is also anticipated that approximately  will be spent in approximately percent of the total costs relate to personnel such as custom programmers 
the remainder relates to costs for replacing certain software applications and equipment 
such costs have been funded through operating revenues and represent less than percent of the information systems annual budgets 
costs associated with the meridian citizens remediation were included under the automation programming charges incurred by the company on a monthly basis and were therefore not distinguishable from normal programming fees 
due to the complexity and impact of the yk project  the company engaged independent consultants to review the planning and remediation methods utilized within the project for all subsidiaries 
the written report received from the independent consultants contained comments and suggestions which were implemented and incorporated into the final yk action plans 
at this time the company s policy processing and management reporting systems have been corrected  thoroughly tested by our quality assurance team and moved into full production 
actual policies have been processed which are affected by the yk issue 
throughout  the company will double check the systems to verify that the infrastructure will respond correctly to the actual century date change 
the company has also addressed the facilities yk issues by evaluating hvac  security systems  elevators  the automobile fleet  etc  to ascertain compliance 
as part of the readiness program  the company also recognized the impact that significant outside vendors  agents  and other business associates could have on the ability to transact business 
as a result  the company has reviewed vendor associated software and hardware products utilized within the organization to determine the yk effort that would be necessary to achieve readiness 
the company also identified specific hardware and software that needed to be replaced as a result of the yk issue 
it is anticipated that the replacement process will be completed in early most are currently in compliance  scheduled for upgrade  or in the process of being eliminated 
in addition  the company also established contact with agents and certain vendors to highlight this issue 
this contact was established with the purpose of reasonably ascertaining the yk impact 
where possible  the company has reviewed plans received by outside providers for their yk compliance effort 
in some cases  these entities have a lower level of readiness and preparation and as a result are not able to provide this type of information 
should an agent be non compliant for yk  the company s contingency plan is the current ability to process or underwrite policies on a manual basis 
while this may have a direct impact on the timeliness of policy processing  the operating systems do have the ability to process such data 
third party vendors which have critical impact on the ability to process are currently anticipated to be yk compliant 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of agents or other third parties will be converted on a timely basis  or that a widespread failure to convert by others would not adversely affect the company 
it is not anticipated that non critical third party vendors who fail to be yk compliant will impact the ability to complete necessary work processes 
no contingency plan is in place for these non critical business vendors at this time 
the company does not issue insurance policies covering risks related to the year issue 
however  there can be no certainty regarding future judicial or legislative interpretations of coverage 
while the company has utilized significant resources to secure its critical operating systems  there are no contingency plans for things which effect the general public such as electrical power  water  and etc 
failure for these providers to perform yk compliance could be detrimental to company operations 
no significant information technology projects having a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations have been deferred as a direct result of year efforts 
statements in this k document that are not strictly historical may be forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
risk factors include the ability of the company  suppliers  and agency representatives to handle the yk computer issue  variation in catastrophe losses due to changes in weather patterns or other natural causes  changes in insurance regulations or legislation that may affect the company  and economic conditions or market changes affecting pricing or demand for insurance products or the ability to generate investment income 
growth and profitability have been and may be affected by these and other factors 
results of operations compared to net income for grew percent to million  or diluted earnings per share  up from million  or per diluted share for this improvement was achieved in spite of more than double the amount of weather related catastrophe losses in  compared with net catastrophe losses were approximately million in versus approximately million for the company s combined ratio improved to percent for from percent in realized investment gains for increased to million  or per share after tax  from million  or per share after tax  for the company s total revenues for decreased percent to million from million in premiums earned decreased percent to million for in comparison to million for the previous year 
net written premiums for the company s personal lines of business decreased by approximately percent 
this was the combination of a percent increase in personal automobile premiums and a decrease in written premium for the homeowners line of business 
the personal automobile growth was favorably affected by the introduction of the new non standard automobile product 
net written premiums for the farmowners line of business increased approximately percent 
commercial lines net written premium decreased approximately percent 
underwriting actions were taken in and early to improve profitability  negatively affecting premium revenue growth in the short term 
additionally  intense competition and a soft pricing environment continued to affect market conditions in the company s operating territory  particularly for commercial lines of business 
net investment income of approximately million for increased percent in comparison to million for this increase was due in part to a larger invested asset base for much of the year 
the company s pre tax net investment yield was enhanced by a reduction in the tax advantaged portfolio allocation and a reduced allocation to investment expense 
for the years ended december  and  the company realized net investment gains of approximately and million  respectively 
the current year s realized gains resulted largely from the sale of certain equity securities  as well as from certain municipal bond sales motivated by tax planning strategies 
loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased from the million reported at year end to million in the improvement was achieved despite the high level of weather related catastrophe losses which hit the midwest 
many of the company s operating states reported significant weather related damage 
most significantly  industry statistics indicated minnesota  the largest state of operation for the meridian citizens companies  incurred more such losses in than in the last years combined 
this caused the meridian citizens companies to incur approximately half of the company s consolidated catastrophe losses  while generating less than percent of the company s premium volume 
the company estimated weather related losses to approximate million in compared to million in despite the record level of catastrophe weather related claims  the statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved for nearly all lines of business when compared to the personal lines loss ratio of percent improved percentage points from personal automobile  the company s largest line of business  had a loss ratio of percent  compared to percent for the commercial lines loss ratio of percent is also an improvement over the result of percent 
worker s compensation continues to be very profitable for the company reporting a percent loss ratio in versus percent for much of the improvement in the company s core book of business is attributed to underwriting actions implemented in late and early the company generally experienced favorable trends during in both the frequency and severity of claims incurred 
general operating and amortization expenses of million in slightly increased from the million recorded during relative to earned premium volume  the company s expense ratio increased to percent compared to percent for the reduction in premium volume over which to spread fixed costs was a factor behind this increase  as were costs to initiate new growth strategies 
during the fourth quarter of  the company consolidated two regional claims centers and the meridian citizens information systems into the company s indianapolis location 
while expected to produce cost savings beginning in  incremental costs to implement these changes were estimated at approximately per share after tax in for the year ended december   the company recorded income tax expense of million compared to million for the same period 
the higher level of pre tax income and a reduction in the tax advantaged portfolio allocation to municipal bonds and sinking fund preferred stocks were the primary factors in the increase 
compared to for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of million  or 
basic earnings per common share 
diluted earnings per share 
this compares to net income of million  or basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share 
included in the results was an entire year of operations from the acquisition of the citizens security companies  compared to five months of citizens security operations for the prior period 
earnings for both periods were negatively impacted by a large volume of property damage claims associated with severe weather that occurred throughout the company s operating territory 
weather related catastrophe losses were estimated to be approximately million  or per share  in and million  or 
per share  in the company s statutory combined ratio was percent versus percent for the company s total revenues for increased percent to million from million for premiums earned increased percent to million for in comparison to million for the previous year 
the acquisition of the citizens security group accounted for approximately million of the increase 
aside from the acquisition  net premiums earned from the meridian book of business increased approximately percent  excluding its participation in the national workers compensation pool nwcp 
personal and farm lines of business were the primary contributors to the increase with percent growth  offset partially by a percent decline in commercial lines 
commercial lines of business continue to be affected by highly competitive market conditions in the company s operating territory 
the earned premium volume in the company s workers compensation line was reduced by an approximately million decline in assumed earned premiums from its involuntary participation in the nwcp 
this was principally due to reduced participation in the assigned risk pools for the states of kentucky and tennessee 
partially offsetting the nwcp reduction was a refund of premiums previously ceded to the minnesota workers compensation reinsurance association of approximately  direct written premiums for the meridian and citizens security insurance companies during experienced growth of percent and percent  respectively  when compared to volume 
net investment income for increased percent to million in comparison to million for this was attributed to a larger asset base resulting primarily from the acquisition of citizens security group 
the company s pre tax net investment yield for improved slightly to percent from percent one year ago 
the average yield of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  was percent compared to percent at year end during  the company realized net gains on the sale of investments of million  or approximately per common share  versus million  or per share in nearly all of the realized gains recognized over these two years were generated from the sale of equity securities and have an insignificant effect on future investment yields 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of million for were percent higher than the previous year s million 
approximately million of the incurred amount relates to the operations of citizens security group  versus approximately million for the five months of operations in the total 
the statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of the citizens security companies for the period was percent compared to percent for the five months of operations in deteriorations in the citizens security homeowners  private passenger automobile and commercial multi peril lines of business were the primary factors in the loss and loss adjustment expense increase 
partially offsetting these increases were improved experience in the commercial automobile and workers compensation lines 
exclusive of citizens security s operations  incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for the meridian book of business reflected a percent reduction from approximately million in to million in the meridian lines of business for produced a statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of percent  a percentage point improvement from percent for meridian s farmowners  homeowners and commercial multi peril lines of business were the major contributors to the reduced loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  due largely to a reduction in weather related catastrophe losses 
the impact of such catastrophes on the company s loss ratio in and was estimated to be and percentage points  respectively 
general operating and amortization expenses of million for the year ended december  increased percent over the comparable total of million 
substantially contributing to the increase was an additional seven months of operating expenses in related to the citizens security companies 
also contributing to the increased expenses were higher costs related to the company s employee medical plan  and programming and other system costs associated with year compliance 
relative to net earned premiums  the company s expense ratio for was approximately percent compared to percent for the company also incurred approximately  of interest expense in on the bank loan used to finance the citizens security group acquisition 
for the year ended december   the company recorded income tax expense of  compared to  for the low effective tax rate resulted primarily from the amount of tax exempt investment income in relation to pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for liquidity is to pay shareholder dividends  and its main source of liquidity is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations which restrict their ability to pay dividends 
during  meridian security declared and paid dividends to the company of million 
in and  dividends paid to the company were million and million  respectively 
the principal need of the company s insurance subsidiaries for liquid funds is the payment of claims and general operating expenses in the ordinary course of business 
the funds of the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate cash to pay such claims and expenses without forced sales of investments 
the average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is approximately years 
over the next year  a relatively small portion of the company s bond portfolio is scheduled to mature 
given the current interest rate environment  reinvestment of the matured proceeds is likely to be at somewhat lower yields 
approximately percent of the company s investment assets are held in fixed maturities  substantially all of which are believed to be readily marketable 
within the fixed maturity portfolio  the company holds approximately percent in mortgage backed pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has attempted to reduce the prepayment risks associated with mortgage backed securities by investing a majority of the collateralized mortgage obligations in planned amortization and very accurately defined tranches 
these investments are designed to alleviate the risk of prepayment by providing predictable principal prepayment schedules within a designated range of prepayments 
the company s fixed income investment portfolio consists almost entirely of investment grade securities  the average quality of which is rated aa aa 
the company currently holds all of its fixed maturity investments in the available for sale category carried at market value 
the company at december  recorded unrealized gains in the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
at year end  the company recorded unrealized gains on the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
the company s equity security portfolio  which accounts for approximately percent of invested assets  produced unrealized gains  net of deferred income taxes  of approximately million in  compared to approximately million in net unrealized appreciation of investments added to the company s book value per share at december  net unrealized appreciation added per share to the book value at december  the company does have exposure to market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are changes in price for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
the company  with the board of directors  administers and oversees investment risk through the investment committee  which provides executive oversight of investment activities 
the company has specific investment guidelines and policies that define the overall framework used daily by investment portfolio managers to limit the company s exposure to market risk 
the company does not own or currently utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging  enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio  or reducing the cost of its bank debt 
meridian  through its outside professional portfolio managers  employs traditional investment management tools and techniques to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets 
the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market 
credit risk is addressed through adequate diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities 
reinvestment rate risk is controlled through asset liability matching practices and by addressing call characteristics in security selection 
market value risk is addressed through maturity selection 
the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to fluctuations in the level of interest rates 
the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold 
the company estimates that a basis point increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the million market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately percent  or million 
with regard to its million equity security portfolio  the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing 
a decrease in the us equity market prices could result in a decrease of million in the market value of the company s common equities 
these possible declines in values for the bond and stock portfolios would  net of deferred income taxes  negatively affect the common shareholders equity at any point in time  but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as long as operating cash flow and the ongoing emergence of bond maturities continued to provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants  as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level 
on may   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  common shares  or approximately five percent of the company s outstanding common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares  or approximately percent of the authorized total  at a cost of million 
in july  the company completed the acquisition of citizens security group inc of red wing  minnesota 
the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of citizens security group inc and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  meridian citizens security insurance company and insurance company of ohio  for approximately million in cash  including capitalized acquisition costs  and became affiliated with meridian citizens mutual insurance company 
approximately percent of the purchase price was generated from the sale of a portion of the company s investment portfolio 
the remaining million was financed through bank debt and is being amortized over seven years with a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess cost over the fair value of the net assets of approximately million was recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
beginning in  state insurance regulators required companies to calculate risk based capital rbc 
rbc is the capital required to cover the varying degrees of risk inherent in a company s assets  loss reserves  underwriting  and reinsurance 
the company action level rbc is the minimum amount of capital required in order to avoid regulatory action 
the adjusted capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries is well above the required minimum 
impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses is known 
the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation in establishing rates  subject to limitations imposed for competitive pricing 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are management s estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of inflation  the normally higher investment yields available may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
