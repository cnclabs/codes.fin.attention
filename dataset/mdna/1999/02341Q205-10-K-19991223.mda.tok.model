item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
with the exception of the year readiness discussion below  the information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended september  under the heading managements discussion and analysis on pages through year readiness state of readiness 
the year computer issue is real and does impact the way the company s systems perform 
in addition  amcon has business relationships with a number of third parties whose year problems could impact the company 
accordingly  management has recognized the year issue as a major management and technology project 
a task force has been assembled to review all systems to ensure that they do not malfunction as a result of the year issue 
the year project includes review of internal operating systems and equipment  other internal systems and equipment such as telephones  copiers and fax machines and external services and systems that are depended upon to operate the company s business 
in this process  amcon has both replaced some systems and upgraded others 
amcon s internal operating system consists of midrange computers which are used for the sales  accounts receivable and inventory systems 
with the exception of the accounts receivable system  the software operating on the midrange computers does not generally operate or depend upon any date structure  but rather the day of week and week of month 
therefore  software risk to the year issue is considered low 
the remaining accounting systems and other record keeping functions performed by the company are conducted on personal computers which are connected by a local area network 
amcon has engaged third party computer consultants to review  test and modify the midrange computer hardware and software to ensure they will function correctly after december  all software conversions affiliated with the year issue have been completed and management believes that the year problems relating to internal operating systems will be resolved without significant operational difficulties 
baseline testing of all year converted software is completed and deployment of the converted software is substantially complete 
verification that the converted software is functioning properly will continue through december  however  there can be no assurance that testing and verification will discover all potential year problems or that it will not reveal unanticipated material problems with its systems that will need to be resolved 
management has taken steps to ensure that information technology personnel are on site at each location on january  to monitor the systems and make software modifications  if necessary 
other internal systems have been evaluated by amcon s own personnel  along with the providers that service and maintain the systems with emphasis placed on critical systems such as telephone systems 
management believes that all of its internal systems are currently year compliant 
amcon has no control over the efforts of third parties with which we have material business relationships 
amcon has undertaken the process of contacting each major third party to determine their state of readiness for year such parties include  but are not limited to  amcon s suppliers of inventory  customers  financial institutions and utility companies 
amcon has received initial assurances from its major suppliers and financial institutions that they will not be adversely affected by year problems 
costs 
through september   cumulative costs relating directly to year issues have totaled approximately  a portion of the estimated total costs include the cost of existing personnel who have been deployed to work on various phases of the year project 
these costs do not include system upgrades and replacements that were made in the normal course of business 
the deployment of internal resources to the year project has not resulted in significant delays to other major technology projects which were planned by the company 
management estimates that year costs to be incurred subsequent to september  will total approximately  for deployment of year converted software 
risks 
management believes that amcon will have successfully addressed the year problem before december  therefore  management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario will be that one or more of the third parties with which amcon has a material business relationship will not have successfully dealt with its year issues 
a critical third party failure such as telecommunication  utilities or financial institutions could have a material adverse affect on amcon by eliminating our ability to order and pay for products from suppliers and receive orders and payments from customers 
it is also possible that one or more of the internal operating systems will not function properly and make it difficult to complete routine tasks  such as accounting and other record keeping duties 
based on information currently available  management does not believe there will be any long term operating system failures 
however  amcon will continue to monitor these issues as part of its year project and will concentrate its efforts on minimizing their impact 
contingency plans 
amcon has not modified any specific contingency plans with respect to internal operating systems 
basic contingency plans are maintained which address short term operating system failure 
management believes these contingency plans will be sufficient to cover possible operating system disruption caused by year problems 
as amcon completes deployment of the year converted software  these contingency plans will be addressed and modified if necessary 
contingency planning includes  remote dial up connectivity from remote branches in the event that certain telecommunication services fail to operate  direct faxing of orders to the distribution centers and manual routing 
management currently does not foresee contingency planning in the product receiving  selling  order filling and delivery phases of our business as these areas are very labor intensive 
amcon may be required to perform certain accounting and other record keeping functions manually should a year problem become apparent in one or more of those areas 
the company has terminated relationships with third party service providers that were not able to demonstrate that they had successfully resolved their year problems in a timely manner 
there will inevitably be some third parties who will not have made proper year modifications 
amcon s contingency plan only addresses those third parties that are considered critical to its operations 
the foregoing year discussion contains certain forward looking statements  including without limitation anticipated costs and the dates by which amcon expects to substantially complete the modifications and testing of systems and are based upon management s best current estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third parties and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific matters that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained personnel  the ability to identify and convert all relevant computer systems  results of year testing  adequate identification and resolution of year issues by third party service providers  suppliers or customers of amcon  unanticipated system costs  the need to replace additional hardware  the adequacy of and ability to implement contingency plans and similar uncertainties
