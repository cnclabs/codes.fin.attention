results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal decreased million  or from the prior fiscal year  to million 
this decrease is attributable to net sales decreases of at the direct distribution centers and at the full service distribution centers  partially offset by a net sales increase of at the advantage auto stores 
the advantage auto stores net sales increase was the result of the acquisition of two former jobbing store customers and partially offset by the closing of five advantage auto stores and a decrease in comparable store sales 
the net sales decreases in the direct distribution and full service distribution centers is attributable to the softness in the automotive aftermarket parts industry 
this softness is the result of factors such as leasing  improved vehicle performance  warranties and increased competition in the industry 
sales on a comparable location basis declined by in the advantage auto stores  in the direct distribution division and in the full service distribution 
full service distribution decrease was compounded by the purchase of two jobbing customers that are now operated as advantage auto stores 
gross profit declined million or to million in fiscal from million in the previous fiscal year 
gross profit decrease was due to the decline in net sales and the gross profit margin 
gross profit margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  from million in fiscal to million  in the current fiscal year

the decrease in the dollar amount is attributable to the company s ongoing efforts to control expenses and the reductions relative to lower net sales  while the increase in the percentage was caused by lower net sales 
depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations decreased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation expense due to the utilization of operating leases rather than the purchase of fixed assets and to the write off in of capitalized origination costs associated with the company s prior credit facility which was replaced by the company s current credit facility that were being amortized over the term of the prior facility

per share  as compared to income from continuing operations in fiscal of million  or 
per share 
in addition  during fiscal  taking into account the now discontinued autoworks operations  the company incurred a net loss of million  or a share

the cash generated in was primarily the result of the financing of capital asset expenditures  while long term debt payments were offset by increased borrowings on the line of credit 
during fiscal  michael futerman and eli futerman deferred principal payments due from the company under the subordinated notes in the original principal amount of  as a result  in fiscal  the company made interest payments only on the subordinated notes

see note to company s consolidated financial statements 
as of september   the company and fleet capital signed an amendment to the credit facility pursuant to which the company is required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 
for the first three quarters and 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which will be measured on a rolling twelve month basis 
as of december   the company had an outstanding balance of million under the credit facility  with availability of an additional million due to borrowing base restrictions  and was in compliance with all financial covenants 
in the autoworks chapter proceeding  the official unsecured creditors committee committee had indicated that it may pursue certain claims against the company 
on april   a settlement agreement and release was negotiated between the company and the committee 
under the settlement agreement and release  the committee agreed to release the company from all claims in exchange for the company s payment to the autoworks bankruptcy estate of up to a maximum of million over five years 
if certain payments are made in a timely manner  the company will pay less than million  but not less than million by june  the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and release by order dated june  the company made the payments due under the settlement agreement and release in the amount of  on july  and july  in june   the company and the committee entered into a further settlement  pursuant to which the company would continue to maintain ownership of autoworks following the approval of the plan of reorganization  and the company would make an additional payment to the bankruptcy estate in the amount of  in three equal annual installments  without interest 
the first of the three payments is due june  in the future the company may make minor strategic acquisitions and open new direct distribution centers and advantage auto stores to the extent that its debt service and other funding requirements permit 
the company s ability to open new direct distribution centers depends on the company s ability to negotiate extended payment terms with vendors  which initially minimizes additional working capital requirements and on consents from the company s lender 
the company anticipates that its sources of cash flow will provide sufficient working capital to operate its business  make expected capital expenditures and meet its other short term and longer term liquidity needs at least through the end of fiscal year the year issue is the result of computer software programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s software programs  computer hardware or equipment that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in miscalculation or system failures 
the company developed a year plan to ensure that all of its significant date sensitive computer software and hardware systems and other equipment utilized in its various distribution and administrative activities utilizing embedded chips or software  would be year compliant and operational 
the plan addressed all of the company s locations and included a review of computer applications that connect elements of the company s business directly to its customers and suppliers 
the plan also included an assessment process to determine that the company s significant customers and suppliers third party activities would also be year compliant 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue included four major phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
the company has completed all phases of its plan for significant information technology and operating equipment that it believes would be affected by the year issue 
based upon its assessment  the company concluded that it would be necessary to reprogram and or replace certain of its information technology systems 
the company also has determined that certain of its operating equipment would also require modifications to make certain they remain operational 
as of november  the remediation of operating equipment has been substantially completed 
certain desktop personal computers that were year deficient have been replaced as part of the company s scheduled rotation replacement program  the cost of which does not impact the year project 
testing and implementation of the affected equipment has been substantially completed 
as of november   the company has not identified any information technology it or non it system that presents a material risk of not being year ready or for which a suitable alternative could not be implemented 
it is possible that the company may identify potential risks of year disruption in the future 
it is also possible that such a disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has modified or replaced certain time sensitive software programs and other date sensitive devices to avoid a potential inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that governmental agencies  utility companies  internet access companies  third party service providers and others outside the company s control will be yk compliant 
the failure by such entities to be yk compliant could result in a systemic failure beyond the control of the company  such as a prolonged internet  telecommunications or electrical failure  which could decrease the use of the internet or prevent users from accessing the company s iautoparts 
com website  all of which together or in combination could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
with respect to third party activities  the company has made inquiries of its significant customers and suppliers and  at the present time  has not been notified of any significant or substantial difficulties that would materially impact the company s operations 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that these customers and suppliers and in turn their customers and suppliers will be year compliant in a timely manner 
the inability of these parties to successfully resolve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
software modification to the company s mainframe computer system has been completed and tested 
all vendor supplied upgrades have been implemented and tested 
there will be no expense to the company  as modified year software is a part of the company s software maintenance agreement 
personnel expenses were incurred for the implementation and testing phases 
substantially all of the company owned remote store systems have been upgraded with modified year software without cost to the company  as these costs are also covered under the software maintenance agreement for these systems 
personnel and implementation expenses were incurred for these upgrades 
the company utilized both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the required year modifications 
the company has substantially completed the year project including remediation  testing and implementation 
the company s total cost to address the year issue is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flow 
the elements of such costs are as follows amounts in thousands of dollars incurred through costs yet september  to be total incurred cost capital expenditures related to new systems and equipment operating expenses related to modifications of existing systems and equipment total capital and expense there can be no guarantee that the company will not experience disruptions to some aspects of its various activities and operations as a result of non compliant systems utilized by the company or unrelated third parties that were not identified in the original plan 
contingency plans have been completed to attempt to mitigate the extent of any such potential disruption to business operations 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
in general  the company has been able to pass on to its customers any increases in the cost of its inventory 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on the demand for automotive aftermarket products 
historically  the company s net sales and gross profits have been higher in the second half of each fiscal year than in the first half 
important information regarding forward looking statements certain statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts  including but not limited to i anticipated trends in the company s business and the automotive replacement parts industry  ii the sufficiency of cash to fund the company s debt service requirements and working capital needs iii certain statements found under the captions results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and year  are forward looking statements within the meanings of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of  as amended  such statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  plan and similar expressions 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
the actual results of the future events described in the forward looking statements in this form k could materially differ from those contemplated in the forward looking statements in this form k 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties i discussed herein  ii contained in the company s other public reports and filings and public statements from time to time and iii set forth below the company is highly leveraged  with substantial existing indebtedness 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness will depend on its future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  prevailing interest rate levels  and financial  competitive  business and other factors beyond its control 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences  including i the company s future ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes may be limited because of the existence of this indebtedness and the borrowing advance terms thereof  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness until its term loan and supplemental line of credit have been paid in full  thereby reducing funds available for operation  iii certain of the company s borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could cause the company to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates  and iv the company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and may be limited in its ability to respond to changes in the automotive parts industry and competitive pressures 
failure to comply with the company s payment  covenant or other obligations under its credit facilities could result in a default thereunder that  if not cured or waived  could result in acceleration of the relevant indebtedness or of other indebtedness governed by agreements or instruments containing cross default provisions 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and its dollar sales and unit volume could be negatively affected by its ability to maintain or increase prices  changes in sales mix and changes in the demand for automotive products and changes in the automotive replacement parts industry generally  including pricing and other changes by the company s competitors 
the company competes directly and indirectly with numerous distributors  retailers and manufacturers of automotive aftermarket products  some of which distribute in channels that may be expanding in terms of market share relative to the channels in which the company distributes its products 
in addition  some of the company s current and potential competitors are larger  have greater financial resources  and are less leveraged than the company 
furthermore  particularly in light of the trend in the automotive parts industry toward increasing consolidation at the warehouse and jobber levels  the company s financial performance may be significantly affected by the company s ability to compete successfully for associated jobber customers and otherwise take advantage of consolidation opportunities and other trends 
the company s financial performance is subject to and could be negatively impacted by changes in economic conditions  vehicle quality  extension of new parts warranties and maintenance  vehicle scrappage rates and weather conditions  which can cause seasonal variations in the company s results of operations 
the occurrence of violent weather or mild weather may result in significant fluctuations in operating results 
temperature extremes tend to enhance sales by causing a higher incidence of parts failure and increasing sales of seasonal products  while milder weather tends to depress sales 
in light of the trend in the automotive parts industry toward increasing consolidation at the warehouse and jobber levels  the company s financial performance may be significantly affected by the company s ability to compete successfully for associated jobber customers and otherwise take advantage of consolidation opportunities and other industry trends 
the company s ability to do so depends on its ability to secure the consent of its lender to future acquisitions and its ability to finalize such transactions 
if such a transaction is effected  the company s financial performance will depend on its ability to conclude the acquisitions on favorable terms and to enhance those acquisitions and integrate them into its operations 
full realization of the potential benefits of any significant acquisition will be dependent upon a variety of factors  including i retention of a substantial portion of sales  ii achieving sales volumes sufficient to utilize reductions in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  iii achieving significant reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses by  among other things  consolidating redundant operating and administrative facilities and closure of non performing facilities and iv obtaining deferred payment terms and other changeover incentives from suppliers 
there can be no assurance as to the extent to which any such benefits may be realized from any acquisitions or the timing of any such realization 
failure to achieve a substantial portion of such potential benefits within time frames anticipated by the company could materially and adversely affect the company s future results of operations and financial position 
the company s past success has been largely dependent on certain key personnel of the company  including eli n 
futerman and daniel j 
chessin 
the loss of the services of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in order to implement and manage its growth strategy  the company will be dependent upon its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to secure or retain such personnel 
the company is a defendant in various lawsuits 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any of these lawsuits 
to the extent that the company sustains losses growing out of any pending litigation which are presently not reserved or otherwise provided for  its earnings and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
the failure of the company or its material suppliers to effectively address year issues could materially adversely effect its future earnings and liquidity 
other risks and uncertainties which may affect actual results include  but are not limited to  failure of the auto parts e commerce industry to develop at anticipated rates  failure of the company s e commerce products and services to gain significant market acceptance  competition  the ability of the company to protect its proprietary rights  the continued development and viability of the internet and e commerce and the volatility of stock prices of internet focused companies  and hahn automotive warehouse  inc  in particular  and the traffic and usage levels of the iautoparts web site
