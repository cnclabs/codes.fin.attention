item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
change in accounting method effective january   the company elected to convert from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties 
the company believes that the successful efforts method of accounting is preferable  as it more accurately presents the results of the company s exploration and development activities  minimizes asset write offs caused by temporary downward oil and gas price movements and reflects an impairment in the carrying value of its oil and gas properties only when there has been a permanent decline in their fair value 
accordingly  the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the years ended december  and  included in this form k have been restated to conform with successful efforts accounting 
the effect  net of income taxes  was to reduce december   retained earnings by million 
for the statements of income for the years ended december  and  the effect of the accounting change was to decrease net income by million 
per diluted share  and million 
per diluted share  respectively 
results of operations the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by its success in acquiring oil and gas properties and its ability to maintain or increase production through its exploitation and exploration activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices have also significantly affected the company s results 
the following table reflects the company s oil and gas production and its average oil and gas prices for the periods presented years ended december  production oil mbbls us us    argentina    bolivia ecuador total    gas mmcf us us    bolivia   total    total mboe    average sales prices oil per bbl us argentina bolivia ecuador total gas per mcf us us bolivia 
total average us oil prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in the west texas intermediate wti posted prices for oil 
the company s argentina oil production is sold at wti spot prices less a specified differential 
the company experienced a percent decrease in its average oil price in compared to the company was not a party to any oil hedges in during  the impact of argentina oil hedges reduced the company s overall average oil price cents to per bbl and its average argentina oil price was reduced cents to per bbl 
approximately percent of the argentina oil production was covered by hedges 
oil hedges reduced the company s overall average oil price to per bbl 
the company s average us oil price was reduced to per bbl while its average argentina oil price was reduced to per bbl 
the company realized an average oil price for which was approximately percent of wti posted prices compared to a realization of percent before the impact of oil hedges of wti posted prices for the year earlier 
however  due to an increase in the differential between wti posted prices and the nymex reference price nymex  the company s average realized prices before hedges declined to percent of nymex in compared to percent of nymex in and percent of nymex in average us gas prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in spot market prices  which may vary significantly by region 
the company s bolivia average gas price is tied to a long term contract under which the base price is adjusted for changes in specified fuel oil indexes 
during  these fuel oil indexes decreased in conjunction with the current low oil price environment 
the company s average gas price for was percent lower than s 
the company s average gas price for was percent higher than s 
average realized gas prices for were negatively impacted by five cents per mcf as a result of certain gas hedges that were in place for  mcf of gas per day for the period january through march the company has previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intends to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which it considers favorable 
during  the company entered into various natural gas basis swaps for the calender year covering a total of  mmbtu of gas per day plus an additional  mmbtu per day for the period of january through october these natural gas basis swaps were used to reduce the company s exposure to increases in the basis differential between the nymex reference price and the company s industry delivery point indexes under which the gas is sold 
relatively modest changes in either oil or gas prices significantly impact the company s results of operations and cash flow 
however  the impact of changes in the market prices for oil and gas on the company s average realized prices may be reduced from time to time based on the level of the company s hedging activities 
based on oil production  a change in the average oil price realized by the company of per bbl would result in a change in net income and cash flow before income taxes on an annual basis of approximately million and million  respectively 
a cent per mcf change in the average price realized by the company for gas would result in a change in net income and cash flow before income taxes on an annual basis of approximately million and million  respectively  based on gas production 
period to period comparison year ended december   compared to year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the same period in an increase in the company s oil and gas production of eight percent on an equivalent barrel basis was more than offset by a percent decrease in average oil prices and a percent decrease in average gas prices 
the production increases primarily relate to the exploration activities in the united states  the exploitation activities in argentina and the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties from burlington resources inc the burlington properties in april however  a portion of the production increases were reduced by the impact of severe weather in california during the first quarter of and the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of forcing the company to temporarily shut in some of its oil and gas properties for portions of reducing production by approximately  bbls of oil and  mcf of gas 
oil and gas sales decreased million percent  to million for from million for a percent decrease in average oil prices  partially offset by a six percent increase in oil production  accounted for a decrease of million 
a percent decrease in average gas prices  partially offset by an percent increase in gas production  accounted for an additional decrease of million 
oil and gas gathering net margins decreased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the sale by the company of its two largest gathering systems in december and june lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million percent  to million for from million for the increase in lease operating expenses is in line with the eight percent increase in production and is due primarily to operating costs associated with the burlington properties and costs in related to storm damage repair and cleanup as a result of the severe weather in california and the gulf of mexico 
lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel produced decreased to in from for the same period in exploration costs increased million percent  to million for from million for during  the company s exploration costs included million for the acquisition of d seismic data primarily in the us gulf coast area and bolivia  million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling  million for lease impairments and million in other geological and geophysical costs 
the company s exploration costs consisted primarily of million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling  million in d seismic acquisition costs  and million in lease impairments 
impairments of oil and gas properties of million were recognized in  compared to million of impairments in  due primarily to the decline in oil prices which took place in the last quarter of the company reviews its proved properties for impairment on a field basis and recognizes an impairment whenever events or circumstances such as declining oil and gas prices indicate that the properties carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated based on the company s estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves on a field basis  then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
in estimating the future net revenues  the company assumed future oil and gas prices and costs would escalate annually and that the current low oil and gas price environment would return to more historical levels over a period of time 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is possible that the company s assumptions regarding oil and gas prices may change in the future 
if future price expectations were to be reduced  it is possible that additional significant impairment provisions for oil and gas properties would be required 
general and administrative expenses increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the addition of personnel as a result of the acquisition of the burlington properties and the company s increased emphasis on exploration activities  and additional costs associated with international acquisition and business development activities and unsuccessful acquisition activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the eight percent increase in production on an equivalent barrel basis and the increase in the company s dd a rate 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel produced for was compared to for the year earlier 
interest expense increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to a percent increase in the company s total average outstanding debt as a result of capital spending in the company s exploitation and exploration programs in excess of s cash flow and the acquisition of the burlington properties in april the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in the company s overall average interest rate from in to in year ended december   compared to year ended december  net income was million for the year ended december   up percent from million in increases in the company s oil and gas production of percent on an equivalent barrel basis  an increase of percent in natural gas prices  and an increase of two percent in oil prices are primarily responsible for the increase in net income 
the production increases primarily relate to the acquisition of the burlington properties  exploitation activities in argentina  exploration activities in the galveston bay area  the acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties from conoco  inc and exxon company  usa and the acquisition of percent of the common stock of vintage petroleum boliviana  inc vintage boliviana formerly shamrock ventures boliviana ltd 
collectively  the acquisitions 
oil and gas sales increased million percent  to million for from million for a percent increase in oil production and a two percent increase in average oil prices combined to account for million of the increase 
a percent increase in gas production and a percent increase in average gas prices contributed to an additional million increase 
other income expense decreased million  to an expense of million for from income of million for  due primarily to a million charge in related to an adverse judgement in a lawsuit involving the handling of proceeds received by the company from a gas contract termination 
the charge was partially offset by a million gain recognized on the sale of a gas gathering system 
lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million percent  to million for from million for the increase in lease operating expenses is due primarily to costs associated with the burlington properties  the acquisitions  and an increase in severance taxes due to higher oil and gas sales 
lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel produced decreased to in from for exploration costs increased million percent to million for from million for the company s exploration costs included million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling  million for the acquisition of seismic data and million in lease impairments 
the company s exploration costs included million for the acquisition of seismic data  million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and million in lease impairments 
impairments of oil and gas properties of million were recognized in  due primarily to the decline in oil prices which took place in the last quarter of there was no similar impairment provision required in the company reviews its proved properties for impairment on a field basis and recognizes an impairment whenever events or circumstances such as declining oil and gas prices indicate that the properties carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated based on the company s estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
general and administrative expenses increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the acquisition of vintage boliviana  the addition of personnel as a result of the acquisition of the burlington properties and additional costs associated with unsuccessful acquisition activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the percent increase in production on an equivalent barrel basis 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel produced for was compared to for interest expense increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to a percent increase in the company s total average outstanding debt as a result of the acquisition of the burlington properties in april  and the acquisitions made late in the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the company s overall average interest rate from in to in capital expenditures during  the company s domestic oil and gas capital expenditures totaled million 
exploration activities accounted for million of the domestic capital expenditures with exploitation activities contributing million 
the company also had domestic capital expenditures in of million for the acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties  the largest of which was the million acquisition from western gas resources  inc in late october 
during  the company s international oil and gas capital expenditures totaled million  including million in argentina  primarily on exploitation activities  million in bolivia  on exploitation and exploration activities  and million in ecuador related to the acquisition of ehe 
the company committed to perform  work units related to its concession rights in the naranjillos field in santa cruz province  bolivia awarded in late the total work unit commitment was guaranteed by the company through an million letter of credit  however  the company anticipated that it would fulfill this three year work unit commitment through approximately to million of various seismic and drilling capital expenditures 
during  the company spent approximately million in the fulfillment of  work units through the acquisition of seismic data and the drilling of one well 
the company has budgeted to spend approximately million  work units in related to the fulfillment of its naranjillos field commitment 
in addition  the company s commitment to perform  work units related to an exploration program within the chaco block in bolivia was fulfilled during through acquisitions of d seismic and the drilling of two wells 
under the company s exploration contract on block in ecuador  the company is required to participate in the drilling of one additional well 
the company expects to drill the well during at a cost of approximately million 
the company is also committed to spend approximately million in the republic of yemen over a two and one half year period which began in july the expenditures will include the acquisition and interpretation of square kilometers of seismic and the drilling of three exploration wells 
at the end of the first two and one half years  the company has the option to extend the work program for a second two and one half year period with similar work and capital commitments required 
during  approximately million of the million commitment was spent 
the company has budgeted to spend approximately million in on the acquisition of d seismic data in yemen 
except for the commitments discussed above  the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary with no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company uses internally generated cash flow  coupled with advances under its revolving credit facility  to fund capital expenditures other than significant acquisitions 
of the company s non acquisition capital expenditures of million  approximately percent was spent on exploitation activities  including development and infill drilling  and approximately percent was spent on exploration activities 
the company s preliminary capital expenditure budget for is currently set at million  exclusive of acquisitions 
because the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary  should oil and gas prices improve during  its capital expenditure program may be adjusted upward 
the company does not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast 
the company is actively pursuing additional acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
in addition to internally generated cash flow and advances under its revolving credit facility  the company may seek additional sources of capital to fund any future significant acquisitions see liquidity  however  no assurance can be given that sufficient funds will be available to fund the company s desired acquisitions 
the company s recent capital expenditure history is as follows years ended december  in thousands restated restated acquisition of oil and gas reserves    drilling    acquisition of undeveloped acreage and seismic    workovers and recompletions    acquisition and construction of gathering systems   other    total    liquidity internally generated cash flow and the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility are the company s major sources of liquidity 
in addition  the company may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  to fund any major acquisitions it might secure in the future and to maintain its financial flexibility 
in the past  the company has accessed the public markets to finance significant acquisitions and provide liquidity for its future activities 
in conjunction with the purchase of substantial oil and gas assets in  and  the company completed three public equity offerings  as well as a public debt offering in  which provided the company with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in february  the company also completed concurrent public debt and equity offerings 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay a portion of existing indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
on january   the company issued million of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after february  in addition  prior to february   the company may redeem up to of the notes with the proceeds of certain underwritten public offerings of the company s common stock 
the notes mature on june   with interest payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the notes approximately million were used to repay a portion of the existing indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
under the amended and restated credit agreement dated october   as amended the bank facility  certain banks have provided to the company an unsecured revolving credit facility 
the bank facility establishes a borrowing base currently million determined by the banks evaluation of the company s oil and gas reserves 
outstanding advances under the bank facility bear interest payable quarterly at a floating rate based on bank of montreal s alternate base rate as defined or  at the company s option  at a fixed rate for up to six months based on the eurodollar market rate libor 
the company s interest rate increments above the alternate base rate and libor vary based on the level of outstanding senior debt to the borrowing base 
as of february   the company had elected a fixed rate based on libor for a substantial portion of its outstanding advances  which resulted in an average interest rate of approximately percent per annum 
in addition  the company must pay a commitment fee ranging from to percent per annum on the unused portion of the banks commitment 
on a semiannual basis  the company s borrowing base is redetermined by the banks based upon their review of the company s oil and gas reserves 
if the sum of outstanding senior debt exceeds the borrowing base  as redetermined  the company must repay such excess 
any principal advances outstanding under the bank facility at september   will be payable in eight equal consecutive quarterly installments commencing december   with final maturity at september  at february   the unused portion of the bank facility was approximately million based on the current borrowing base of million 
the company anticipates  that as a result of continued low oil and gas prices  the borrowing base will be significantly reduced at the banks next borrowing base redetermination in april however  the amount of any such reduction is unknown at this time 
the unused portion of the bank facility and the company s internally generated cash flow provide liquidity which may be used to finance future capital expenditures  including acquisitions 
as additional acquisitions are made and such properties are added to the borrowing base  the banks determination of the borrowing base and their commitments may be increased 
the company s internally generated cash flow  results of operations and financing for its operations are dependent on oil and gas prices 
for  approximately percent of the company s production was oil 
realized oil prices for the year decreased by percent as compared to as a result  although total production on a boe basis increased by eight percent  the company s earnings and cash flows have been materially reduced compared to to the extent low oil prices continue  the company s earnings and cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted 
the company believes that its cash flows and unused availability under the bank facility are sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  continued low oil and gas prices may cause the company to not be in compliance with maintenance covenants under its bank facility and may negatively affect its credit statistics and coverage ratios and thereby affect its liquidity 
inflation in recent years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
income taxes the company realized a current benefit for income taxes of approximately million for and incurred a current provision of million for the total provision for us income taxes is based on the federal corporate statutory income tax rate plus an estimated average rate for state income taxes 
earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income taxes 
no us deferred tax liability will be recognized related to the unremitted earnings of these foreign subsidiaries as it is the company s intention  generally  to reinvest such earnings permanently 
as of december   the company had estimated net operating loss nol carryforwards of million for argentina income tax reporting purposes which can be used to offset future taxable income in argentina 
the carryforward amount includes certain argentina nol carryforwards million which were acquired and are recorded at cost million  which is less than the calculated value for the tax effect of these carryforwards million under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
these unrecorded nol carryforwards million will reduce the company s foreign income tax provision for financial purposes in future years by approximately million if their benefit is realized 
at the time the company acquired a controlling interest in cadipsa  sa cadipsa and percent of vintage oil argentina  inc voa in  cadipsa and voa had combined tax nol carryforwards of approximately million 
as the acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations and cadipsa and voa had suffered cumulative losses in recent years prior to the acquisition  the company was required by the provisions of sfas to place a valuation allowance on the carryforwards until it could be shown that it reasonably expected to utilize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
during  a substantial benefit million was realized from the utilization of argentina nol carryforwards for tax purposes 
as of the end of  cadipsa and voa had shown cumulative profits for the prior three year period  and based on estimated cash flows based on industry existing conditions at december   the company believed it would be able to fully utilize percent of the remaining tax nol carryforwards 
it therefore reversed the remaining million of the valuation allowance against its argentina deferred tax asset in relating to the remaining unutilized carryforwards as of december  as a result of the significant decline in oil prices in  primarily in the fourth quarter  the company currently believes that of the million of argentina nol carryforwards generated by cadipsa and voa  million will expire in unutilized and has therefore recorded a valuation allowance against its argentina deferred tax asset of approximately million in related to these carryforwards 
the company has a us federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward of approximately million which does not expire and is available to offset us federal regular income taxes in future years  but only to the extent that us federal regular income taxes exceed the amt in such years 
the company incurred a tax nol for us purposes in and will be able to carry back the nol two years and or forward years to receive a refund of prior income taxes paid or to offset future income taxes to be paid

year compliance readers are cautioned that the forward looking statements contained in the following year discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
the disclosures also constitute a year readiness disclosure and year statement within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of the year information and readiness disclosure act of does not insulate the company from liability under the federal securities laws with respect to disclosures relating to year information 
statement of readiness 
the company has undertaken various initiatives to ensure that its hardware  software and equipment will function properly with respect to dates before and after january  for this purpose  the phrase hardware  software and equipment includes systems that are commonly thought of as information technology systems it  as well as those non information technology systems non it and equipment which include embedded technology 
it systems include computer hardware and software and other related systems 
non it systems include certain oil and gas production and field equipment  gathering systems  office equipment  telephone systems  security systems and other miscellaneous systems 
the non it systems present the greatest compliance challenge since identification of embedded technology is difficult and because the company is  to a great extent  reliant on third parties for non it compliance 
the company has formed a year yk project team  which is chaired by its manager of information services 
the team includes corporate staff and representatives from the company s business units 
the phases of identification  assessment  remediation  and testing make up the yk directive 
the following is the company s targeted non it and it compliance time line completion date non it systems and equipment identification phase completed compliance august it systems and equipment identification phase completed compliance august included in the company s yk project are procedures to determine the readiness of its business partners  such as service companies  technology providers  transportation and communication providers  pipeline systems  materials suppliers and oil and gas product purchasers 
by use of questionnaires   notices were distributed which will allow the company to determine the extent to which these business partners are addressing their yk issues 
each returned document is examined for a response that may be detrimental to the company s operations 
to date  approximately  of the company s business partners have responded and those business partners who do not respond and who are considered key businesses in the support of the company s operations will be sent a second request  followed by direct correspondence  to determine their readiness 
any material adverse responses will be reviewed to determine an alternate business partner selection or the need for alternative actions to mitigate the impact on the company 
the cost to address yk issues 
the company believes that the cost of the yk project will not exceed million  excluding costs of company employees working on the yk project 
costs incurred for the purchase of new software and hardware are being capitalized and all other costs are being expensed as incurred 
to date  the company has incurred yk project costs of approximately  the expenditures relate primarily to the upgrading and replacement of existing software and hardware and the use of contract service consultants 
yk worst case scenario 
the company s initial results from its assessment phase of the yk project is that its internal systems have fewer yk compliance problems than initially anticipated 
as the company plans to have all internal systems within its control compliant and tested before the year  it believes its likely worst case scenario is the possibility of operational interruptions due to non compliance by third parties 
this non compliance could cause operational problems such as temporary disruptions of certain production  delays in marketing and transportation of production and delays of payments for oil and gas sales 
this risk should be minimized by the company s efforts to communicate and evaluate third party compliance 
the company is currently developing contingency plans in the event that problems arise due to third party non compliance or any failures of the company s systems 
these plans should be completed by the third quarter of and will include  but are not limited to  backup and recovery procedures  installations of new systems  replacement of current services with temporary manual processes  finding non technological alternatives or sources of information  and finding alternative suppliers  service companies and purchasers 
the risks of yk issues 
the company presently believes that the yk issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if all significant yk issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely  the yk issues may materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition or materially and adversely affect its relationships with its business partners 
additionally  the lack of yk compliance by other entities may have a material and adverse impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells crude oil  natural gas  condensate  natural gas liquids and sulfur 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
the company has previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intends to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which it considers favorable 
during  the company entered into various natural gas basis swaps for the calendar year covering a total of  mmbtu of gas per day plus an additional  mmbtu per day for the period of january through october for a total weighted average differential of approximately one cent below nymex 
these natural gas basis swaps were used to reduce the company s exposure to increases in the basis differential between the nymex reference price and the company s industry delivery point indexes under which the gas is sold 
during the first three months of  the actual basis differential for this same volume of gas was approximately seven and one half cents above nymex 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk exposure results primarily from short term rates  mainly libor based borrowings from its commercial banks 
to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates the company maintains a portion of its total debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
at december   the amount of the company s fixed rate debt was approximately percent of total debt  however  the company issued additional fixed rate debt in january bringing the current fixed rate debt level to percent of total debt 
in the past  the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
the following table provides information about the company s long term debt cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates before the impact of the january fixed rate debt issuance discussed above fair value there at after total long term debt fixed rate in thousands    average interest rate variable rate in thousands      average interest rate a a a a a a libor plus an increment  based on the level of outstanding senior debt to the borrowing base  up to a maximum increment of percent 
current increment above libor is percent 
foreign currency and operations risk international investments represent  and are expected to continue to represent  a significant portion of the company s total assets 
the company has international operations in argentina  bolivia  ecuador and yemen 
for  the company s operations in argentina accounted for approximately percent of the company s revenues  percent of the company s operating income before impairments of oil and gas properties and percent of its total assets 
during such period  the company s operations in argentina represented its only foreign operations accounting for more than percent of its revenues  operating income before impairments of oil and gas properties or total assets 
the company continues to identify and evaluate international opportunities but currently has no binding agreements or commitments to make any material international investment 
as a result of such significant foreign operations  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions or changes in the political climate in these foreign countries 
the company believes argentina offers a relatively stable political environment and does not anticipate any significant change in the near future 
the current democratic form of government has been in place since and  since  has pursued a steady process of privatization  deregulation and economic stabilization and reforms involving the reduction of inflation and public spending 
argentina s month trailing inflation rate measure by the argentine consumer price index declined from percent as of june to a negative percent as of december all of the company s argentine revenues are us dollar based  while a large portion of its costs are denominated in argentine pesos 
the argentina central bank is obligated by law to sell dollars at a rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar and has sought to prevent appreciation of the peso by buying dollars at rates of not less than peso to one us dollar 
as a result  the company believes that should any devaluation of the argentine peso occur  its revenues would be unaffected and its operating costs would not be significantly increased 
at the present time  there are no foreign exchange controls preventing or restricting the conversion of argentine pesos into dollars 
since the mid s  bolivia has been undergoing major economic reform  including the establishment of a free market economy and the encouragement of foreign private investment 
economic activities that had been reserved for government corporations were opened to foreign and domestic private investments 
barriers to international trade have been reduced and tariffs lowered 
a new investment law and revised codes for mining and the petroleum industry  intended to attract foreign investment  have been introduced 
on february   a new currency  the boliviano bs  replaced the peso at the rate of one million pesos to one boliviano 
the exchange rate is set daily by the government s exchange house  the bolsin  which is under the supervision of the bolivian central bank 
foreign exchange transactions are not subject to any controls 
the us bs exchange rate at december   was us bs 
the company believes that any currency risk associated with its bolivian operations would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
prior to the company s acquisition of ehe in november  its previous operations in ecuador were through a farm in exploration joint venture with two other companies in block the economy of ecuador has been uneven in recent years and has recently reached a crisis level  due in large part to decreases in oil prices and damage from el nino floods 
since  the government has generally sought to reduce its participation in the economy and has implemented certain macroeconomic reforms which were designed to reduce inflation 
the company believes the current government has a favorable attitude toward foreign investment and has strong international relationships with the us due to the current economic crisis  the sucre ecuador s monetary unit has lost approximately percent of its value so far this year and inflation has reached nearly percent 
president jamil mahaud announced march   a comprehensive economic plan that calls for an increase in the value added tax from percent to percent and the freezing of ecuadorian bank accounts for one year 
furthermore  the ecuadorian government is likely to implement a convertibility plan similar to that adopted by argentina in  whereby the sucre will be tied to the us dollar 
earlier this year the income tax was replaced by a one percent tax on all financial transactions 
the purpose of the reform is to reduce tax evasion and increase tax collection by the government  without increasing the tax burden on taxpayers 
although the company believes any currency risk associated with its operations in ecuador would not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations  it has policies in place that will reduce its exposure to currency risk in ecuador
