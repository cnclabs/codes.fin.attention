costs associated with this plan consist of million of fixed asset write offs and million of lease exit and other incremental exit costs 
the net cash impact of this plan in fiscal is expected to be minimal  as cash restructuring costs will likely be offset by inventory reduction and operating loss reduction associated with the store closings 
the company anticipates that all remaining closures will be substantially completed in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s restructuring plans and note for further information regarding discontinued operations

interest expense increased  or  in fiscal due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings  primarily to support new store operating and capital cash needs 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the variation in the effective rate for the tax benefit in fiscal and the tax provision in is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance to account for certain international deferred tax assets 
as a result of the foregoing  the company had a net loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of million in fiscal compared to net income from continuing operations of  in fiscal the net loss from discontinued operations reflects the operating losses of eyex  the company s optical segment  net of taxes 
the estimated loss from disposal of discontinued operations of million  net of taxes  reflects the estimated loss to dispose of eyex  including costs to dispose of inventory and store locations  and the estimated remaining operating losses through closure 
the company reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources the company s short term cash needs are primarily for i working capital to support its inventory requirements and new store additions ii the implementation of its restructuring plans and iii common stock repurchases  as authorized by the company s board of directors 
the company s long term liquidity requirements relate principally to the maturity of its revolving credit facility in november  the maturity of its million convertible subordinated notes in june  operating lease commitments and continued store expansion 
in april  the company entered into a revolving credit with borrowing availability of up to million  depending on inventory levels  with bankboston retail finance inc bankboston  which replaced its former revolving credit agreement 
bankboston s commitment to fund revolving credit borrowings based on inventory levels was reduced to million effective february  in november  the company amended this facility to incorporate a supplemental borrowing facility 
as of april   the company s borrowing base was approximately million and the company was entitled to borrow up to an additional million under the supplemental component of its facility 
the credit facility includes up to million in letters of credit 
borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at the company s option  a the prime rate or b libor plus 
the facility is secured with a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all assets 
borrowings under the bankboston facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including stock repurchases which purchases are subject to a minimum remaining borrowing availability of million 
due to the seasonal nature of the company s business  outstanding borrowings typically peak during the first and third fiscal quarters as the company finances inventory purchases in advance of the company s highest sales periods 
see seasonality and quarterly results 
at january   the company had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of million and million in letters of credit outstanding  which were maintained as security for performance under the company s executive office lease and for purchases of certain merchandise 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the difference between the company s net income and operating cash flow in fiscal was primarily attributable to the reduction in inventory of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and the decrease in other current assets due to tax refunds of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal investing cash flows reflect capital expenditures related to new store expansion and acquisitions  the renovation of existing stores and required systems enhancements 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal financing cash flows for reflect stock repurchases of million 
at january   the company s commitments for capital expenditures totaled million and are related primarily to capital costs for new store construction and existing store renovations 
management believes that net cash provided by operations  together with borrowing availability under the company s credit facility  will be sufficient to fund estimated capital expenditures associated with the company s planned opening of approximately store locations in fiscal  amounts associated with the company s common stock repurchase program and other working capital requirements  including cash expenditures associated with the company s restructuring activities  through at least fiscal seasonality and quarterly results historically  the company s operations have been seasonal  with highest net sales and net income occurring in the second fiscal quarter reflecting increased demand for sunglasses during the spring and summer months 
the company s results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of sales contributed by new stores  the integration of new stores into the operations of the company and the timing of planned store closures  as well as other factors 
the addition of a large number of new stores can affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding quarterly financial data 
year compliance the company recognizes that the arrival of the year poses a unique challenge to the ability of many technical systems to process the date change from december   to january  the yk issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define an applicable year 
these programs  if not corrected  could fail or create erroneous results after the century date change 
the yk issue is believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations 
the company utilizes software  hardware  and related technologies throughout its business that will be affected by the yk date change 
the company has established a yk project team  which is currently addressing the impact of yk on its systems and business processes 
the project team focuses on four areas information systems and technology  merchandise vendors  third party suppliers  and corporate facilities 
the project plan in each area includes the following phases assessment inventory  risk analysis  remediation  testing  and implementation 
a risk based approach is being employed to prioritize and direct the internal and external resources dedicated to the yk initiative 
information systems technology based on an enterprise wide risk analysis completed at the end of fiscal  the following critical application systems areas are the focus of the company s yk compliance efforts merchandising  inventory management  point of sale systems  human resources including payroll  and financial information 
during the past few years  the company has undergone significant strategic improvements in its application systems in order to improve business processes 
the merchandising  human resources  and financial information systems were selected for improved business functionality and are vendor certified as yk compliant 
the human resources and financial information systems were implemented during and the merchandising system will be implemented by mid all critical functions will be tested to ensure the asserted compliance 
additionally  the hardware and communications infrastructure has been inventoried  assessed and  where necessary  is currently being upgraded and tested 
the remaining systems and processes are in various stages of remediation through implementation 
the remediation  testing  and implementation phases can run concurrently within system projects as well as overall for all system areas  however  implementation for all mission critical systems is expected to be substantially complete by the third quarter of the fiscal year 
merchandise vendors  third party vendors  and corporate facilities the company s operations are dependent on the yk readiness of third parties 
in particular  the sales systems interact with commercial electronic transaction processing systems to handle customer credit card purchases and other point of sale transactions 
additionally  the company relies on third party suppliers for infrastructure elements such as telephone services  electric power  water  and banking facilities  as well as merchandise suppliers for the delivery of goods to sell 
the vendor relations area of the project refers to the yk status evaluation of key merchandise and service vendors 
as part of the yk initiative  merchandise and service vendors are being surveyed to determine their readiness and the company is in the process of obtaining or negotiating to obtain assurances from these vendors 
in addition  because the company depends heavily on a select group of merchandise vendors  the company will conduct more in depth assessments of certain of these mission critical vendors to further assess such vendors progress 
where necessary  contingency plans will be developed to be used in the event of supplier delivery delay or failure 
although the company has not been put on notice that any known third party s problem will not be resolved  the company has limited information and no assurance of additional information concerning the yk readiness of third parties 
the resulting risks to the company s business are very difficult to assess  however  the inability to obtain merchandise from one or more key vendors on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is developing contingency plans and identifying what actions would be required if a critical system  service provider  or merchandise vendor were not yk compliant 
the company expects these plans to be finalized by the third quarter of and will re evaluate these plans throughout the balance of fiscal costs to date  the company estimates that it has spent approximately  on yk efforts across all areas and expects to spend an additional   to complete the project  which amounts will be funded through operating cash flows 
operating costs related to yk compliance projects will be incurred over several quarters and will be expensed as incurred 
costs associated with business system solutions for improved business processes are not included in these amounts 
the company does not anticipate that these amounts will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
the costs of the project and the dates on which the company plans to complete the work are based on management s best estimates  which were derived from numerous assumptions about future events  including the availability of certain resources  third party compliance information  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained personnel  the ability to identify and correct all relevant technologies  and the ability to acquire accurate information regarding third party suppliers 
additionally  yk expenditures in relation to total estimated costs should not be considered or relied on as a basis for estimating progress to completion for any element of the yk project 
the company presently believes that upon remediation of its business software applications  hardware  and other equipment with embedded technology  the yk issue will not present a materially adverse risk to the company s future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources 
however  if such remediation is not completed in a timely manner or the level of timely compliance by key suppliers or vendors is not sufficient  the yk issue could have a material impact on the company s operations including  but not limited to  failures to or delays in delivery of merchandise resulting in loss of business 
european monetary union on january  eleven of the existing members of the european union the eu joined the european monetary union the emu 
this will lead to  among many other things  fundamental changes in the way participating eu states implement their monetary policies and manage local currency exchange rates 
ultimately  there will be a single currency within certain countries of the eu  known as the euro and one organization  the european central bank  responsible for setting european monetary policy 
while some believe that the change will bring a higher level of competition within europe and a greater sense of economic stability within that region  there is no certainty that the company s activity in this region will necessarily realize any benefits as a result of such changes 
the company has reviewed the impact the euro will have on its business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in its commercial operations or treasury management functions 
while it is uncertain whether there will be any immediate direct benefits from the planned conversion  the company believes it is properly prepared to accommodate any changes deemed necessary without any significant changes to its current commercial operations  treasury management and management information systems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on a limited basis  the company selectively uses foreign currency swap agreements to hedge the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on certain short term intercompany transactions 
no derivative contracts are entered into for trading or speculative purposes 
the use of derivatives did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in fiscal  or see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information
