general the profitability of the company  and more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charge fees and commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  equipment and technology related expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
effect of federal laws and redulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and have increased competition among savings institutions  commercial banks  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
on june   the bank became a state chartered trust company and the company became a bank holding company 
this change brought with it an additional set of regulations and new regulators for the bank and company 
the new regulators may have different areas of emphasis when evaluating the operations of the company or the bank than the prior regulators 
while this change may cause the company or the bank to make changes in the way they conduct business  these changes are not expected to be material to the overall operations or profitability of the company 
recent changes in accounting principles the fasb recently adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement establishes standards for reporting operating segments and requires certain other disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company implemented sfas no 
during the six months ended december  with no material impact on the company s financial statements 
potential impact of accounting principles to be implemented in the future the fasb recently adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance 
sfas no 
may not be applied retroactively 
management believes adopting sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements year issues the year issue confronting the company and its suppliers  customers and competitors  centers on the inability of computer systems to recognize the year many existing computer programs and systems were originally programmed with six digit dates that provided only two digits to identify the calendar year in the date field 
with the impending new millennium  these programs and computers may recognize as the year rather than the year financial institution regulators have recently increased their focus upon year compliance issues and have issued guidance concerning the responsibilities of senior management and directors 
the fdic and the other federal banking regulators have issued safety and soundness guidelines to be followed by insured depository institutions  such as the bank  to assure resolution of any year problems 
the federal banking agencies have asserted that year testing and certification is a key safety and soundness issue in conjunction with regulatory exams  and thus an institution s failure to address appropriately the year issue could result in supervisory action  including such enforcement actions as the reduction of the institution s supervisory ratings  the denial of applications for approval of a merger or acquisition  or the imposition of civil money penalties 
the bank has experienced rapid growth in both the deposit and loan areas in recent years 
management of the bank evaluated the need to upgrade the mission critical systems and determined conversion to a new hardware and software system was the best solution to meet the growth needs of the bank as well as to resolve the year issues 
during the six months ended december   the bank completed the conversion to the jack henry silverlake system for its core processing system and internal financial reporting system 
the new system has been certified year compliant  was tested by the bank for year compliance in early and is believed to be year compliant 
as an integral part of upgrading the core system  the company has also been in a program of replacing its personal computers and wide area networks with systems believed to be year compliant systems 
this program was also completed during the six months ended december  a complete inventory of non mission critical hardware and software was completed in december non compliant software systems are scheduled for replacement or will be discontinued 
security systems  elevators  heating and air conditioning and like items have been tested and are expected to function as usual through the date of change 
third party vendors deemed appropriate will continue to be used and have indicated their products as compliant 
testing of these and certain other systems is scheduled for completion no later than june  a budget of million was established to complete the necessary steps previously noted 
approximately million has been spent to date  with approximately  of these costs being expensed in the six months ended december  and the remaining amount being capitalized and amortized over a to year period 
management feels these expenses will not have a material impact on the financial condition of the company 
an outside consultant has been utilized throughout the process to provide an independent review of all areas 
the company s estimate of year project costs and completion dates are based on management s best estimates that have been derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events 
these estimates and actual results may differ materially 
the insurance  investment and travel subsidiaries operate on separate computer systems from the bank and each other 
the year committee of the bank has been assisting these companies in performing a risk assessment of their systems and taking the steps believed necessary to achieve compliance with all year issues before december  while the company believes that its systems and technology will be compliant on january and thereafter  it faces an unquantifiable risk that third parties such as customers will encounter year problems that cause them to reduce their use of bank services  default on loans  or reduce levels of future borrowings 
there is also a risk that other financial organizations that the company maintains relations with could experience year issues that would adversely affect the company 
finally  if other service providers  such as public utilities or telephone companies  are not year compliant  the company could experience service interruptions that would make the conduct of business difficult 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address some of these uncertainties 
it may employ back up generators as needed to provide electric power beginning january  it plans to have in place a cellular based modern communications system at key branches to maintain communication with its data service providers in the event that landline communications are disrupted 
immediately before the change of the century  electronic trial balances with extended information are to be downloaded for import into local database systems 
a complete backup of all files will be performed before the century change  and critical information is expected to be printed in hard copy 
the company anticipates taking other steps to assure both liquidity and security 
the company believes its has completed the majority of the actions necessary to achieve year compliance for its core systems and the majority of the work necessary to achieve overall compliance 
the company expects that it will be year compliant before the century date change 
there remains  however  the possibility that problems encountered by third parties  including customers  financial organizations and other service providers  could adversely affect the company 
asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   the ratio of great southern s one year gap to total assets was a positive and its ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the board of directors sets and recommends the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the president and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions  and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the president or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors  at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability committee may determine to increase great southern s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain its net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
interest rate risk exposure estimates are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and would therefore cause a change which potentially could be material in the company s interest rate risk 
the following schedule illustrates the expected maturities of the bank s financial instruments at december  this schedule does not reflect the effects of possible prepayments or enforcement of due on sale clauses 
the table is based on information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

substantially all the change was due to an increase in net loans of million 
the main loan areas experiencing increase were commercial real estate  residential construction and consumer 
total liabilities increased million from june  to december   primarily from an increase in deposits of million  offset by a decrease in federal home loan bank fhlbank advances of million 
the deposit increase was primarily from brokered deposits which were obtained to fund the increased loan levels and and also used to pay down fhlbank advances 
management feels fhlbank advances and brokered deposits are viable alternatives to retail deposits when factoring all the costs associated with the generation and maintenance of retail deposits 
in addition  brokered deposits have become more attractive in recent years with the low level of fdic deposit insurance 
also  brokered deposits do not require any collateral pledging while fhlbank advances require the pledging of collateral at levels greater than the funds being obtained 
stockholders equity increased million primarily as a result of net income of million offset by dividend declarations and payments of million  net treasury stock purchases of million and a reduction of  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company repurchased a net of  shares of common stock during the six month period 
results of operations and comparison for the six months ended december  and general the decrease in earnings of  or  during the six months ended december  compared to december   was primarily due to an increase in non interest expense of million  or  an increase in provision for income taxes of  or  and an increase in provision for loan losses of  or  offset by an increase in net interest income of million  or  and an increase in non interest income of million  or during the six months ended december  total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the six months ended december  primarily due to a million  or  increase in interest income on loans 
interest income loans during the six months ended december  compared to december   interest income on loans increased primarily from higher average balances 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from million during the six months ended december  to million during the six months ended december  the higher average balance resulted from the bank s increased lending in commercial real estate  commercial business lending and indirect dealer consumer lending 
the average yield on loans increased from during the six months ended december   to during the six months ended december  as a result of the change in the mix of loan types to higher rate loans 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and interest earning deposits decreased  or  during the six months ended december  when compared to the six months ended december  interest income declined  as a result of lower average yields from during the six months ended december   to during the six months ended december  due to lower short term market rates 
interest income increased  as a result of higher average balances from million during the six months ended december  to million in the six months ended december  total interest expense total interest expense increased  or  during the six months ended december  when compared with the six months ended december  primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of million  or  offset by a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances and other borrowings of  or 
interest expense deposits interest expense on time deposits increased million as a result of higher average balances from million during the six months ended december   to million during the six months ended december  the average balances of time deposits increased primarily as a result of the company s use of brokered and other time deposits to fund loan growth 
in recent years  brokered deposit rates have become competitive with rates on fhlbank advances and larger retail deposits 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on time deposits of  as a result of lower average rates from during the six months ended december  to during the six months ended december  interest expense on deposits increased  as a result of higher average balances of interest bearing demand deposits from million during the six months ended december   to million during the six months ended december   and increased  as a result of higher average rates on interest bearing demand deposits from during the six months ended december   to during the six months ended december  the increase in balances was the result of the growth of checking customers and the increase in rate was the result of a change in the mix of account types 
this increase was partially offset by a  decrease in interest expense on savings accounts from slightly lower average rates from in the six months ended december  to during the six months ended december  interest expense fhlbank advances and other borrowings interest expense on fhlbank advances and other borrowings decreased  principally due to lower average balances from million during the six months ended december  to million during the six months ended december  these lower average balances resulted from the increase in deposits noted above that were partially used to repay maturing fhlbank advances 
average rates were lower during the six months ended december  at compared to during the six months ended december  net interest income the company s overall interest rate spread increased from during the six months ended december   to during the six months ended december  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased  or  during the six months ended december  from  during the six months ended december  to million during the six months ended december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions and regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
non performing assets increased million  or  from million at june  to million at december  non performing loans increased million  or  from million at june  to million at december   and foreclosed assets declined million  or  from million at june  to million at december  potential problem loans increased million  or  from million at june  to million at december  these are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems which may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current loan repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in the non performing loans 
management considers the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for foreclosed asset losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s assets at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non interest income non interest income increased million  or  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase in service charge income of  or  on transaction accounts and electronic transactions due to increased volumes from atm debit card usage  ii an increase of  or  in commission income from the travel  insurance and investment subsidiaries from growth in these areas  offset by  iii a decrease of  or in net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities  iv various increases or decreases in other non interest income items 
non interest expense non interest expense increased million  or during the six months ended december  when compared to the six months ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase of  in salaries and employee related costs due to increased staffing levels in most areas of the company due to growth and the year issue  ii an increase of  in occupancy and equipment expense primarily due to computer system upgrades and other technology related purchases partially due to the year issue  iii an increase of  in transaction and bad check losses from a regulatory recommendation to charge off these losses at days  and ix various increases or decreases in other non interest expense items 
in conjunction with the company s recent growth and the year issue discussed previously in this document  the company will be incurring additional operating costs associated with the evaluation  purchase  implementation and operation of new mainframe hardware and software as well as other replacement computer and equipment items 
in addition  it is probable that the insurance  investment and travel subsidiaries will incur costs in the evaluation  purchase  implementation and operation of their systems to bring them into compliance to avoid potential year issues 
while the exact impact of the cost to correct or convert the various systems of the company is not known at this time  management does not feel it will be material to the overall operations or financial condition of the company 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income increased from in the six months ended december  to in the six months ended december  the lower than normal percentage in the december  period was primarily due to a refund of prior period state financial institution taxes within that period

interest income loans during fiscal  interest income on loans increased primarily from higher average balances 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from million during fiscal to million during fiscal the higher average balance resulted from the bank s increased lending in commercial real estate and commercial business lending and entry into the indirect dealer consumer lending offset by a decline in single family residential lending 
the average yield on loans increased from during fiscal  to during fiscal as a result of the change in the mix of loan types 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and interest earning deposits increased  or  during fiscal when compared to fiscal interest income increased  as a result of higher average balances from million during fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily in interest bearing deposits in fhlbank used to fund daily operations and lending

in recent years  brokered deposit rates have become competitive with rates on fhlbank advances and larger retail deposits 
interest expense on deposits increased  as a result of higher average balances of interest bearing demand deposits from million during fiscal  to million during fiscal this increase in balances was the result of the rapid growth of personal checking customers during the fiscal year 
the bank experienced this growth in large part due to acquisitions of competitors by larger banking institutions 
this increase was partially offset by a  decrease in interest expense from slightly lower average rates from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to the change of the deposit mix 
interest expense fhlbank advances and other borrowings interest expense on fhlbank advances and other borrowings increased  due to higher average balances from million during fiscal to million during fiscal these higher average balances resulted from the use of fhlbank advances for funding a portion of the loan growth previously mentioned

non interest income non interest income increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to i an increase of million in profits on sale of available for sale securities  ii an increase in service charge income of million  or  on transaction accounts and electronic transactions due to increased volumes from an expanded atm network and special promotions on debit card usage  iii an increase of  or  in commission income from the travel  insurance and investment subsidiaries from growth in these areas  iv an increase of  in profits on sale of loans from increased levels of fixed rate loan refinancing due to historically low rates  and v various increases and decreases in other non interest income items 
non interest expense non interest expense increased only slightly during fiscal when compared to fiscal  however  there were some major increases and decreases within non interest expense items between the two fiscal periods 
the changes were i a decrease in insurance of million due to the payment in fiscal of the one time saif assessment of thrifts in september  and ii a decrease in goodwill amortization of million due to the write off in fiscal of goodwill remaining from a failed thrift purchase  offset by iii an increase of  in tax consulting fees paid to achieve a one time million reduction of state financial institution taxes  iv an increase of million in salaries and employee related costs due to increased staffing levels in transaction processing areas and expanded consumer and commercial lending  both resulting from substantial asset and customer growth  v an increase of  in occupancy and equipment expense primarily due to expansion of the company s atm network and other technology related purchases  vi an increase of  in robbery and bad check losses  vii an increase of  in audit  accounting and supervisory exam fees from increased time in these areas and a previous under accrual  viii an increase of  in package transaction account benefit costs due to the increased number of personal checking customers  and ix increases in the majority of other non interest expense items resulting from asset and earnings growth 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the in fiscal would have been without the non deductible goodwill write off that occurred during the period 
a large portion of the lower than normal percentage in the june  period was due to a refund of prior period state financial institution taxes of million 
the refund was the result of a review of the bank s state financial institution tax returns by a consulting firm 
the refund resulted from the bank s charter change from a state charter to a federal savings bank charter in december an additional current year reduction of  resulted from the bank s charter change at june  from a federal savings bank charter to a state trust company charter

these obligations include the credit needs of customers  funding deposit withdrawals  and the day to day operations of the company 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans 
as a result of the company s management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
at december   the company had commitments of approximately million to fund loan originations  issued lines of credit  outstanding letters of credit and unadvanced loans 
management continuously reviews the capital position of the company and the bank to insure compliance with minimum regulatory requirements  as well as exploring ways to increase capital either by retained earnings or other means
