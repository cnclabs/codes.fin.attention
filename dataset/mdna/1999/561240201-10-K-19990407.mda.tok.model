the financial information discussed below is consolidated information  which includes the accounts of laguna in as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  because the company s interest in laguna was reduced from an approximate interest at the beginning of the year ended december   to less than a majority interest by the end of the year  the company de consolidated laguna from the company s financial statements and accounted for its investment in laguna using the equity method of accounting 
pursuant to applicable sec rules  a restatement of years prior to to reflect the de consolidation is not permitted 
overview the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth will be substantially dependent upon its drilling success in the san juan and delaware basins  and prevailing prices for oil and gas  which are in turn dependent upon numerous factors that are beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the energy markets have historically been volatile  and there can be no assurance that oil and gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and gas reserves that the company may economically produce 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operations are capital intensive 
historically  the company s principal sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  a revolving line of credit and proceeds from sales of common and preferred stock 
the company s principal uses of capital have been for the exploration  acquisition  development and exploitation of oil and gas properties 
during fourth quarter  the company realized net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in a public offering 
a portion of the proceeds were used to repay substantially all of the company s long term bank debt 
at the beginning of  the company had million in net working capital  including million in cash and cash equivalents  and virtually no long term debt 
the company s oil and gas capital expenditures were million and its net cash provided by operations was million 
the remainder of s capital expenditures were funded primarily through borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit described below and two term loans negotiated during the company closed with a working capital deficit of million and long term debt of million 
the company is currently in the process of securing additional capital to enable it to continue its active drilling and development program through the following sources of capital are under active consideration bank borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  the sale of preferred stock or other equity securities  the issuance of production based financing or net profits interests  and joint venture financing 
the company is working with its bank to establish a drilling line of credit  which would be in addition to its current credit relationships 
a drilling line  if arranged  would bear a higher interest rate than the revolving line of credit described below 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the financing it seeks upon satisfactory terms 
during  the company completed of development wells and three of five exploratory wells drilled 
in addition  the company recompleted wells in in first quarter  two exploratory wells were successfully completed and one exploratory well is still being tested 
the company is in the process of establishing its budget for to incorporate the results from the drilling of six wells on its la jara canyon acreage in the san juan basin and the capital that it will have available 
in march  the company established a revolving line of credit the revolver with bank one  texas  na the bank 
the borrowing base under the revolver is subject to redetermination every six months  or at such other times as the bank may determine 
the revolver  which is secured by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties  expires april  in october  the revolver s borrowing base was established at million 
at december   borrowings under the revolver were million  leaving available additional borrowings of million 
as of march   the outstanding balance under the revolver was million  leaving available additional borrowings of million 
the revolver requires that the company maintain certain financial and other covenants  including a minimum current ratio  a minimum net equity  and a debt service ratio 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the minimum net equity and the debt service ratio covenants 
the bank has agreed to waive the company s non compliance with both the minimum net equity and the debt service ratio covenants for the quarter ended december  moreover  the bank has agreed to waive any non compliance with the debt service ratio that may occur during calendar year and to amend the minimum net equity covenant in such a way that management believes that  based on its current projections  the company will meet it for all reporting periods in in addition to the revolver  during  the company negotiated two term loans with its bank 
the company drew  on the first term loan to finance the purchase of land and a building for the company s field office in carlsbad  new mexico 
principal and interest of is payable quarterly  beginning october  the company drew million under the second term loan to finance equipment for the company s gas processing plant 
principal and interest payments are payable monthly  beginning on november   over years 
interest on the million term loan is libor plus 
the company entered into a year interest rate swap agreement that will effectively fix the interest rate on the term loan at 
the million notional amount of the interest rate swap declines monthly by the amount of principal payments 
the company paid a total of  in principal payments during on the two term loans 
mandatory redemption of the company s series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock the series b stock was to begin in april  when of the outstanding shares  or  shares  were to be redeemed for  in march  the company extended an offer to all holders of the series b stock to convert their shares into shares of common stock at a conversion price of  rather than the conversion price otherwise then in effect 
the market price of a share of the common stock during the term of the offer ranged from to 
holders of  shares of series b stock elected to convert their shares into  shares of common stock 
in addition  the company redeemed  shares of series b stock at per share 
after these transactions   shares of series b stock remain outstanding and the company has no further obligation to redeem any shares until april the company will be required to redeem  shares in april  and the remaining  shares in april the series b stock is convertible to common stock automatically if the common stock trades at a price in excess of of the then applicable conversion price for each day in a period of consecutive trading days 
the conversion price  as adjusted  is currently

year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  oil and gas sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  the increase was due to higher oil and gas production due to the company s successful drilling and recompletion program in oil production for the year ended december  increased to  barrels from  barrels for the year ended december  and gas production for the year ended december  increased to  mcf from  mcf for the year ended december  these increases were somewhat offset by a decline in average oil and gas prices realized in from those realized in average oil prices for the year ended december  decreased to per barrel from per barrel for the year ended december  and average gas prices for the year ended december  decreased to per mcf from per mcf for the year ended december  oil and gas production expenses 
oil and gas production expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating costs related to new wells drilled in and expansion and operation of the gas processing plant 
production tax and marketing expense per mcfe decreased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  lease operating expense per mcfe decreased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  loe per mcfe in is lower due to higher average production rates per well for new wells and a higher proportion of gas production in  which is less costly to produce than oil 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to increased oil and gas production 
depletion per mcfe for the year ended december  decreased slightly to from for the year ended december   due to a higher ratio of reserve increases to capital expenditures in due to the impairment of oil and gas properties charge in fourth quarter  discussed below  the depletion rate per mcfe is expected to decline in future periods 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
impairment of oil and gas properties was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  under the full cost accounting rules of the sec  the company reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis 
net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related tax effects 
application of these rules generally requires pricing future production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
the company made a non cash charge in fourth quarter to write down its us oil and gas properties by  in applying the ceiling test  the company used december  oil and gas prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
the full cost ceiling is not intended to represent an estimate of the fair market value of the company s oil and gas properties 
in light of continuing depressed prices for oil and natural gas  it is possible that the company may incur additional ceiling test write downs in the future 
the impairment amount of  in relates to additional charges that came in after the company impaired the costs incurred in related to an exploration venture in belize  which drilled a dry hole 
the company currently operates only in the continental united states

depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to increased oil and gas production 
depletion per mcfe for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher ratio of increases in oil and gas reserves to capital expenditures 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
impairment of oil and gas properties was  during the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  in fiscal  the company acquired a working interest in an exploration venture to drill one or more wells offshore belize

the company has used energy swaps and other financial arrangements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas 
gains and losses on such transactions are matched to product sales and charged or credited to oil and gas sales when that product is sold 
management believes that the use of various hedging arrangements can be a prudent means of protecting the company s financial interests from the volatility of oil and gas prices 
the company recognized hedging gains losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these gains losses are included in oil and gas sales in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the company terminated an energy swap entered into earlier in the year for production and received proceeds of  all of which is included in deferred revenue on the company s december  balance sheet 
year the following year statements constitute a year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of year issues result from the inability of certain electronic hardware and software to accurately calculate  store or use a date subsequent to december  these dates can be erroneously interpreted in a number of ways  eg  the year could be interpreted as the year this inability could result in a system failure or miscalculations that could in turn cause operational disruptions 
these issues could affect not only information technology it systems  such as computer systems used for accounting  land and engineering  but also systems that contain embedded chips 
the company has completed an assessment of its it systems to determine whether these systems are year compliant 
the company has determined that these systems are either compliant or with relatively minor modifications or upgrades many of which would have been made in any event as part of the company s continuing effort to enhance its it systems will be compliant 
all necessary modifications and upgrades and the testing thereof are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company is assessing its non information systems to ascertain whether these systems contain embedded computer chips that will not properly function subsequent to december  these systems include office equipment  the automatic wellhead equipment used to operate wells  the company owned gas gathering pipelines  and the company s gas processing plant in the san juan basin 
all of these systems have been determined to be year compliant based on information provided by third party vendors 
to date  the company has relied upon its internal staff to assess its year readiness 
the costs associated with assessing the company s year internal compliance and related systems modification  upgrading and testing are not currently expected to exceed  costs incurred through december  have been minimal 
the company is in the process of communicating with certain of its significant suppliers  service companies  gas gatherers and pipelines  electricity providers and financial institutions to determine the vulnerability of the company to third parties failure to address their year issues 
while the company has not yet received definitive responses indicating all such entities are year compliant  it has not received information suggesting the company is vulnerable to potential year failure by these parties 
these communications are expected to continue into the second quarter of at this time  the company has not developed any contingency plans to address third party non compliance with year matters 
however  should its communications with any third parties indicate significant vulnerability  development of contingency plans will be considered 
the company does not anticipate any significant disruptions of its operations due to year issues 
among the potential worst case problems the company could face would be the loss of electricity used to power well pumps and compressors that would result in wells being shut in  or the inability of a third party gas gathering company or pipeline to accept gas from the company s wells or gathering lines which would also result in the company s wells being shut in 
a disruption in production would result in the loss of income 
miscellaneous the company s oil and gas operations are significantly affected by certain provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  that are applicable to the oil and gas industry 
current law permits the company s intangible drilling and development costs to be deducted currently  or capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
the company  as an independent producer  is also entitled to a deduction for percentage depletion with respect to the first  bbls per day of domestic crude oil and or equivalent units of domestic natural gas produced if such percentage depletion exceeds cost depletion 
generally  this deduction is of gross income from an oil and gas property  without reference to the taxpayer s basis in the property 
the percentage depletion deduction may not exceed of the taxable income from a given property 
further  percentage depletion is limited in the aggregate to of the company s taxable income 
any depletion disallowed under the limitation  however  may be carried over indefinitely 
inflation has not historically had a material impact on the company s financial statements  and management does not believe that the company will be materially more or less sensitive to the effects of inflation than other companies in the oil and gas industry 
the company and its operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
a discussion of some of these risks is set forth  above  in items and  under the heading special considerations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company uses commodity derivative financial instruments  including swaps  to reduce the effect of natural gas price volatility on a portion of its natural gas production 
commodity swap agreements are generally used to fix a price at the natural gas market location or to fix a price differential between the price of natural gas at henry hub and the price of gas at its market location 
settlements are based on the difference between a fixed and a variable price as specified in the agreement 
the following table summarizes the company s derivative financial instrument position on its natural gas production as of december  the fair value of these instruments reflected below is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to settle the contracts as of december  actual settlement of these instruments when they mature will differ from these estimates reflected in the table 
gains or losses realized from these instruments hedging the company s production are expected to be offset by changes in the actual sales price received by the company for its natural gas production 
see hedging activities above 
year mmbtu fixed price per mmbtu fair value in addition  the company had an energy swap agreement in place at december   that counteracts the agreement included above with respect to  mmbtu of gas for under this swap agreement  the company must pay the counterparty if the fixed price of exceeds the floating price based on el paso natural gas san juan 
the fair value of this swap agreement was  at december  at december   the company also had two basis swaps in place to fix the differential between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is to be sold for  mmbtu in with a fair value of 
interest rate risk the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  expected maturity in thousands fair thereafter value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate       average interest rate interest rate swap variable to fixed      average pay rate average receive rate
