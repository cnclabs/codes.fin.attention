these agreements were settled via a cash payment of million in connection with the repayment of the zurn facility as discussed above 
to manage its interest rate exposure  the company entered into interest rate swaps to receive a floating rate based on three month libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate 
the fixed interest rates under the interest rate swaps currently outstanding range from to per annum 
net payments under the agreements amounted to approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the swaps are of notional amounts and maturities that relate to specific portions of outstanding debt  and accordingly  are accounted for as hedge transactions 
the aggregate notional amounts and periods covered by such agreements are as follows october  through september  million the company had issued standby letters of credit aggregating million at september  to protect the us dollar value of its anticipated profits denominated in foreign currencies  the company may purchase foreign currency put option contracts 
the contracts are purchased and settled in us dollars 
the company had no exposure with respect to these foreign currency options contracts other than the cost of such options 
the cost of such foreign currency options was not material 
there are no such options outstanding at september  the company has also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage expected cash flows at foreign operations 
such contracts have not been significant 
the interest rate protection agreements  foreign exchange options and foreign exchange forward contracts described above were the only derivative instruments held or entered into by the company at year end or during fiscal and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk exposures the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to limit the risks from such fluctuations  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to the company s policies and procedures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not engage in such transactions for trading purposes 
to manage exposure to interest rate movements the company uses interest rate protection agreements 
based on the company s overall exposure to interest rate changes  at september  and a hypothetical change of basis points across all maturities of the company s floating rate debt obligations  after considering interest rate protection agreements  would decrease the company s pre tax earnings by million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company utilizes foreign currency denominated borrowings to selectively hedge its net investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries 
such borrowings at september  and are denominated in german marks  british pounds  dutch guilders and hong kong dollars 
a change in the relevant currency exchange rates is estimated to have an impact on the fair value of such borrowings amounting to million at september  and million at september  this quantification of the company s exposure to the market risk of foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments is necessarily limited  as it does not take into account the offsetting impact of the company s underlying investment exposures 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its international operations as well as its us businesses  which import or export goods 
the company has made limited use of financial instruments to manage this risk 
foreign currency matters the functional currency of each of the company s foreign operations at september  is the local currency 
the operations in brazil operated in a hyperinflationary economy until on or about october   when brazil was no longer considered hyperinflationary 
during the hyperinflationary period  the functional currency of the company s operation in brazil was the us dollar 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  while revenue  expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
except for companies operating in hyperinflationary economies  translation gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the company s operations in brazil of million are included in other income expense  net  for fiscal effect of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in the company s principal markets  inflation did not have a material impact on its results of operations in fiscal  or year readiness disclosure many computer systems and other equipment with embedded technology use only two digits to define the applicable year and may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities and operations the year issue 
the company is actively addressing the year issue 
the compliance program is led by information technology staff at each operating company  with assistance from the finance and manufacturing staffs and outside technology consultants where necessary 
progress is being monitored by each operating company president and reported to usi management 
the company engaged outside technology consultants at various operating locations to provide independent reviews of year readiness and to augment the efforts of the local year teams or provide expertise in certain areas 
the company s year efforts focus on three areas information technology it related systems and processes  such as operating systems  applications and programs  embedded logic non it systems and processes  such as manufacturing machinery  telecommunications equipment and security devices  and compliance efforts of third parties such as customers  suppliers and service providers 
within each of the it and non it areas  the project spans four phases for both critical and non critical systems assessment of programs and devices to identify those that are affected by the year issue  development of remediation strategies  testing such strategies  and implementing the solutions 
critical systems are those systems both it and non it that would have a severe impact on the company s business and revenue if not made year ready 
the company evaluated each of its critical and principal customers  supplier  service providers and other business associates to determine each of such party s year readiness status 
these critical and principal third parties have either material system interfaces or other material relationships that an operating company is dependent upon 
the evaluation of each third party included a request for a year readiness certification 
then  depending upon each party s response  evaluation procedures were expanded to include obtaining year disclosures contained in sec filings of those third parties  where available  testing interfaced systems  holding face to face discussions with third parties  and developing and refining contingency plans to address the possibility of a third party failure to complete their year initiatives on a timely basis 
to date  of all third parties and of all critical and principal third parties queried for information relating to year compliance have responded  of which of all third parties and of critical and principal third parties indicated that they were not currently compliant 
each operating company has developed contingency plans to address those third parties that either indicated that they were not compliant  or who did not respond 
the company has completed an assessment of its critical it and non it systems and  as a result  the operating companies have decided to modify  upgrade or replace portions of their systems 
the development of these remediation strategies is complete 
all except for two of our operating companies  which generate less than of our sales  have tested and implemented solutions and are at least year compliant 
all of our operating companies are expected to complete the testing and implementation phases and be year compliant by december  year costs for computer equipment  software and outside consultants incurred through september  were approximately million  of which million was expensed and million was capitalized 
estimated future costs to complete the year program are million  of which million are expected to be expensed as incurred and the remaining million is expected to be capitalized 
these costs have been  and will continue to be  funded from operating cash flow and available credit facilities 
most of the costs are for new systems and improved functionality 
these costs include approximately million of internal payroll costs for employees who are involved in the year program 
the company has developed contingency plans to address the possibility of failure by the company or third parties to complete their year initiatives on a timely basis 
the company will continue to make further refinements to the contingency plans based on the company s ongoing evaluation of its readiness as well as the status of compliance by third parties 
such contingency plans include  among other procedures  using alternative processes  such as manual procedures to substitute for non compliant systems  arranging for alternate suppliers and service providers  increasing inventory levels  and developing procedures internally and in conjunction with significant third parties to address compliance issues as they arise 
no amount of preparation and testing can guarantee year compliance 
however  the company believes it is taking appropriate preventive measures and will be successful in avoiding any material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  the company recognizes that failing to resolve its year issues on a timely basis would  in a worst case scenario  significantly limit its ability to manufacture and distribute its products and process its daily business transactions for a period of time  especially if such failure is coupled with third party or infrastructure failures 
similarly  the ability to conduct operations without interruption after calendar may be significantly affected by the failure of one or more significant suppliers  customers or components of the infrastructure to conduct their respective operations without interruption after because of the difficulty of assessing the year compliance of such third parties  the company considers the potential disruptions caused by such parties to present the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
adverse effects on the company could include business disruption  increased costs  loss of sales and other similar ramifications 
the costs of the company s year initiatives  the dates on which the company believes that it will complete such activities and the company s evaluation of third party effects are estimates and subject to change 
actual results could differ from those currently anticipated 
factors that could cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of key year personnel  the company s ability to respond to unforeseen year complications  the readiness of third parties  the accuracy of third party assurances regarding year compliance and similar uncertainties
