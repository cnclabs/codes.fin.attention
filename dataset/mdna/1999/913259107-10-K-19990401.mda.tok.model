item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial highlights was a year of significant changes for the electric and gas utility operations of unitil corporation unitil or the company in the state of massachusetts 
changes in the massachusetts regulatory environment had a major impact on the company s financial position at december   and those regulatory changes have created a new definition of utility operations at unitil s massachusetts subsidiary  fitchburg gas and electric light company fg e  on a going forward basis 
as discussed below  several major events shaped our financial position and results of operations in electric utility industry restructuring was implemented in massachusetts with a rate reduction effective march  under fg e s restructuring plan the plan  which received final approval on january   fg e will complete the auction of its electric generation and power supply portfolio and will receive recovery of its stranded costs 
fg e also was granted its first gas base rate adjustment in years  an annual increase of approximately million or  effective december  even after the increase  the fg e s gas rates are among the lowest in massachusetts 
also  on november   gas utility industry bills were unbundled in massachusetts  and  based on an order issued by the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte on february   fg e expects to begin transitioning out of the gas merchant function for gas supply under a multi year phase in of a restructured natural gas industry in massachusetts 
finally  the early record setting weather conditions the warmest winter in at least years had a negative impact on the company s financial results  due to lower gas and electric sales in the first quarter of unitil receives final order on fg e s electric restructuring plan in massachusetts subsequent event on january   the mdte issued an order the order approving fg e s electric restructuring plan with certain modifications 
electric utility industry restructuring in massachusetts became effective on march   choice date 
on that date  fg e implemented open retail access  under its plan  and all of fg e s customers gained the right to choose their electricity supplier 
regardless of the supplier chosen  fg e will continue to deliver electricity to all of its customers within its distribution system  which remains a regulated business 
on choice date  fg e s customers received a rate discount 
since choice date  fg e has been authorized to earn a lower return on its generation related investments 
fg e is required to provide an additional discount upon the earlier of completion of its divestiture of generation investments or september  fg e has been allowed recovery of its restructuring transition costs  estimated at million  including its above market or stranded generation and power supply related costs  via a non bypassable uniform transition charge 
estimated regulatory assets  based upon the transition charges to be collected according to the plan  have been recorded together with the recognition of certain liabilities related to power supply contracts and generation assets 
the company s estimate  based on the competitive bidding process  of the above market portion of its power supply contract obligations is approximately million 
the net book value of its investment in other generation assets  principally investments in joint owned generation facilities  is approximately million 
also  as a result of the competitive bidding process  fg e expects to receive approximately million in proceeds from the disposition of its investment in a joint owned generation facility 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the adjustments above  are reflected in the company s balance sheet 
earnings and dividends net income for was million  slightly above earnings 
lower interest expense  lower operating expenses  and a lower effective income tax rate contributed positively to the company s earnings performance 
sales revenues in were comparable to  as system growth was offset by a mild winter heating season 
basic earnings per average common share were for the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
the decrease in from  on a per share basis  is attributable to higher common shares outstanding in which were issued through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans see capital requirements and liquidity and note 
diluted earnings per share were  and for  and  respectively 
the average return on common equity was   and in   and  respectively 
unitil s common stock dividends in were per share  an increase of over s annual dividend of per share 
this annual dividend of in resulted in a payout ratio of 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate by an additional  resulting in the current effective annualized dividend of per share 
operating revenues electric unit kwh sales unitil s total electric kilowatt hour sales increased by in compared to  primarily due to system growth and increased activity of a major industrial customer  offset by the milder winter weather in early the winter heating season was warmer than normal and warmer than the same period in sales to residential customers increased by in compared to  and were higher than sales 
these energy sales increases are due to the expansion of our residential customer base within our service territories and overall healthy regional economic conditions 
commercial and industrial sales of electricity in were boosted by the resumption of operations of a major industrial customer which had been curtailed through the first quarter of electric energy sales to all commercial and industrial customers were up in  due to a strong economy and the fact that the major customer mentioned above had curtailed operations for all of sales are lower by compared to  as the major customer mentioned above was in full operation for most of the following table details total kilowatt hour sales for the last three years by major customer class kwh sales s residential    commercial    industrial    total kwh sales    electric utility rates before and after industry restructuring in massachusetts show the significant change in the way the company s combined electric and gas utility  fg e  provides electric utility service to its customers 
prior to march   fg e provided all of its customers with bundled electric service that reflected its obligation to provide energy supply and the delivery of that energy to and across its system 
after march   fg e unbundled its prices for energy supply  transmission and distribution or delivery services  and for the first time allowed customers to choose an alternative energy supplier from the competitive market 
fg e will continue to provide for the delivery of all energy supply across its system 
customers monthly bills  after march  reflect these unbundled prices and individually display energy supply  transition charges  delivery  and other related services 
as part of the transition to the new market structure  fg e will offer standard offer service sos to its customers who elect not to choose a competitive energy supplier  for up to years 
fg e has contracted with an energy supplier to provide sos to its customers at no profit to fg e 
one of the purposes of this service is to give customers a power supply price from which they can measure competitive offers before they are ready to enter the competitive market 
two other important features of fg e s unbundled rates are the transition charge component of the bill  which is designed to recover fg e s transition costs resulting from restructuring over approximately years  and the provision of a total rate discount of 
fg e will provide an additional discount upon the earlier of completion of its divestiture of generation investments or september  electric operating revenue decreased by million  or  in compared to the impact of higher sales volume across all customer classes was offset by lower electric rates  due to the discount mandated in massachusetts  and overall lower energy supply prices 
energy supply costs are normally collected from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms 
changes in energy supply prices do not affect net income  as they normally mirror corresponding changes in energy supply costs 
electric operating revenue s residential    commercial    industrial    total operating revenue    operating revenues gas unit therm sales total firm therm gas sales decreased in when compared to the decrease in sales is primarily attributable to the mild winter heating season  which was the warmest in the years such data has been kept 
sales to residential and commercial customers  which are most sensitive to weather  decreased by and  respectively  while sales to industrial customers were up by 
total firm therm sales decreased in the two year period from to  as the winter heating season in was significantly colder than in the following table details total firm therm gas sales for the last three years by major customer class firm therm gas sales s residential    commercial    industrial    total therm sales    gas operating revenues  which represent approximately of unitil s total operating revenues  decreased by million  or  in compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in firm therm gas sales related to weather  as discussed above 
in december  fg e concluded its gas base rate case  which resulted in a rate increase of approximately 
concurrent with the rate increase  fg e unbundled its gas bills  showing a separate itemization of all delivery service charges  as well as supplier service charges 
this will allow customers to compare their current gas supply rates against offers they receive from competitive suppliers  once competition begins in see regulatory matters 
gas operating revenue s residential    commercial    industrial    total operating revenue    operating revenues other other revenue declined from  in to  in the decrease in other revenue from  in is the result of the termination of an administrative services agreement between unitil resources  inc and a principal customer 
operating expenses fuel and purchased power expense is the cost of power supply  including fuel used in electric generation and the price of wholesale energy and capacity  that meets the unitil s electric energy requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses normally recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms decreased million  or in compared to the change reflects a decrease in wholesale power prices offset by an increase in the company s total energy requirements in the combined power supply portfolio of the unitil is comprised of a variety of resources 
for  the portfolio was comprised of owned generation  purchased power from utilities  and purchased power from non utility generators 
the company anticipates that power supply related costs and corresponding revenues will decline in future years  as customers choose alternate competitive energy suppliers under a restructured electric utility industry 
gas purchased for resale reflects gas purchased and manufactured to supply the company s total gas energy requirements 
gas supply costs are recoverable from customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
purchased gas costs decreased by approximately million or in as compared to  reflecting a decrease in therms purchased in and lower wholesale gas prices in gas purchased for resale decreased by million  or in the two year period from to  based on lower wholesale prices and a decrease in therms purchased due to warmer weather 
under order  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has allowed gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently incurred costs resulting from the transition into a deregulated environment 
fg e has been incurring ferc approved transition charges from its natural gas pipeline supplier since through the end of  the amount of transition costs incurred by the company totaled approximately million 
these costs are being recovered directly from gas customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
the company does not expect to incur any additional transition costs in operation and maintenance expense  which includes utility operating costs  conservation and load management program expenditures and the company s share of operating costs related to power production at the generation facilities in which the company has a partial ownership interest  increased by approximately million  or in compared to the increase in operation and maintenance expenses compared to last year reflects higher administrative costs associated with filing and implementation of fg e s restructuring plan and energy supply divestiture efforts 
these additional expenses related to industry restructuring in massachusetts are partially offset by revenues accrued to be recovered  in the future  upon divestiture of the energy supply portfolio  or through other rate cost reconciliation mechanisms 
in  operation and maintenance expense decreased from by approximately million  or  due to lower distribution operating expenses partially offset by the higher costs of power production 
depreciation  amortization and taxes depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  for over the prior year due to the accelerated write off of electric generating assets  in accordance with fg e s restructuring plan 
federal and state income taxes decreased in compared to by million 
this result reflects lower net income before taxes  as well as higher amortization of flow through investment tax credits in local property and other taxes increased million  or  in this increase mainly reflects higher payroll taxes slightly offset by lower local property taxes 
local property and other taxes increased in  compared to  by 
non operating income expenses non operating expenses income in were relatively unchanged from  as there was a continuation of community service programs throughout the unitil  s service territory 
in  non operating income of million reflects the one time gain on the sale of the company s former corporate headquarters 
interest expense interest expense  net decreased million or in from  primarily reflecting an increase in accrued interest income associated with deferred rate recovery mechanisms and interest on refunds received from suppliers 
interest expense remained flat  as increased borrowing levels were offset by lower interest rates 
the increase in interest expense for over was a result of higher interest rates and the construction financing of the company s new corporate headquarters 
capital requirements and liquidity unitil requires capital for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain and expand its electric and gas distribution systems  and to improve customer service operations and capabilities 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from the company s retained earnings and through the sale of shares of common stock through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
when internally generated funds are not available  it is the company s policy to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and  when necessary  to repay short term debt through the issuance of permanent financing 
cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in  after increasing by million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to higher working capital needs at the year end balance sheet date  as a result of timing differences of payments on energy supply contracts  as well as increased refunds of customer deposits 
in compared to  million of the increase in operating cash flow was the result of a decrease in the timing difference undercollection between the payment on fuel  purchased power and purchased gas costs  and the corresponding recovery of these costs in revenue billed under periodic cost recovery mechanisms 
the balance of the increase reflects other changes in the company s working capital requirements as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
operating activities s cash provided by operating activities    cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million in reflecting higher planned spending for utility customer and distribution system additions and improvements 
the decrease of million in compared to  reflected spending  in  for the construction of the company s new corporate headquarters 
the company also received cash payments of million from the state of new hampshire in  related to the eminent domain taking of is former corporate headquarters for a highway expansion project 
investing activities s cash used in investing activities    cash flows from financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase reflects higher net borrowings of million and increased common stock issued of million  net of other items 
on september   concord electric company ceco sold  of year series j first mortgage bonds at par to an institutional investor  bearing an interest rate of 
proceeds were used to repay short term indebtedness  incurred to fund ceco s ongoing construction program  and to redeem a higher coupon long term debt issue prior to its maturity 
the redemption of  was on the series h first mortgage bonds 
on september   exeter hampton electric company e h sold  of year series l first mortgage bonds at par to an institutional investor  bearing an interest rate of 
proceeds were used to repay short term indebtedness  incurred to fund e h s ongoing construction program  and to redeem two higher coupon long term debt issues prior to their maturity 
the redemptions  which totaled  included  of series h first mortgage bonds  and  of series j first mortgage bonds 
additional short term borrowings were incurred  primarily to fund costs related to electric industry restructuring in massachusetts that will be collected in future periods 
during  the company raised million of additional common equity capital through the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
the company raised million of additional common equity capital in and million of additional equity capital in  through the issuance of  and  shares  respectively of common stock in connection with these plans 
the company also raised   and  of additional common equity capital in   and  respectively  through the issuance of shares  as a result of the exercise of options granted under the company s key employee stock option plan kesop 
the total number of shares issued under the kesop plan in  and were  shares   shares and  shares  respectively 
the change from to reflects a decrease in borrowings  due to the repayment of short term debt 
higher short term borrowings in were primarily due to funding of the timing difference undercollection between payments on fuel  purchased power and purchased gas costs and the corresponding recovery of these costs in revenue billed under periodic cost recovery mechanisms  as well as the construction financing of the company s new corporate headquarters 
financing activities s cash from financing activities    subsequent event fg e financing on january   fg e sold  of long term notes at par to institutional investors  bearing an interest rate of 
proceeds were used to repay short term indebtedness  incurred to fund fg e s ongoing construction programs 
regulatory matters restructuring and competition regulatory activity surrounding restructuring and competition continues in both massachusetts and new hampshire 
march  was choice date or the beginning of competition for all electric consumers in massachusetts  while new hampshire s choice date slipped past both the proposed date of january   and the legislature s mandated july  currently  approximately of new hampshire electric consumers can choose their electric supplier 
the ability to choose for the remaining is currently the subject of a federal court preliminary injunction see below 
massachusetts gas industry restructuring plans continue to be under development 
the mdte  gas utilities and other stakeholders began a collaborative effort in late to develop solutions to the many issues that surround restructuring the local natural gas distribution business 
unitil has been preparing for electric and gas industry restructuring by developing transition plans that will move its utility subsidiaries into this new market structure in a way that will ensure fairness in the treatment of the company s assets and obligations that are dedicated to the current regulated franchises and  at the same time  provide choice for all customers 
massachusetts electric on january   the mdte gave final approval to fg e s restructuring plan with certain modifications 
the plan provides customers with a a choice of energy supplier  b an option to purchase standard offer service ie state mandated energy service provided by fg e at regulated rates for up to seven years  and c a cumulative rate reduction 
the plan also provides for fg e to divest generation assets and its portfolio of purchased power contracts 
the company will be afforded full recovery of any transition costs through a non bypassable retail transition charge 
pursuant to the plan  on october   the company filed with the mdte a proposed contract with constellation power services inc for provision of standard offer service 
the mdte s january  order approves the fg e constellation contract  and service thereunder is scheduled to commence on march   and is scheduled to continue through february  this contract is the result of the first successful standard offer auction conducted in massachusetts 
the january order also approved the company s power supply divestiture plan for its interest in three generating units and four long term power supply contracts 
a contract for the sale of fg e s interest in the new haven harbor plant was filed with the mdte on november  the mdte s decision is pending 
contracts for the sale of the company s remaining generating assets and purchased power contracts are expected to be filed with the mdte in the near future 
all such contracts are subject to mdte approval 
massachusetts gas in mid  the mdte directed all massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies ldcs to form a collaborative with other stakeholders to develop common principles and appropriate regulations for the unbundling of gas service  and directed fg e and four other ldcs to file unbundled gas rates for its review 
fg e s unbundled gas rates were approved by the mdte and implemented in november of on july  the mdte established april  as the date by which unbundled gas service would begin to be implemented by all ldcs 
on february   the mdte issued an order in which it determined that the ldcs would continue to have an obligation to provide gas supply and delivery services for another five years  with a review after three years 
that order also set forth the mdte s decision regarding release by ldcs of their pipeline capacity contracts to competitive marketers 
in january of  the ldcs reported to the mdte that they were continuing to work to develop systems and practices to implement unbundling 
the mdte has not yet responded to the ldcs report  and it appears unlikely that full implementation will be achieved by the april  target date 
new hampshire on february   the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc issued its final plan for transition to a competitive electric market in new hampshire 
the order allowed ceco and e h  unitil s new hampshire retail distribution utilities  to recover of stranded costs for a two year period  but excluded recovery of certain administrative related charges 
northeast utilities affiliate  public service company of new hampshire  appealed the nhpuc order in federal district court 
a temporary restraining order was issued on march  in june  unitil was admitted as a plaintiff intervenor in the federal court proceeding 
on june   the federal court issued an injunction continuing the freeze on nhpuc efforts to implement restructuring 
several parties have filed interlocutory appeals  and no date has been scheduled for a trial in the federal court 
the company will vigorously pursue its action in the federal court and simultaneously look for ways to resolve issues and bring forth choice to its retail customers 
in september of  the company reached a comprehensive restructuring settlement with key parties and filed this voluntary agreement with the nhpuc 
the agreement was modified on october  in oral deliberations on november and november   the nhpuc imposed conditions to approval of the settlement which were unacceptable to the company  and the settlement was subsequently withdrawn 
the component of the agreement dealing with wholesale rates was filed with the ferc in september  and approved by the ferc in early november 
however  implementation will not occur  as the changes were conditioned upon approval by the nhpuc 
unitil continues to participate actively in all proceedings and in several nhpuc established working groups which will define details of the transition to competition and customer choice 
rate cases the last formal regulatory hearings to increase base electric rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for concord electric company  for fitchburg gas and electric light company and for exeter hampton electric company 
on may   fg e filed a gas base rate case with the mdte 
after evidentiary hearings  the mdte issued an order allowing fg e to establish new rates  effective november   that would produce an annual increase of approximately million in gas revenues 
however  as part of the proceeding  the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts alleged that fg e had double collected fuel inventory finance charges  since  and requested that the mdte require fg e to refund approximately million to its customers 
the company believes that the attorney general s claim is without merit and that a refund is not justified or warranted 
the mdte stated its intent to open a separate proceeding to investigate the attorney general s claim 
a majority of the company s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas and energy efficiency program cost recovery mechanisms 
restructuring will continue to change the methods of how certain costs are recovered from customers and from suppliers 
transition costs  standard offer service and default service power supply costs  internal and external transmission service costs and energy efficiency and renewable energy program costs for fg e are being recovered via fully reconciling rate adjustment mechanisms in massachusetts 
millstone unit no 
fg e has a nonoperating ownership in the millstone unit no 
millstone nuclear generating unit which supplies it with megawatts mw of electric capacity 
in january  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc placed millstone on its watch list  which calls for increased nrc inspection attention 
on march   as a result of an engineering evaluation completed by the operator  northeast utilities  millstone was taken out of service 
nrc authorization for restart was given on june  millstone began producing electric power in early july  and reached full output on july  the unit remains on the nrc s watch list 
during the period that millstone was out of service  fg e continued to incur its proportionate share of the unit s ongoing operations and maintenance o m costs  and may incur additional o m costs and capital expenditures to meet nrc requirements 
fg e also incurred costs to replace the power that was expected to be generated by the unit 
during the outage  fg e had been incurring approximately  per month in replacement power costs  and had been recovering those costs through its fuel adjustment clause  which will be subject to review and approval by the mdte 
in august  fg e  in concert with other non operating joint owners  filed a demand for arbitration in connecticut and a lawsuit in massachusetts  in an effort to recover costs associated with the extended unplanned shutdown 
the arbitration and legal cases are proceeding 
environmental matters in september  the fg e signed a memorandum of understanding with the massachusetts highway department and the massachusetts department of environmental protection that accommodates the construction of a new highway bridge across sawyer passway  the company s former manufactured gas plant mgp site 
this memorandum satisfies the requirements of the massachusetts contingency plan for temporary closure at this last remaining portion of the site 
specifically  this agreement allows for current fg e efforts to perform remediation work required as result of bridge construction 
upon completion of site remediation associated with the bridge construction  this last remaining portion of the sawyer passway mgp site is expected to be closed out and attain the status of temporary closure in late this temporary closure allows fg e to monitor the site every five years to determine if a more feasible remediation alternative can be developed and achieved 
the costs of remedial action at this site are initially funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the mdte 
the company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of fuel and gas costs in rates 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
as the utility industry deregulates  the company will be divesting its commodity related energy businesses and therefore will be further reducing its exposure to commodity related risk 
year software compliance discussion the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations are not adversely affected by software or device failures related to the year date recognition problem  the yk issues 
specifically  yk issues would arise when software applications  or devices with embedded chips  fail to correctly recognize and process the year and beyond 
certain software applications and devices are certified to recognize and process date references to the year and beyond and they are deemed to be year compliant  year compliance 
potential software failures could create incorrect calculations  among other errors  and they present a risk to the integrity of our company s financial systems and the reliability of our operating systems 
in order to minimize the risk of disruption to our business operations  the company is taking the actions described below  including communicating with suppliers  dealers  financial institutions and others with which it does business  to coordinate the identification  evaluation  remediation and testing of possible yk issues which may affect the company the company has established a centralized task force to identify and implement necessary changes to the company s internal computer systems  controlling hardware devices and software applications in order to achieve year compliance for those systems 
the remediation of yk issues and testing of all critical components of the company s internal systems is scheduled to be completed by june  the company has also established processes for evaluating and managing the risks and possible costs associated with yk issues which may exist in systems external to the company s operations  but could affect the company s operations indirectly 
the company has already directed efforts to notify our critical vendors and suppliers about yk issues which may affect our operations  and most are already providing important information about the year readiness of their organizations 
testing of certain critical systems has already begun  in conjunction with our key suppliers and vendors  and the company is planning to develop contingency plans in circumstances where assurance of year compliance cannot be obtained 
the company currently estimates it will invest in the range of  to  plus internal costs  over the cost of normal software upgrades and replacements to achieve year compliance 
these additional capital outlays include costs to replace certain devices and software  and the costs for consultants to assist us with software programming and testing 
unitil relies on the proper operation of a regional network of systems and devices to transport and distribute electricity and gas to its customers 
any disruption in those systems caused by yk issues could interrupt the reliable delivery of electric and gas service through our distribution operating companies 
some of these software systems and devices belong to other companies and are beyond the control of unitil to ensure that they are properly remediated for year however  several agencies  including the department of energy  the new england iso  and the national electricity reliability council  have active year programs in place 
these programs will ensure that member companies are actively and comprehensively dealing with any year issues in their supply  generation  transportation and distribution facilities and systems 
unitil participates in these groups and currently believes that satisfactory progress is being made and will continue to be made to ensure a reliable supply and delivery of energy 
furthermore  these groups plan to establish contingency plans to cover delivery difficulties during key year dates 
the company also plans to work with local  state and regional agencies and other utility companies to ensure that appropriate contingency plans are in place for energy supply and delivery systems which could be affected by year difficulties 
in addition  while the company currently anticipates that its own mission critical systems will be year compliant in a timely fashion  it cannot guarantee the compliance of other systems operated by other companies upon which it depends 
for example  the company s ability to provide electricity to its customers depends upon the regional electric transmission grid which connects the systems of neighboring utilities to provide electric power for the region 
if one company s system is not year compliant  then a failure could impact all providers within the grid  including unitil 
similarly  the company s gas operations depend upon natural gas pipelines that it does not own or control  and any year noncompliance associated with these pipelines may affect the company s ability to provide natural gas to its customers 
failure to achieve year readiness could have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows
