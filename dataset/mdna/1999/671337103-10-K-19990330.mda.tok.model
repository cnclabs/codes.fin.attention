the decline in the percentage of the allowance to total loans at december   generally reflects the fact that one half of the company s loan growth was comprised of residential real estate 
this loan type requires the lowest percentage reserve requirement in the company s portfolio due to the negligible loan losses in this category over the last five years

changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances volume change or changes in average rates rate change for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
volume change is calculated as change in volume times the old rate  while rate change is the change in rate times the old volume 
the table on page indicates the dollar amount of the change attributable to each factor

effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  servicing rights  and extinguishment of liabilities  that provides accounting guidance on transfers of financial assets  servicing of financial assets  and extinguishment of liabilities 
sfas no 
introduces an approach to accounting for transfers of financial assets that provides a means of dealing with more complex transactions in which the seller disposes of only a partial interest in the assets  retains rights or obligations  makes use of special purpose entities in the transaction  or otherwise has continuing involvement with the transferred assets 
the new accounting method  referred to as the financial components approach  provides that the carrying amount of the financial assets transferred be allocated to components of the transaction based on their relative fair values 
sfas no 
provides criteria for determining whether control of assets has been relinquished and whether a sale has occurred 
if the transfer does not qualify as a sale  it is accounted for as a secured borrowing 
transactions subject to the provisions of sfas no 
include among others  transfers involving repurchase agreements  securitizations of financial assets  loan participations  factoring arrangements and transfers of receivables with recourse 
an entity that undertakes an obligation to service financial assets recognizes either a servicing asset or liability for the servicing contract unless related to a securitization of assets  and all the securitized assets are retained and classified as held to maturity 
a servicing asset or liability that is purchased or assumed is initially recognized at its fair value 
servicing assets and liabilities are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and are subject to subsequent assessments for impairment based on fair value 
sfas no 
provides that a liability is removed from the balance sheet only if the debtor either pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or is legally released from being the primary obligor 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after december   and is to be applied prospectively 
earlier or retroactive application is not permitted 
management adopted sfas no 
effective january   as required  without material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
it does not require a specific format for that financial statement but requires that an enterprise display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in that financial statement 
sfas no 
requires that an enterprise a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes in required 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
significantly changes the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about reportable segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas no 
uses a management approach to disclose financial and descriptive information about the way that management organizes the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
for many enterprises  the management approach will likely result in more segments being reported 
in addition  sfas no 
requires significantly more information to be disclosed for each reportable segment than is presently being reported in annual financial statements and also requires that selected information be reported in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires entities to recognize all derivatives in their financial statements as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
sfas no 
also specifies new methods of accounting for hedging activities  prescribes the items and transactions that may be hedged  and specifies detailed criteria to be met to qualify for hedging accounting 
the definition of a derivative financial instrument is complex  but in general  it is an instrument with one or more underlyings  such as an interest rate or foreign exchange rate  that is applied to a notional amount  such as an amount of currency  to determine the settlement amount s 
it generally requires no significant initial investment and can be settled net or by delivery of an asset that is readily convertible to cash 
sfas no 
applies to derivatives embedded in other contracts  unless the underlying of the embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the host contract 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  on adoption  entities are permitted to transfer held to maturity debt securities to an available for sale or trading category without calling into question their intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require measurement of financial condition and results of operations in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
since the primary assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature  changes in the general level of prices for goods and services have a relatively minor impact on the company s total expenses 
increases in operating expenses such as salaries and maintenance are in part attributable to inflation 
however  interest rates have a far more significant effect than inflation on the performance of financial institutions  including the company 
other matters year issues as with all providers of financial services  the company s operations are heavily dependent on information technology systems 
the bank and action are addressing the potential problems associated with the possibility that the computers that control or operate their information technology system and infrastructure may not be programmed to read four digit dates codes and upon arrival of the year  may recognize the two digit code as the year  causing systems to fail to function or to generate erroneous data 
the bank and action are working with the companies that supply or service its information technology systems to identify and remedy any year related problems 
in  the company developed a three phase program within the guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council the ffiec 
phase i awareness and assessment was to define the problem  to establish a committee to oversee the project  to develop an overall strategy  to identify all aspects that could be affected by the year  to recognize vendor responsibilities  and to formulate contingency plans 
phase ii renovation is to upgrade and replace equipment as necessary 
phase i and phase ii were largely completed by december  during the phases  the following systems were considered to be mission critical peerless software  isbo link  and fedline 
peerless is the bank s main processing system  while the isbo link is the bank s connection with the independent state bank of ohio 
the isbo link processes wires  credit card applications  and fed funds 
fedline is the bank s connection with the federal reserve bank 
wires  automated clearing house ach  treasury tax and loan  and payer services are mission critical applications processed on the fedline 
the company is in the process of upgrading these systems as necessary 
however  should any of these mission critical systems fail to be year ready  contingency plans to warehouse transactions  to correspond with isbo and the federal reserve via telephone and fax  and to manually process payer services and ach are in place and to be used until such time that the year errors can be corrected 
phase iii validation began during the fourth quarter of and is scheduled to be completed by early in this phase  systems and equipment will be tested to ensure year readiness 
the company believes that to ensure year readiness  approximately  in costs will be incurred 
approximately of the costs were incurred during  while the remaining amount is expected to be incurred during although the company believes that this estimate is reasonable at this time  if the bank and or action is ultimately required to purchase replacement computer systems  programs and or equipment  or incur substantial expense to make their systems  programs  and or equipment year ready  the company s net earnings and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition to possible expense related to its own systems  the bank and or action could incur losses if loan payments are delayed due to year problems affecting any major borrowers in their primary market areas 
because their loan portfolios are highly diversified with regard to individual borrowers and types of businesses  and their primary market areas are not significantly dependent upon any one employer or industry  they do not expect any significant or prolonged difficulties that will affect net earnings or cash flow
