item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview comptek designs and develops specialized systems  software  and proprietary products intended for the global military electronics market 
these defense related systems provide management information and implement offensive and defensive responses in combat situations 
additionally  we are a supplier of ew simulation stimulation  training and software validation systems related to electronic surveillance 
we also develop systems and provide engineering and technical services for the maintenance and upgrade of ew and command  control  communication  computers and intelligence ci systems for several us air force and us navy platforms 
our systems and services are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  cost reimbursement  and time and materials 
fixed price contracts require us to provide products and perform services at a stipulated price 
under cost reimbursement contracts  we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract  to the extent that such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit 
time and materials contracts reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials incurred 
comptek assumes greater financial risk on fixed price contracts than on either cost reimbursement or time and materials contracts 
however  fixed price contracts typically provide us with greater profit opportunities due to our ability to control costs in such contracts 
during fiscal we completed two acquisitions 
the acquisition of prb associates  inc prb was in may as a result  prb contributed eleven months of operations  significantly affecting our consolidated financial results 
the second transaction occurred in march  when we acquired the business operations  assets and related liabilities of amherst systems  inc amherst 
prb is a leader in the development of military mission planning systems used to automate complex planning functions for routing  fuel  ordnance and tactics for advanced aircraft weapons systems 
prb operates primarily under the tactical systems segment typically under cost reimbursement contracts 
amherst is a manufacturer of computer controlled simulation stimulation equipment and systems that are used to test military avionics equipment including radar warning receivers  radar counter measures equipment  radar  and infrared sensor systems 
amherst s annualized net sales  prior to the acquisition  were approximately million  with the majority of such sales attributable to domestic activities under fixed price contracts 
the pro forma financial information pertaining to the amherst and prb acquisitions is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these acquisitions  we have revised our reportable business segments in view of our expected increase in simulation stimulation and training systems sales 
the new segments are ew simulation stimulation and training systems simulation and training  tactical systems  and engineering and technical services services 
the simulation and training and tactical systems segments operate primarily under fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts 
the services segment primarily performs under time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
previously  we reported our operating activities in two defense related segments defense systems systems and engineering and technical services services 
the systems segment included operating activities for tactical systems  as well as simulation stimulation and training systems 
our historical segment data has been restated to reflect these new designations and to reflect the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
segment information is in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the department of defense dod  our principal customer  which accounted for approximately of sales in both fiscal years and  and of sales in fiscal year  has reduced overall spending in real dollars 
we expect future dod spending for military electronics to increase as major systems are upgraded or replaced 
in this dod spending environment  competition for new procurements is intense and industry consolidation by mergers and acquisitions is commonplace 
contract backlog at march   was million 
since march   backlog has increased primarily due to the addition of the backlog of prb in may and amherst in march additionally  the backlog increase is the result of an award in july for million for the upgrade of the ew system for the ea b strike support aircraft 
results of operations selected financial data 
the following table sets forth certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total net sales for the periods indicated for the year ended march net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit interest expense net income fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
the tactical systems segment s net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the acquisition of prb in may accounted for million of this increase 
the majority of prb sales are attributable to domestic activities with the dod 
the simulation and training segment s net sales were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is attributable to work performed under two international simulation contracts totaling approximately million 
these contracts were awarded at the close of fiscal and are due to be delivered during fiscal and fiscal the acquired operations of amherst are expected to significantly increase the net sales of the simulation and training segment for the fiscal year ended march  the services segment reported fiscal net sales of million  compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of 
this decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in subcontractor work on our electronic combat mission support ecms contract with the us navy 
the us navy continues to contract a large portion of the subcontractor work on this contract directly with subcontractors  as opposed to passing this work through comptek s ecms contract as was the case in previous years 
sales on the ecms contract decreased to million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in the fiscal year ended march  the ecms contract had a period of performance through august   and was extended by the us navy in august for an additional two years with a potential value of up to million 
because our role in managing work essentially performed by subcontractors under ecms is limited in scope  the profit margin we realize on such sales is relatively low 
accordingly  substantial decreases in sales volume have little impact on profits 
sales made directly to foreign prime contractors and governments were million or of total sales in the fiscal year ended march   compared with million or in the fiscal year ended march  the company s international sales typically occur with product lines from the simulation and training segment under fixed price contracts 
indirect international sales  via the us foreign military sales program  represented million or of total sales in fiscal  compared with million or in fiscal the percentage of net sales attributable to foreign requirements decreased in fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of prb which contributed of net sales for the period while only contributing million  or  in foreign sales 
this percentage is expected to decrease in fiscal due to the acquisition of amherst 
historically  of amherst s net sales represents total international sales 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
gross margin percentage increased in the fiscal year ended march  to  from in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the prb acquisition and the increased systems sales in both the tactical systems and simulation and training segments  the company s systems sales as a percentage of total company sales increased in fiscal systems sales typically produce higher than average gross margins for the company 
additionally  the overall gross margin percentage improved as a result of the completion of a multi year contract in fiscal  in the services segment  at a higher profit percentage than previously anticipated 
the reduction in services ecms net sales had a minimal impact on gross margin due to its pass through type nature 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
the acquisition of prb has resulted in the overall increase in sg a expenditures for fiscal while the tactical systems segment sales produced higher gross margins  this systems based work generally requires a higher level of expenditures in marketing and bidding efforts to win new contracts 
also  the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles arising from the prb acquisition increased sg a expenses 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from  in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
r d efforts in both periods were directed primarily at enhancing and maintaining existing products and systems 
r d efforts are concentrated mainly in the tactical systems and the simulation and training segments 
the addition of the prb operations in may added approximately million in r d expenditures for fiscal in prior years  the majority of operations were services based  which typically resulted in relatively low amounts of r d investments 
we anticipate a continued growth in the systems based business 
as a result  r d expenditures in total dollars  and as a percentage of sales  are likely to increase 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from  in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
this increase is attributable to the financing costs relating to the acquisition of prb 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
we reported an overall effective tax rate of in the fiscal year ended march  compared with in the fiscal year ended march  this slight increase is the net result of the non deductible goodwill created as a result of the prb acquisition offset  in part  by an increase in sales in our foreign sales corporation fsc 
the fsc allows a portion of the income generated by international sales to be exempt from federal income taxes 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in the fiscal year ended march  from million  or per diluted share  in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing a decrease of 
the tactical systems segment s net sales increased to million in  from million in  an increase of 
increases were realized on various systems development engineering subcontracts for the us navy and us air force 
the simulation and training segment reported net sales of million  compared with net sales of million  an increase of 
in the fiscal year ended march   we experienced increased sales under a fixed price contract with the us air force for an air combat measurement instrumentation system 
the services segment reported net sales of million  compared with million in  a decrease of approximately 
this decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in lower margin subcontractor work on our ecms contract with the us navy 
sales on the ecms contract decreased to million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in the fiscal year ended march  our contract with naval sea systems command navsea  also included in the services segment  accounted for million and million of net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
in may  we were awarded a successor contract to continue to provide engineering services for navsea 
this one year contract award included four additional one year options exercisable by the us navy 
total direct international sales increased to in the fiscal year ended march   compared with in the fiscal year ended march  gross margin 
gross margin increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
gross margin percentage increased in the fiscal year ended march  to  from in the fiscal year ended march  our overall sales mix favorably affected the current year gross margin percentage 
the services segment s sales decreased by  resulting in a reduction in gross margin dollars 
this sales decrease was primarily due to the lower margin subcontractor work  as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
during  we continued to focus on marketing and bidding efforts in both foreign and domestic markets 
this emphasis resulted in an increase in sg a expense  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a increased to in the fiscal year ended march  from in the fiscal year ended march  research and development expenses 
r d expenses decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march  from  in the fiscal year ended march   representing a decrease of 
r d efforts in both periods were directed primarily at enhancing and maintaining existing products and systems 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march  from  in the fiscal year ended march   representing a decrease of 
this decrease is the result of the reduction in the long term debt balance throughout the fiscal year 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
we reported an overall effective tax rate of in the fiscal year ended march   compared with in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in our effective rate is associated with the establishment of a fsc 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in the fiscal year ended march  from million  or per diluted share  in the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents summary cash flow information for the years indicated year ended march in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing 
activities net cash provided by used in financing activities total change 

in cash the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily driven by the increase in net income 
operations provided working capital  net of the effects of acquisitions  of  in and  in investing activities required total cash of million used for the acquisition of prb in may and amherst in march additionally  cash was used to purchase capital equipment of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and further software development of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of prb for a purchase price of million was financed with borrowings under the senior credit facility and notes payable to the sellers 
total payments for the acquisition  net of cash received  were million 
the acquisition of the operations  assets and associated liabilities of amherst for a purchase price of million was financed through the placement of million convertible subordinated debentures  borrowings under the senior credit facility  and notes payable to the seller 
total cash payments for the amherst acquisition  net of cash received  were million 
on march   in connection with the acquisition of amherst  the senior credit facility was restructured and a new facility was established 
this new facility is further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt  debentures  and the revolving credit facility were utilized to finance the acquisitions of prb and amherst in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our total long term debt by million  compared with a reduction of million in fiscal cash generated from the sale of treasury shares to our employees through the employee stock purchase plan was used to repurchase   and  shares of the company s common stock for the treasury in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of the additional debt incurred from the acquisitions  total debt to equity ratio increased to to at march  from to at march  at march   total debt to equity ratio was to in march  as a result of the amherst acquisition  we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with an available capacity of million 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to cover current requirements of working capital  capital expenditures demand  stock repurchases  and the repayment of long term debt 
other activities the company holds  shares of aria wireless systems  inc aria common stock 
as of march   the common shares of aria were quoted on the otc bulletin board at a last trade price of per share 
there can be no assurances that the company could achieve such a price upon any sale of its aria shares 
due to the limited amount of available financial and market information  the company s equity interest in aria has not been given any accounting value in the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation continues to have minimal affect upon our results 
where competitive conditions and government regulations permit  we seek to reduce the potential impact of inflation by negotiating price escalation clauses into contracts 
recently issued accounting standards we have adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  for fiscal sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
as comptek has no items of other comprehensive income  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had any impact on our financial statement disclosures 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
we have also adopted sfas no 
for fiscal as a result of the amherst acquisition and  to a lesser extent  the adoption of sfas no 
 reportable segments have been modified in fiscal we expect to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for the fiscal quarter beginning april  or april   depending upon the outcome of the exposure draft currently proposed deferring the effective date of sfas no 
because we currently have minimal hedging activity and a lack of derivative instruments  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date field 
these date fields will need to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations  a situation commonly referred to as the year issue or year problem 
we completed our assessment of our internal systems  including our information technology systems and non information technology systems  for the potential impact of year issues 
we have also received communications from all of our major vendors and suppliers as to their respective states of readiness and plans for compliance 
in this regard  we have completed the conversion of our primary accounting and management information system 
the decision to convert was based upon information processing and management reporting enhancements available under the new system 
while such conversion was not initiated or accelerated due to the prospect of the year problem  the new system was represented to us as year compliant and this provides the ancillary benefit of addressing the year issue 
our own testing of the system and use today indicates that the system is year compliant 
the majority of the cost for the new system approximately  was included in our capital expenditures in fiscal remaining expenditures approximately  were included in our capital expenditures for fiscal deficiencies in non information technology systems recognition of the year  which were identified as a result of our internal assessment  have been corrected 
the cost of correction was not material 
ancillary management information systems used by comptek and its subsidiaries have also been evaluated 
specific upgrades to achieve year compliance were covered under existing maintenance agreements or were purchased and installed by march  the upgrade and testing of the payroll systems is scheduled to be completed by july  other than the capital expenditures noted in the preceding paragraph  the company has spent less than  on year compliance upgrades and currently expects total expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately  in addition to the testing of its primary information management systems  we have tested all of the personal computers currently in use 
for contingency purposes  we budgeted an additional  for capital expenditures on such items in its fiscal year beginning april  while we continue to evaluate the compliance activities of our vendors and suppliers  we are satisfied with the responses received to date and do not anticipate any material adverse impact on our financial condition as it relates to vendors and suppliers year compliance 
we will  to the extent feasible  be testing such products for compliance  but can offer no assurances that our vendors and suppliers will in fact be year compliant 
the dod and its departments and agencies are our largest customer group  representing approximately of our net sales 
we believe that the us government  including the dod  has and is undertaking substantial efforts to address the year problem 
the government has represented to us that its contract payment system is year compliant 
however  we have no means of independent verification of the payment system and can offer no assurances as to the dod s readiness 
the full potential impact of the dod s non readiness is unknown at this time 
a failure by the dod to adequately address the year problem could  among other things  result in payment delays and contract administration delays which may result in a need for increased borrowing and interest expense to satisfy our operational and capital expenditure needs 
based on currently available information  we believe that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario revolves around two factors i a failure or substantial curtailment of basic power and communication services  and ii payment and contract administration delays 
we continue to evaluate contingency plans 
with respect to administrative systems  such as purchasing  contract administration  and accounting  temporary manual systems could be relied on  if necessary 
in many instances  the establishment of a contingency plan related to basic power and communications may not be possible or may be cost prohibitive 
in order to address potential payment and contract delays  the company s current credit facility includes a million line of credit for working capital 
also  consistent with the company s overall cash management practices  a close liaison is maintained with the defense contract management agency to address potential payment and contract administration issues 
the software programs written by our personnel and currently in use by customers are believed to be year compliant 
during fiscal  we received a satisfactory rating as a result of dod evaluation of our year compliance 
inasmuch as the programs supplied by us are used in conjunction with operating and other systems furnished by other suppliers  the overall compliance of such systems is  in part  dependent upon third parties 
we expect to continue to evaluate the compliance activities of our contract vendors and suppliers  but are satisfied with the responses received to date 
we have evaluated and will continue to consider our  and our subcontractors  warranty obligations relative to the year problem 
we have not received any warranty claims relating to the year problem and do not currently anticipate any such claims of a material nature 
while we do not currently anticipate a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations  we can offer no assurances that the year problem will not adversely impact comptek 
accordingly  we expect on an on going basis to continue to evaluate the year problem and its potential impact on comptek and our industry group 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk comptek s revolving credit note and term note ii have variable interest rates based on libor 
at march   million was outstanding under these facilities 
if libor was to change by  the impact on total interest expense would be approximately  annually 
in order to provide for interest rate protection with respect to the variable rate long term debt  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converts million of this outstanding debt to a fixed rate of 
a change in libor would not have a material impact on the fair value of the interest rate swap or the company s results from operations or cash flows 
at march   the carrying value of comptek s long term debt was million compared to an estimated fair value of million 
a increase in the rates offered to the company would result in a projected fair value at march  of million 
forward looking information and cautionary statement the annual report  including this management s discussion and analysis  contains forward looking statements about comptek s plans and management s expectations  including the company s role in the defense industry  our views on the growth prospects for the company  and year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
plans may also change based upon changing business conditions 
the reader is cautioned that such risks and uncertainties could cause actual future results to differ materially from those inferred by the forward looking statements 
since the company s primary customer group is the us government approximately of revenues for are attributable to dod prime and subcontracts  future results could be materially affected by the government s redirection  contract modification or termination  or similar actions  to stop or delay contract performance  government budgetary actions and response to year issues  and contracting and payment practices of current and future customers 
some additional uncertainties  among others  that also need to be considered are the likelihood that actual future revenues that are realized may differ from those inferred from existing total backlog  the ability of the company to attract and retain highly skilled technical and professional employees  the availability of capital  the ability to expand sales in international markets  and the ability to complete future acquisitions without adversely affecting the company s financial condition 
the company may also be adversely affected by changes in domestic and international economic conditions  technological developments  and intense competition 
the reader is further cautioned that risks and uncertainties exist that have not been mentioned herein due to their unforeseeable nature  but which  nevertheless  may impact the company s future operations and results
