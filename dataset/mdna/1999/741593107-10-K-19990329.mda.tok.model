net income 
comparison of to in  the company reported record net sales of  this compares to net sales of  in  an increase of 
this sales increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of bell industries graphic imaging group bell acquisition in september excluding the effect of the bell acquisition  sales of digital presses had strong growth and consumable sales increased slightly 
sales of electronic prepress systems decreased  which tended to offset most of the overall internal sales growth 
excluding one time items for both years  net income for was  or 
per diluted share  which was slightly below the  or 
per share for after a one time pre tax restructure and other charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter due to completing the integration process for the recent acquisition and aligning the company into three regions  the company reported net income in of  or 
per share 
this compares to net income reported in of  or 
per share  which includes a million gain on the sale of a capital lease  a million electronic equipment inventory write down and a million loss on a business divestiture 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in  before including the effect of the million electronic equipment inventory write down in the improvement in is primarily the result of stronger margins from systems sales  increased digital press sales with higher margins and higher margins from the bell business 
including the inventory write down  the gross profit percentage in was 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased from in to in this increase is primarily due to additional personnel costs associated with electronic prepress sales 
in addition  the benefits of integrating the bell acquisition will not occur until the beginning of in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a restructure and other charge of million related to reorganizing the company into three regions and integrating the bell operations 
the costs incurred were for employee severances and closure of duplicate facilities 
we anticipate the savings from this reorganization will bring the percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses to sales to levels consistent or lower than preceding years 
in  the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to  from  in the company has benefited from strict credit policies and the current strong economy 
interest expense increased from  in to  in this increase is attributable to the debt associated with the bell acquisition 
in  the company sold a capital lease for a gain of million and disposed of a business operation for a loss of million 
in  there were no similar disposals 
the effective income tax rate increased from in to in the higher rate in is primarily due to non deductible expenses being a higher percent of income in compared to the difference between the effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of for both years is primarily attributable to the effect of state income taxes and non deductible expenses 
comparison of to net income for was  or 
per diluted share compared to  or 
per share in there were three significant items which affected the results for  a million inventory write down  a million gain on the sale of a capital lease  and a million loss on a business divestiture 
excluding these items  net income for would have been a record  
per share  a increase over net income 
net sales in were  compared to  in  an increase of 
this sales increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of five vgc corporation locations in  one in august and four in november excluding the impact of the vgc acquisition  sales increased modestly 
in  the company centralized the electronic equipment inventory 
in conjunction with this centralization  the company expensed million to cost of sales for the write down of the existing branch inventory to current market value 
this charge to cost of sales resulted in the gross profit percent decreasing from in to in excluding this charge  the gross profit percent would have been  the same as in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased from in to in the company benefited by the economies of merging the vgc business into its existing business  plus the continued efforts to reduce costs within the company 
these gains were partially offset by additional staffing for systems sales 
interest expense increased from  in to  in this increase is primarily due to the debt associated with the vgc acquisition 
the effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the lower rate in is primarily due to non deductible expenses being a lesser percent of income in compared to financial condition and liquidity cash used in operating activities was  and  in and  respectively 
cash provided by operations was  in excluding the effect of changes in assets and liabilities  the cash provided was  and million for  and  respectively 
the company believes with the conversion of the bell locations onto the company business system and an emphasis on managing assets  the working capital levels will decrease in  resulting in improved cash flows for the year 
cash flow used by investing activities was  and  in and  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the use of capital in and was primarily the result of acquired businesses 
in comparison  in the company received million on the sale of a capital lease 
in the three years  property and equipment expenditures ranged between and million 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at december  capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million 
cash flows from financing activities were  provided in   used in  and  provided in the cash provided in and was primarily from additional debt and was used for acquisitions 
the cash used in was primarily for the repayment of debt and was primarily provided from the proceeds from the sale of the capital lease and the business divestiture 
the company s primary source of debt financing is a revolving credit agreement with a commitment of million 
in addition  the company has an uncommitted line that was million at the end of the year and has subsequently been increased to million 
total borrowings under these lines were million at december  the company believes these sources of borrowing  combined with cash from operations  is sufficient to support the current capital requirements of the company 
procedures for year issues the company s business system will require program modifications prior to the year for what is commonly referred to as the year issue 
similar to other systems  the system currently abbreviates the year to a two digit number 
as currently programmed  this abbreviation will cause many of the functions within the system which are date sensitive to operate improperly or malfunction in the year the business system was initially installed in the system was acquired from a software manufacturer and was modified to meet certain company requirements 
since the initial installation  the software manufacturer has made several upgrades to the product  including making the software year compliant 
historically  the company has elected not to install the available system upgrades because of the potential additional programming costs of making any required changes to the custom modifications made 
to become year compliant and  in addition  to take advantage of other enhancements in the software  the company has decided to install the manufacturer s software upgrades 
in addition  the company has contracted with the manufacturer to make the necessary programming changes required as a result of the company s separate custom modifications to the program 
the manufacturer was scheduled to complete the changes for testing by the company by the end of january however  this date has been extended to the end of february due to meeting delays between the company and the manufacturer as a result of timing conflicts with the conversion of the bell locations to the business system 
testing and implementation are scheduled to be completed by the end of april 
the company believes it has allowed adequate time  including time for any additional delays  to complete the project prior to the year accordingly  at this time  the company has not made any formal contingency plans 
the total cost of the system improvements  which incorporate the year compliance  are estimated to be  of which approximately  had been expended through december  no other significant information system additions have been postponed as a result of this project 
with regard to potential implications to the company of suppliers not being year compliant  the company through questionnaires and direct contact with major suppliers  is in the process of reviewing the status of their compliance 
at this time  the company is not aware of any compliance problem with any of its significant suppliers and  in addition  the company has access to competing products for nearly any customer s needs 
with regard to the company s customer base  the company is not requesting any specific information from its customers 
the company has over  customers and does not feel the potential exposures justify the cost and problems associated with surveying this customer base 
the company does share information electronically with certain customers and is working with these customers with regard to potential transmission problems 
the company recognizes that some electronic equipment it sold in earlier years may not be year compliant and could result in claims against the company as well as the manufacturer of the equipment 
the company believes it would have several defenses to any such claims  but it is unable to estimate what the aggregate cost of defending and or settling such claims would be 
with regard to other areas of exposure  the company s facilities consist primarily of leased warehouse facilities in large metropolitan areas using local utilities 
with regard to communication lines  the business system lines are through a major supplier who has provided assurances they will be year compliant 
as the company does not have any specific contract services with power companies or other utilities or sophisticated production equipment  it is not subject to many of the potential problems of manufacturing or certain service environments 
however  due to the interdependence of telecommunication  power and other utility services and the other general uncertainties of this issue  the company is unable to determine whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes new procedures for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing standards 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company currently uses interest rate swap agreements swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of the company s floating rate debt 
under current accounting standards  no gain or loss is recognized on changes in the fair value of these swaps 
under this statement  gains or losses will be recognized based on changes in the fair value of the swaps which generally occur as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company is currently evaluating the financial impact of adoption of the statement 
the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
market sensitive instruments and risk management the company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risks 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparty is a major commercial bank 
at december   the company had one derivative financial instrument  an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
this swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on a like amount of the company s floating rate debt at plus the company s libor spread in effect at the time 
the effective rate was at december  the swap expires on november  a basis point downward parallel shift in the yield curve would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition
