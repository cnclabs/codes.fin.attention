year computer system compliance the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  rather than a four digit format to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the yk issue could effect the company s products  computers  software and other equipment used  operated or maintained by the company 
accordingly  the company has completed the process of assessing the readiness of its software product offerings  internal infrastructure and major suppliers 
with the company s acquisitions in fiscal it became a software developer and owner of technology for the first time 
the company has completed testing its current product offerings for yk compliance 
based on its review to date  the company believes that the current versions of its cadra tm  prospector tm and toolmaker tm and tooldesigner tm products are yk compliant 
however  management also believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all yk issues affecting the company s software products have been identified or corrected due to the complexity of these products and the fact that these products interact with other third party vendor products and operate on computer systems which are not under the company s control 
the company believes that it has identified the major computers  software applications and related equipment used in connection with its mission critical internal operations and has completed an assessment of these systems in regards to yk compliance 
during fiscal  the company replaced its financial computer software including all underlying subledger modules with a third party package that is yk compliant 
the company expects to continue testing its internal systems and to undertake necessary corrective measures  if necessary  throughout the remainder of calendar year the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers of the major computers  software and other equipment used  operated or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving yk 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
where the company believes that a particular vendor or supplier poses unacceptable yk risks  it will identify an alternative supply source 
to date  costs incurred in our yk compliance efforts include the allocation of personnel to test our products and systems as well as to upgrade internal systems 
the out of pocket cost of purchasing the new financial computer software was approximately  to date  yk compliance efforts performed by the company s internal resources have not been material nor does the company expect the yk problem to have a material impact on its business or operating results 
the company expects to identify and resolve yk issues that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all yk issues affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the company cannot predict the nature or materiality of the impact on its operations or operating results of yk disruption by parties over whom it has no control 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of the company s customers or potential customers may be affected by yk issues if they must expend significant resources to correct their own systems 
as a result  they may have fewer funds available to purchase the company s products and services 
as part of its yk compliance planning process  the company will also consider contingency plans to be implemented if the need arises 
depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any yk issues that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could affect the company s financial condition and results of operations
