forward looking information the company and its subsidiaries  and their representatives  may make written or oral statements from time to time  including statements contained in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  and in its reports to shareholders  including this annual report  which constitutes or contains forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  or by the sec in its rules  regulations and releases 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this annual report  regarding the company s financial position  operating and strategic initiatives and addressing industry developments  are forward looking statements 
in any forward looking statement where the company  or its management  expresses an expectation or belief as to future results  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis 
but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result  be achieved  or be accomplished 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  general economic  financial and business conditions  competition in the product enhancement industry particularly the hot stamping sector  the availability and cost of raw materials  the success and costs of the company s consolidation and integration efforts  the availability and terms of capital  the business abilities and judgment of personnel  the costs and effects of legal proceedings  the impacts of unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of business strategies  and changes in business strategy 
other matters year management believes that substantially all of its computer systems  including those of holopak  are  or will be  year compliant 
the company has performed an assessment of its year readiness and has established an implementation plan to address year issues 
the company s assessment included financial  operational and information systems 
the majority of the company s manufacturing equipment does not include software or have embedded microprocessors  and of those that do  all have been determined to be year compliant 
as a result of the assessment phase  the hewlett packard unix platform on which the company operates its software was upgraded in order to be yk compliant 
the new server  at a cost of  was installed in the second quarter of and is operational 
as a result of the recent acquisition of holopak  the company has decided to implement a new software application  which is yk compliant 
the cost of the software is  it is to be installed and tested in the third quarter of calendar year the company currently does not believe that any future costs necessary to ensure the company s yk readiness will have a material effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
in the event that the company s hardware is not replaced or modified in time  the most likely worst case scenario would affect the computer manufacturing system 
if the operating system could not correctly handle and beyond  then any database function that gets its date from today will be inaccurate 
this would still pose only minor problems  since all billing  shipping  invoicing and reporting is done with a manual date entry and allows for the selection of date ranges which can be correctly entered 
none of foilmark s or holopak s products are date sensitive 
hot stamping foils and supplies have no computerized equipment embedded in them  and pad printing machines have no date sensitive embedded microprocessors 
the company s new network hardware and software is fully compliant and not date sensitive 
foilmark has sent out yk questionnaires to suppliers  customers and critical service providers 
evaluations of foilmark s and holopak s critical suppliers was completed on june  although foilmark cannot control external suppliers and customers ability to be yk compliant  it can certainly express its concerns for not being compliant 
the questionnaire assesses whether the suppliers and customers are compliant and whether and to what extent they will be complaint prior to january  if respondents indicated non compliance  foilmark intends to assess the consequences and include any steps it deems necessary in its contingency plan  which has been completed 
yk compliance has been a senior management priority for some time 
the company believes that it has state of the art technology  which will not require as comprehensive a program as compared to older systems 
nevertheless  the company cannot reasonably predict the effect on its operations if customers  vendors and service providers are not yk compliant 
although senior management does not think this will be the case  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected in the first quarter of calendar results if its customers  vendors or service providers are not yk compliant
