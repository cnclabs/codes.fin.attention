see items and business and properties operations dental practice management model 
the company was formed with the intention of becoming the leading dental practice management company in colorado 
the company s success in the colorado market has led to its expansion into new mexico and arizona and its evaluation of additional markets 
the company commenced operations in colorado in october with the acquisition of three practices  and acquired a fourth practice in november during  the company developed five de novo offices and acquired practices including three practices which were consolidated with existing offices 
in  the company developed one de novo office and acquired practices 
in  the company developed five de novo offices and acquired practices 
in early  the company developed one de novo office and acquired one practice 
the combined purchase amounts for the four practices acquired in  the practices acquired in  the practices acquired in and the practices acquired in were    and  respectively 
eight of the company s de novo offices  which opened between january and may  began generating positive contribution from dental offices  on average  within three months of opening 
the company s four remaining de novo offices which have been open an average of three months  have not generated positive contribution from dental offices as of the date of this annual report 
see items and business and properties expansion program 
the company has experienced significant growth in net revenue as defined below and operating profitability 
the company has achieved these results primarily through the ongoing development of a dense dental practice network and the implementation of its dental practice management model 
the company s net revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   and increased million to million for the year ended december  contribution from dental offices has increased from  in to million for the year ended december   and increased million to million for the year ended december  contribution from dental offices as a percentage of net revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and to for the year ended december  operating income also improved from a loss of  for the year ended december  to an operating profit of  for the year ended december   and an operating profit of million for the year ended december at december   the company s total assets of million included million of identifiable intangible assets related to management agreements 
at that date  the company s total shareholders equity was million 
the company reviews the recorded amount of intangible assets and other fixed assets for impairment for each office whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if this review indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of each office  whether acquired or developed  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value 
among the factors that the company will continually evaluate are unfavorable changes in each office  relative market share and local market competitive environment  current period and forecasted operating results  cash flow levels of offices and the impact on the net revenue earned by the company  and the legal and regulatory factors governing the practice of dentistry 
year the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs that have date sensitive software or equipment that has time sensitive embedded components may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to upgrade its computer software to programs that will consistently and properly recognize the year the company utilizes off the shelf or third party production software and has recently purchased new hardware  software and software upgrades from vendors who have represented that these systems are year compliant 
the company s expenditures and anticipated future expenditures for this remediation are expected to be less than  in addition  the company is in the process of identifying non information systems operation critical applications that have date sensitive software or equipment that has time sensitive embedded components 
the company expects to complete this assessment during the second quarter of the company may also be vulnerable to other companies year issues 
the company s current estimates of the impact of the year problem on its operations and financial results do not include costs and time that may be incurred as a result of any vendors or customers failures to become year compliant on a timely basis 
the company initiated formal communications with all of its significant insurance payors and vendors during the third quarter of with respect to the status of their year compliance programs and has only begun to receive responses 
however  there can be no assurance that these companies will achieve year compliance or that their conversions to become year compliant will be compatible with the company s systems 
the inability of the company s significant vendors or insurance payors to become year compliant in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company presently anticipates that it will complete its year remediation by december  however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its year plan according to the anticipated schedule 
in addition  the company may be adversely affected by the inability of other companies whose systems interact with the company s to become year compliant 
although the company expects its internal systems will be year compliant as described above  the company intends to prepare a contingency plan that will specify what it plans to do if it or important external companies are not year compliant in a timely manner 
the company expects to prepare its contingency plan during fiscal components of revenue and expenses total dental group practice revenue revenue represents the revenue of the offices  reported at estimated realizable amounts  received from third party payors and patients for dental services rendered at the offices 
net revenue represents revenue less amounts retained by the offices 
the amounts retained by the offices represent amounts paid as salary  benefits and other payments to employed dentists and hygienists 
the company s net revenue is dependent on the revenue of the offices 
management service fee revenue represents the net revenue earned by the company for the offices for which the company has management agreements  but does not have control 
direct expenses consist of the expenses incurred by the company in connection with managing the offices  including salaries and benefits for personnel other than dentists and hygienists  dental supplies  dental laboratory fees  occupancy costs  advertising and marketing  depreciation and amortization and general and administrative including office supplies  equipment leases  management information systems and other expenses related to dental practice operations 
the company also incurs personnel and administrative expenses in connection with maintaining a corporate function that provides management  administrative  marketing  development and professional services to the offices 
under each of the management agreements  the company manages the business and marketing aspects of the offices  including i providing capital  ii designing and implementing marketing programs  iii negotiating for the purchase of supplies  iv providing a patient scheduling system  v staffing  vi recruiting  vii training of non dental personnel  viii billing and collecting patient fees  ix arranging for certain legal and accounting services  and x negotiating with managed care organizations 
the pc is responsible for  among other things  i employing and supervising all dentists and dental hygienists  ii complying with all laws  rules and regulations relating to dentists and dental hygienists  and iii maintaining proper patient records 
the company has made  and intends to make in the future  loans to pcs in colorado  new mexico and arizona to fund their acquisition of dental assets from third parties in order to comply with the laws of such states 
bonuses payable to dentists based on the operating performance of the pcs take into account principal and interest payments made on the loans  resulting in the dentists sharing the economic benefits or detriments associated with assets acquired by the pcs using such loans with the company 
because the company s financial statements are consolidated with the financial statements of the pcs  these loans are eliminated in consolidation 
under the typical management agreement used by the company  the pc pays the company a management fee equal to the adjusted gross center revenue of the pc less compensation paid to the dentists and dental hygienists employed by the pc adjusted gross center revenue is comprised of all fees and charges booked each month by or on behalf of the pc as a result of dental services provided to patients at the office  less any adjustments for uncollectible accounts  professional courtesies and other activities that do not generate a collectible fee 
the company s costs include all direct and indirect costs  overhead and expenses relating to the company s provision of management services at the office under the management agreement  including i salaries  benefits and other direct costs of employees who work at the office  ii direct costs of all company employees or consultants who provide services to or in connection with the office  iii utilities  janitorial  laboratory  supplies  advertising and other expenses incurred by the company in carrying out its obligations under the management agreement  iv depreciation expense associated with the pc s assets and the assets of the company used at the office  and the amortization of intangible asset value as a result of any acquisition or merger of another dental practice relating to the office  v interest expense on indebtedness incurred by the company to finance any of its obligations under the management agreement  vi general and malpractice insurance expenses  lease expenses and dentist recruitment expenses  vii personal property and other taxes assessed against the company s or the pc s assets used in connection with the operation of the office  viii out of pocket expenses of the company s personnel related to mergers or acquisitions involving the pc  ix corporate overhead charges or any other expenses of company including the pc s pro rata share of the expenses of the accounting and computer services provided by the company  and x a collection reserve in the amount of of adjusted gross center revenue 
as a result  substantially all costs associated with the provision of dental services at the office are borne by the company  other than the compensation and benefits of the dentists and hygienists who are employed by the pcs this enables the company to manage the profitability of the offices 
each management agreement is for a term of years 
further  each management agreement generally may be terminated by the pc only for cause  which includes a material default by or bankruptcy of the company 
upon expiration or termination of a management agreement by either party  the pc must satisfy all obligations it has to the company 
the company s revenue is derived principally from fee for service revenue and revenue from capitated managed dental care plans 
fee for service revenue consists of pc revenue received from indemnity dental plans  preferred provider plans and direct payments by patients not covered by any third party payment arrangement 
managed dental care revenue consists of pc revenue received from capitated managed dental care plans  including capitation payments and patient co payments 
capitated managed dental care contracts are between dental benefits organizations and the pcs under the management agreements  the company negotiates and administers these contracts on behalf of the pcs under a capitated managed dental care contract  the dental group practice provides dental services to the members of the dental benefits organization and receives a fixed monthly capitation payment for each plan member covered for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services to the participating dental group practice obligated to provide them 
this arrangement shifts the risk of utilization of these services to the dental group practice providing the dental services 
because the company assumes responsibility under the management agreements for all aspects of the operation of the dental practices other than the practice of dentistry and thus bears all costs of the pcs associated with the provision of dental services at the office other than compensation and benefits of dentists and hygienists  the risk of over utilization of dental services at the office under capitated managed dental care plans is effectively shifted to the company 
in addition  dental group practices participating in a capitated managed dental care plan often receive supplemental payments for more complicated or elective procedures 
in contrast  under traditional indemnity insurance arrangements  the insurance company pays whatever reasonable charges are billed by the dental group practice for the dental services provided 
see items and business and properties payor mix 
the company seeks to increase its fee for service business by increasing the patient volume of existing offices through effective marketing and advertising programs  opening new offices and acquiring solo and group practices 
the company seeks to supplement this fee for service business with revenue from contracts with capitated managed dental care plans 
although the company s fee for service business generally is more profitable than its capitated managed dental care business  capitated managed dental care business serves to increase facility utilization and dentist productivity 
the relative percentage of the company s revenue derived from fee for service business and capitated managed dental care contracts varies from market to market depending on the availability of capitated managed dental care contracts in any particular market and the company s ability to negotiate favorable contractual terms 
in addition  the profitability of managed dental care revenue varies from market to market depending on the level of capitation payments and co payments in proportion to the level of benefits required to be provided 
variations in the relative penetration and popularity of capitated managed dental care from market to market across the country  however  make it difficult to determine whether the company s experience in new markets will be consistent with its experience in the company s existing markets 
the company expects that the level of profitability of its operations in new markets entered through acquisition will vary depending in part on these factors and may not replicate or be comparable to the company s current results 
results of operations as a result of the ongoing expansion of its business through acquisitions and the development of de novo offices  and the company s limited period of affiliation with these offices  the company believes that the period to period comparisons set forth below may not be representative of future operating results 
the company has experienced significant year to year growth in revenue

the company acquired practices and opened five de novo offices during  which  in the aggregate  contributed million of the million increase

under the company s credit facility as amended on december   during its three year term  the company may borrow up to million for working capital needs 
advances will bear interest at the lender s base rate or at the applicable libor rate plus  at the company s option  and the company will be obligated to pay an annual facility fee of 
of the average unused amount of the line of credit during the previous full calendar quarter 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on the company s adjusted ebitda 
at december   the company had total outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on the company s accounts receivable and its management agreements 
the credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends and other distributions to shareholders  restricts or prohibits the company from incurring indebtedness  incurring liens  disposing of assets  making investments or making acquisitions  and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis 
as of december   the company had outstanding indebtedness of approximately  represented by notes issued in connection with various practice acquisitions which bear interest at rates varying from to 
at december  the company s material commitments for capital expenditures totaled approximately million  consisting of approximately  for the expansion of two offices and approximately  for each of nine planned de novo office developments

the company s retained earnings as of december  were approximately  and the company had working capital on that date of approximately million 
the company completed on february  a public offering of  shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
at december   the company has fully expended the proceeds from the initial public offering 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility and to repay the million note issued in connection with the gentle dental acquisition 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility  will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and future acquisitions for at least the next months 
in the event the company is not able to successfully negotiate a new credit facility at the end of its term or identifies and completes future acquisitions more quickly than it currently anticipates  the company s current sources of liquidity may not be adequate 
in addition  in order to meet its long term liquidity needs the company may issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its strategy and could negatively affect its operations in future periods

actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  without limitation  the risk factors set forth below and the matters set forth in this annual report generally 
demands on management from growth  limited operating history 
the company has been providing dental practice management services since october although the company provides management services for offices  the company has been providing management services to of these offices for less than one year 
prior to april  the company provided dental practice management services exclusively in colorado 
the company s growth has placed  and will continue to place  strains on the company s management  operations and systems 
the growth has required the hiring and training of additional employees to oversee the operations and training of non dental employees in the new offices  the use of management resources to integrate the operations of the new offices with the operations of the company  and the incurring of incremental costs to convert to or install the company s management information system 
the company s ability to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to hire  train and assimilate additional management and other employees  and its ability to expand  improve and effectively utilize its operating  management  marketing and financial systems to accommodate its expanded operations 
any failure by the company s management effectively to anticipate  implement and manage the changes required to sustain the company s growth may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
see items and business and properties expansion program 
risks associated with acquisition strategy 
the company has grown substantially in a relatively short period of time  in large part through acquisitions of existing offices and through the development of de novo offices 
since its organization in may  the company has completed dental practice acquisitions including one acquisition in february  three of which have been consolidated into existing offices 
the success of the company s acquisition strategy will depend on factors  which include the following ability to identify suitable dental practices 
the company devotes substantial time and resources to acquisition related activities 
identifying appropriate acquisition candidates and negotiating and consummating acquisitions can be a lengthy and costly process 
furthermore  the company may compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified or that acquisitions will be consummated on terms favorable to the company  on a timely basis or at all 
if a planned acquisition fails to occur or is delayed  the company s quarterly financial results may be materially lower than analysts expectations  which likely would cause a decline  perhaps substantial  in the market price of the common stock 
in addition  increasing consolidation in the dental management services industry may result in an increase in purchase prices required to be paid by the company to acquire dental practices 
integration of dental practices 
the integration of acquired dental practices into the company s networks is a difficult  costly and time consuming process which  among other things  requires the company to attract and retain competent and experienced management and administrative personnel and to implement and integrate reporting and tracking systems  management information systems and other operating systems 
in addition  such integration may require the expansion of accounting controls and procedures and the evaluation of certain personnel functions 
there can be no assurance that substantial unanticipated problems  costs or delays associated with such integration efforts or with such acquired practices will not occur 
as the company pursues its acquisition strategy  there can be no assurance that the company will be able successfully to integrate acquired practices in a timely manner or at all  or that any acquired practices will have a positive impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
management of acquisitions 
the success of the company s acquisition strategy will depend in part on the company s ability to manage effectively an increasing number of offices  some of which are expected to be located in markets geographically distant from markets in which the company presently operates 
the addition of offices may impair the company s ability to provide management services efficiently and successfully to existing offices and to manage and supervise adequately the company s employees 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to do so effectively 
availability of funds for acquisitions 
the company s acquisition strategy will require that substantial capital investment and adequate financing be available to the company 
funds are needed for i the purchase of assets of dental practices  ii the integration of operations of acquired dental practices  and iii the purchase of additional equipment and technology for acquired practices 
in addition  increasing consolidation in the dental services industry may result in an increase in purchase prices required to be paid by the company to acquire dental practices 
any inability of the company to obtain suitable financing could cause the company to limit or otherwise modify its acquisition strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
see risk factors need for additional capital  uncertainty of additional financing in this item ability to increase revenues and operating income of acquired practices 
a key element of the company s growth strategy is to increase revenues and operating income at its acquired offices 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues and operating income from its acquired offices will improve at rates comparable to the historical improvement rates experienced by the company s existing offices or at all  or that revenues or operating income from existing offices will continue to improve at such historical rates or at all 
any failure by the company in improving revenues or operating income at its offices could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with de novo office development 
the company intends to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to identify locations in suitable markets for the development of de novo offices 
identifying locations in suitable geographic markets and negotiating leases can be a lengthy and costly process 
furthermore  the company will need to provide each new office with the appropriate equipment  furnishings  materials and supplies 
to date  the company s average cost to open a de novo office has been approximately  future de novo development may require a greater investment by the company 
additionally  new offices must be staffed with one or more dentists 
because a new office may be staffed with a dentist with no previous patient base  significant advertising and marketing expenditures may be required to attract patients 
there can be no assurance that a de novo office will become profitable for the company

dependence on management agreements  the pcs and affiliated dentists 
the company receives management fees for services provided to the pcs under management agreements 
the company owns most of the non dental operating assets of the offices but does not employ or contract with dentists  employ hygienists or control the provision of dental care 
the company s revenue is dependent on the revenue generated by the pcs therefore  effective and continued performance of dentists providing services for the pcs is essential to the company s long term success 
under each management agreement  the company pays substantially all of the operating and non operating expenses associated with the provision of dental services except for the salaries and benefits of the dentists and hygienists and principal and interest payments of loans made to the pc by the company 
any material loss of revenue by the pcs would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results  and any termination of a management agreement which is permitted in the event of a material default or bankruptcy by either party could have such an effect 
in the event of a breach of a management agreement by a pc  there can be no assurance that the legal remedies available to the company will be adequate to compensate the company for its damages resulting from such breach

government regulation 
the practice of dentistry is regulated at both the state and federal levels 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company or pcs operate will not change significantly in the future 
in addition  state and federal laws regulate health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations for which dentists may be providers 
in general  regulation of health care companies is increasing 
in connection with its operations in existing markets and expansion into new markets  the company may become subject to additional laws  regulations and interpretations or enforcement actions 
the laws regulating health care are broad and subject to varying interpretations  and there is currently a lack of case law construing such statutes and regulations 
the ability of the company to operate profitably will depend in part upon the ability of the company to operate in compliance with applicable health care regulations 
the laws of many states  including colorado and new mexico  permit a dentist to conduct a dental practice only as an individual  a member of a partnership or an employee of a professional corporation  limited liability company or limited liability partnership 
these laws typically prohibit  either by specific provision or as a matter of general policy  non dental entities  such as the company  from practicing dentistry  from employing dentists and  in certain circumstances  hygienists or dental assistants  or from otherwise exercising control over the provision of dental services 
many states  including colorado  limit the ability of a person other than a licensed dentist to own or control dental equipment or offices used in a dental practice 
in addition  arizona  colorado  new mexico  and many other states impose limits on the tasks that may be delegated by dentists to hygienists and dental auxiliaries 
some states  including arizona  colorado and new mexico  regulate the content of advertisements of dental services 
some states require entities designated as clinics to be licensed  and may define clinics to include dental practices that are owned or controlled in whole or in part by non dentists 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
many states  including colorado and new mexico  also prohibit fee splitting by dentists with any party except other dentists in the same professional corporation or practice entity 
in most cases  these laws have been construed as applying to the practice of paying a portion of a fee to another person for referring a patient or otherwise generating business  and not to prohibit payment of reasonable compensation for facilities and services other than the generation of referrals  even if the payment is based on a percentage of the practice s revenues 
many states have fraud and abuse laws  which apply to referrals for items or services reimbursable by any third party payor  not just by medicare and medicaid 
a number of states  including arizona  colorado and new mexico  prohibit the submitting of false claims for dental services 
in addition  there are certain regulatory risks associated with the company s role in negotiating and administering managed care contracts 
the application of state insurance laws to third party payor arrangements  other than fee for service arrangements  is an unsettled area of law with little guidance available 
specifically  in some states  regulators may determine that the pcs are engaged in the business of insurance  particularly if they contract on a financial risk basis directly with self insured employers or other entities that are not licensed to engage in the business of insurance 
if the pcs are determined to be engaged in the business of insurance  the company may be required to change the method of payment from third party payors and the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
federal laws generally regulate reimbursement and billing practices under medicare and medicaid programs 
the federal fraud and abuse statute prohibits  among other things  the payment  offer  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration  directly or indirectly  in cash or in kind to induce or in exchange for i the referral of a person for services reimbursable by medicare or medicaid  or ii the purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase  lease or order of any item  good  facility or service which is reimbursable under medicare or medicaid 
because the pcs receive no revenue under medicare and medicaid  the impact of these laws on the company to date has been negligible 
there can be no assurance  however  that the pcs will not have patients in the future covered by these laws  or that the scope of these laws will not be expanded in the future  and if expanded  such laws or interpretations thereunder could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
although the company believes that its operations as currently conducted are in material compliance with applicable laws  there can be no assurance that the company s contractual arrangements will not be successfully challenged as violating applicable fraud and abuse  self referral  false claims  fee splitting  insurance  facility licensure or certificate of need laws or that the enforceability of such arrangements will not be limited as a result of such laws 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the business structure under which the company operates  or the advertising strategy the company employs  will not be deemed to constitute the unlicensed practice of dentistry or the operation of an unlicensed clinic or health care facility 
the company has not sought judicial or regulatory interpretations with respect to the manner in which it conducts its business 
there can be no assurance that a review of the business of the company and the pcs by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could materially and adversely affect their operations or that the regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the company s existing or future operations 
in the event that any legislative measures  regulatory provisions or rulings or judicial decisions restrict or prohibit the company from carrying on its business or from expanding its operations to certain jurisdictions  structural and organizational modifications of the company s organization and arrangements may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  or the company may be required to cease operations or change the way it conducts business

need for additional capital  uncertainty of additional financing 
implementation of the company s growth strategy has required and is expected to continue to require significant capital resources 
such resources will be needed to acquire or establish additional offices  maintain or upgrade the company s management information systems  and for the effective integration  operation and expansion of the offices 
the company historically has used principally cash and promissory notes as consideration in acquisitions of dental practices and intends to continue to do so 
if the company s capital requirements over the next several years exceed cash flow generated from operations and borrowings available under the company s existing credit facility or any successor credit facility  the company may need to issue additional equity securities and incur additional debt 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  dilution to the company s existing shareholders may result 
additional debt or non common stock equity financings could be required to the extent that the common stock fails to maintain a market value sufficient to warrant its use for future financing needs 
if additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt  such debt instruments will likely contain restrictive financial  maintenance and security covenants 
the company s existing credit facility limits the amount the company may spend in any calendar year to acquire dental practices 
the company may not be able to obtain additional required capital on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance the expansion of the company s operations or the company s other capital requirements could have a material and adverse effect on the company s ability to pursue its strategy and on its business  financial condition and operating results 
see liquidity and capital resources in this item reliance on certain personnel 
the success of the company  including its ability to complete and integrate acquisitions  depends on the continued services of a relatively limited number of members of the company s senior management  including its president  mark birner  dds  its chief executive officer  fred birner  and its chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  dennis genty 
some key employees have only recently joined the company 
the company believes its future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and the company competes for qualified personnel with numerous other employers  some of which have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the loss of the services of one or more members of the company s senior management or the failure to add or retain qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
dependence upon availability of dentists and other personnel 
the company s operations and expansion strategy are dependent on the availability and successful recruitment and retention of dentists  dental assistants  hygienists  specialists and other personnel 
the company may not be able to recruit or retain dentists and other personnel for its existing and newly established offices  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s expansion strategy and its business  financial condition and operating results 
see items and business and properties operations dental practice model 
risks associated with cost containment initiatives 
the health care industry  including the dental services market  is experiencing a trend toward cost containment  as payors seek to impose lower reimbursement rates upon providers 
the company believes that this trend will continue and will increasingly affect the provision of dental services 
this may result in a reduction in per patient and per procedure revenue from historic levels 
significant reductions in payments to dentists or other changes in reimbursement by payors for dental services may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
risks associated with capitated payment arrangements 
part of the company s growth strategy involves selectively obtaining capitated managed dental care contracts 
under a capitated managed dental care contract  the dental practice provides dental services to the members of the plan and receives a fixed monthly capitation payment for each plan member covered for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services to the participating dental practice which is obligated to provide them  and may receive a co pay for each service provided 
this arrangement shifts the risk of utilization of such services to the dental group practice that provides the dental services 
because the company assumes responsibility under its management agreements for all aspects of the operation of the dental practices other than the practice of dentistry and thus bears all costs of the provision of dental services at the offices other than compensation and benefits of dentists and hygienists  the risk of over utilization of dental services at the offices under capitated managed dental care plans is effectively shifted to the company 
in contrast  under traditional indemnity insurance arrangements  the insurance company reimburses reasonable charges that are billed for the dental services provided 
in  the company derived approximately of its revenues from capitated managed dental care contracts  and of its revenues from associated co payments 
risks associated with capitated managed dental care contracts include principally i the risk that the capitation payments and any associated co payments do not adequately cover the costs of providing the dental services  ii the risk that one or more of the pcs may be terminated as an approved provider by managed dental care plans with which they contract  iii the risk that the company will be unable to negotiate future capitation arrangements on satisfactory terms with managed care dental plans  and iv the risk that large subscriber groups will terminate their relationship with such managed dental care plans which would reduce patient volume and capitation and co payment revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate future capitation arrangements on behalf of pcs on satisfactory terms or at all  or that the fees offered in current capitation arrangements will not be reduced to levels unsatisfactory to the company 
moreover  to the extent that costs incurred by the company s affiliated dental practices in providing services to patients covered by capitated managed dental care contracts exceed the revenue under such contracts  the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
see items and business and properties operations payor mix 
risks of becoming subject to licensure 
federal and state laws regulate insurance companies and certain other managed care organizations 
many states  including colorado  also regulate the establishment and operation of networks of health care providers 
in most states  these laws do not apply to discounted fee for service arrangements 
these laws also do not generally apply to networks that are paid on a capitated basis  unless the entity with which the network provider is contracting is not a licensed health insurer or other managed care organization 
there are exceptions to these rules in some states 
for example  certain states require a license for a capitated arrangement with any party unless the risk bearing entity is a professional corporation that employs the professionals 
the company believes its current activities do not constitute the provision of insurance in colorado or new mexico  and thus  it is in compliance with the insurance laws of these states with respect to the operation of its offices 
there can be no assurance that these laws will not be changed or that interpretations of these laws by the regulatory authorities in those states  or in the states in which the company expands  will not require licensure or a restructuring of some or all of the company s operations 
in the event that the company is required to become licensed under these laws  the licensure process can be lengthy and time consuming and  unless the regulatory authority permits the company to continue to operate while the licensure process is progressing  the company could experience a material adverse change in its business while the licensure process is pending 
in addition  many of the licensing requirements mandate strict financial and other requirements  which the company may not immediately be able to meet 
further  once licensed  the company would be subject to continuing oversight by and reporting to the respective regulatory agency 
the regulatory framework of certain jurisdictions may limit the company s expansion into  or ability to continue operations within  such jurisdictions if the company is unable to modify its operational structure to conform to such regulatory framework 
any limitation on the company s ability to expand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
risks arising from health care reform 
federal and state governments currently are considering various types of health care initiatives and comprehensive revisions to the health care and health insurance systems 
some of the proposals under consideration  or others that may be introduced  could  if adopted  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
it is uncertain what legislative programs  if any will be adopted in the future  or what action congress or state legislatures may take regarding health care reform proposals or legislation 
in addition  changes in the health care industry  such as the growth of managed care organizations and provider networks  may result in lower payments for the services of the company s managed practices 
risks associated with intangible assets 
at december   intangible assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet were million  representing of the company s total assets at that date 
the company expects the amount allocable to intangible assets on its balance sheet to increase in the future in connection with additional acquisitions  which will increase the company s amortization expense 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of the company or a portion of its assets  there can be no assurance that the value of the company s intangible assets will be realized 
in addition  the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred indicating that any portion of the remaining balance of the amount allocable to the company s intangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that the amount allocable to the company s intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company may be required to reduce the carrying value of such assets 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
possible exposure to professional liability 
in recent years  dentists have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice and related legal theories 
some of these lawsuits involve large claims and significant defense costs 
any suits involving the company or dentists at the offices  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards that may exceed the limits of the company s insurance coverage 
the company provides practice management services  it does not engage in the practice of dentistry or control the practice of dentistry by the dentists or their compliance with regulatory requirements directly applicable to providers 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not become subject to litigation in the future as a result of the dental services provided at the offices 
the company maintains professional liability insurance for itself and provides for professional liability insurance covering dentists  hygienists and dental assistants at the offices 
while the company believes it has adequate liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that the coverage will be adequate to cover losses or that coverage will continue to be available upon terms satisfactory to the company 
in addition  certain types of risks and liabilities  including penalties and fines imposed by governmental agencies  are not covered by insurance 
malpractice insurance  moreover  can be expensive and varies from state to state 
successful malpractice claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results

risks associated with non competition covenants and other arrangements with managing dentists 
the management agreements require the pcs to enter into employment agreements with dentists which include non competition provisions typically for three to five years after termination of employment within a specified geographic area  usually a specified number of miles from the relevant office  and restrict solicitation of employees and patients 
in colorado  covenants not to compete are prohibited by statute with certain exceptions 
one exception permits enforcement of covenants not to compete against executive and management personnel and officers and employees who constitute professional staff to executive and management personnel 
permitted covenants not to compete are enforceable in colorado only to the extent their terms are reasonable in both duration and geographic scope 
arizona and new mexico courts have enforced covenants not to compete if their terms are found to be reasonable 
it is thus uncertain whether a court will enforce a covenant not to compete in those states in a given situation 
in addition  there is little judicial authority regarding whether a practice management agreement will be viewed as the type of protectable business interest that would permit it to enforce such a covenant or to require a pc to enforce such covenants against dentists formerly employed by the pc since the intangible value of a management agreement depends primarily on the ability of the pc to preserve its business  which could be harmed if employed dentists went into competition with the pc  a determination that the covenants not to compete contained in the employment agreements between the pc and its employed dentists are unenforceable could have a material adverse impact on the company 
see items and business and properties affiliation model employment agreements 
in addition  the company is a party to various agreements with managing dentists who own the pcs  which restrict the dentists ability to transfer the shares in the pcs see items and business and properties affiliation model relationship with pcs there can be no assurance that these agreements will be enforceable in a given situation 
a determination that these agreements are not enforceable could have a material adverse impact on the company 
seasonality 
the company s past financial results have fluctuated somewhat due to seasonal variations in the dental service industry  with revenue typically declining in the fourth calendar quarter 
the company expects this seasonality to continue in the future 
year issues 
the company has implemented a program to attempt to assess  remediate and mitigate the potential impact of problems associated with the year a year problem is one where a system has time sensitive embedded components may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
if the company s efforts to remediate its year problems are not successful  or if any of the company s material third party vendors or payors are not year compliant  the company and or the pcs operating the offices may experience difficulty scheduling patient visits  communicating with patients  sending out billing statements and receiving payment for the provision of dental services 
if any such year problems persist  they could cause a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the dental practice management segment of the dental services industry is highly competitive and is expected to become increasingly more competitive 
there are several dental practice management companies that are operating in the company s markets 
there are also a number of companies with dental practice management businesses similar to that of the company currently operating in other parts of the country which may enter the company s existing markets in the future 
as the company seeks to expand its operations into new markets  it is likely to face competition from dental practice management companies  which already have established a strong business presence in such locations 
the company s competitors may have greater financial or other resources or otherwise enjoy competitive advantages  which may make it difficult for the company to compete against them or to acquire additional offices on terms acceptable to the company 
see items and business and properties competition 
the business of providing general dental and specialty dental services is highly competitive in the markets in which the company operates 
competition for providing dental services may include practitioners who have more established practices and reputations 
the company competes against established practices in the retention and recruitment of general dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel 
if the availability of such dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel begins to decline in the company s markets  it may become more difficult to attract qualified dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively against other existing practices or against new single or multi specialty dental practices that enter its markets  or to compete against such practices in the recruitment and retention of qualified dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel

volatility of stock price 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter by quarter variations in operating results of the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  developments in the industry or changes in general economic conditions 
restrictions on payment of dividends 
the company has not declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock since its formation  and the company does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends is prohibited under the terms of the company s existing credit facility and may be prohibited under any future credit facility  which the company may obtain

the company is exposed to market risk in the area of changes in united states interest rates 
historically and as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based upon the prime rate or libor at the company s option  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately million was outstanding with an interest rate of prime plus 
the line of credit matures on february  the company may repay the balance in full at any time without penalty 
as a result  the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company
