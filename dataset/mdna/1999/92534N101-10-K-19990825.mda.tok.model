item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview memberworks addresses the needs of organizations seeking to leverage the expertise of an outside provider in offering membership service programs 
membership service programs offer selected products and services from a variety of vendors intended to enhance the existing relationships between businesses and consumers 
the company derives its revenues principally from annually renewable membership fees 
the company receives full payment of annual fees at or near the beginning of the membership period  but recognizes revenue ratably over the membership period 
similarly  the costs associated with soliciting each new member  as well as the cost of royalties  are amortized ratably over the same period 
profitability and cash flow generated from renewal memberships exceed that of new memberships due to the absence of solicitation costs associated with new member procurement 
on september   the company issued a press release that stated it had contacted the securities and exchange commission sec to determine whether the sec staff s view regarding the timing of revenue recognition for companies such as memberworks that sell services had changed in the wake of cendant corporation s agreement announced on august  with the sec to modify its revenue recognition practices 
the company had requested the sec staff to comment on and has provided the sec staff with information demonstrating the continued appropriateness of its revenue recognition practices 
the company has consistently followed these practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and with the concurrence of pricewaterhousecoopers llp  its independent accountants 
as a result of this review and several discussions with the sec staff  the staff has not objected to the company s decision to presently continue to follow its revenue recognition practices  as described above 
the sec staff did request the company to change its method of accounting for printing and mailing of membership materials beginning july  the company has recorded the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the change and its financial impact 
on september   the sec issued a press release and stated the sec will formulate and augment new and existing accounting rules and interpretations covering revenue recognition  restructuring reserves  materiality and disclosure for all publicly traded companies 
until such time as the sec staff issues such interpretative guidelines  it is unclear what  if any  impact such interpretative guidance will have on the company s current accounting practices 
however  the potential changes in accounting practice being considered by the sec staff could have a material impact on the manner in which the company recognizes revenue 
any such changes would have no effect on reported cash flow or the economic value of the company s memberships

this testing has involved processing of customer files both by the company and its clients and vendors and the results have been positive 
based on the reviews and analysis performed by the company and an outside consultant and since a majority of its internal information technology systems have been developed or modified within the last years  the company believes that the risk of significant noncompliance of its internal information technology systems is minimal

because the company uses multiple vendors to process its billing transactions  its external risk is mitigated as vendors may be used interchangeably 
however  there can be no assurance that these  or other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems and operations 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s operations  liquidity or financial conditions 
however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s operations  liquidity or financial conditions 
certain factors affecting future results the preceding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the statements in liquidity and capital resources regarding the adequacy of funds to meet funding requirements 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  uncertainty as to new and existing accounting rules and interpretations  uncertainty as to the company s future profitability  the company s ability to develop and implement operational and financial systems to manage rapidly growing operations  competition in the company s existing and potential future lines of business  the company s ability to integrate and operate successfully acquired businesses and the risks associated with such businesses  the company s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance the company s growth strategy and for the company to operate within the limitation imposed by financial arrangements  uncertainty as to the future profitability of acquired businesses  the ability of the company and its vendors to complete the necessary actions to achieve a year conversion for its computer systems and applications  and other factors 
the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception 
although the company has experienced revenue growth and has reported net income in recent periods  such growth rates may not be sustainable and are not indicative of future operating results
