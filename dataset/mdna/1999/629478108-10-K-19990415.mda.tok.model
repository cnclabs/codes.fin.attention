for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations the results of operations for the year ended december  reflect a decrease in revenues  a decrease in cost of revenues  and a decrease in operating expenses from during  netrix continued to experience a decline in revenues in the product line it acquired from republic telcom  and an increase in its new products  the  which combines the republic technology with netrix switching capability  and the  netrix enhanced switching platform

the restructuring resulted in the overall reduction of compensation and other operating costs of the company for these years 
revenues

the decreased sales for both and were most prominent in the united states which saw a decrease in product revenues of million or from to the international sales regions also experienced decreased sales to a lesser extent from to the mix of products sold contributed significantly to the decrease in revenues in and the products acquired in the republic telcom acquisition saw a steady decrease of from to  and from to  while the netrix product utilizing the acquired technology saw a steady increase of and respectively  over the same periods 
service revenues decreased million or from to  and million or from to service revenues are primarily the result of the renewal of existing maintenance contracts as well as the negotiation of new equipment service contracts 
overall  service revenues have decreased as a result of the elimination of older product servicing which is partially offset by new product and customer contracts 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased million or from to  and decreased million or from to gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was in  in  and in the product gross margin decreased from in to in because of lower introductory pricing offered on the new product and a greater proportion of sales made through distributors  which generally have higher discounts  than direct retail sales 
product margins increased by in from as a result of higher margin product mix  and decreased in from the service gross margin was in and  and in the increase in the service margin from to was a result of decreased costs resulting from the previous years restructurings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or from to  and decreased million or from to the increase of million is the combined result of million of additional consignment inventory reserves for obsolete equipment and million of bad debt expense  partially offset by a decrease in overall expenses attributed to the restructurings discussed above 
the decrease is mainly attributed to the previous years restructuring of operations as discussed above 
marketing program expenses were also reduced significantly in  mainly in the areas of advertising  promotional programs and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million or from to  and million or from to as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses decreased from of revenues in and to of revenues in the decrease in r d expenses for and is due mainly to the restructurings discussed above general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from to  and decreased million or from to increases in professional fees and recognition of a sales tax assessment were the principal causes of the increased costs in reductions from the restructuring of operations discussed above and reduced consulting costs contributed to the lower and expenses 
interest and other  net 
net interest expense increased  from to as a result of increased borrowing in net interest expense increased  from to as a result of increased borrowing in and decreased interest income 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  the company experienced declining revenues and net losses of approximately million and million respectively  due to declining sales of the company s mature products which were partially offset by increases in sales of new products 
as a result  the company s tangible net worth decreased from million at december  to million at december  the company s line of credit agreement requires it to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million measured at the end of each month 
since october  the company has been in violation of this covenant 
this covenant violation allows the company s lending institution to call for collection of the outstanding loan balance 
as of april  the lending institution had not exercised this right 
on april  the lending institution granted the company a waiver of the current and past months covenant violations and waived its right to call the line of credit for these covenant violations 
the lending institution amended the line of credit agreement to measure the company s tangible net worth on a quarterly basis and set the minimum tangible net worth covenant at million as of march  and million for all subsequent quarters 
management believes that this new covenant will be adequate for the company to operate under in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will not violate the new covenant or that the outstanding loan balance will not be called by the lending institution upon violation of the new covenant 
the success and the future of the company is dependent on its ability to generate net income or to increase its net worth by the sale of additional equity 
the company s ability to generate net income is in large part dependent on its success at increasing sales of its new products and or controlling costs 
the company s plan to increase revenues through sales of its network exchange product line is continuing to evolve in order to exploit new markets and customer channels  however  due to market conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond its control  the company has been unable to achieve sufficient incremental growth in new product sales to replace the decline in mature product sales and there can be no assurances that the company will be able to adequately increase new product sales in the future 
the company has implemented cost control measures and is continually evaluating expense levels to generate net income and mitigate its liquidity risk 
at december   the company had approximately million of total eligible borrowing availability and approximately million outstanding under the line of credit 
at december   the company had approximately million of eligible borrowing and approximately million outstanding under the line of credit 
in august  as a result of concerns about the deterioration of aged international accounts receivable  the lending institution initiated discussions regarding the elimination of international receivables as qualified accounts receivable for borrowing collateral 
the lending institution also increased the interest rate for all outstanding loan amounts to prime plus from prime plus 
in october  a sub line of credit for selected foreign receivables up to an amount of  on selected accounts receivable 
as of december   the company s domestic accounts receivable have generated adequate borrowing for operations  and the company has not had to use the foreign sub line of credit 
at december   the company had approximately million in cash and investments compared to million at december  for the year ended december   the company used million of cash for operations 
non cash items consisting of depreciation and amortization of million contributed to the loss of million 
the reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million combined with the increase in accounts receivable of million had a negative effect on cash flow for the year 
inventory levels at december  were million lower than at december  and were million lower than at june  this reduction is the result of efforts during the last half of to bring inventories in line with current sales volume and the expected phase out of older products 
capital acquisitions during were million compared to million in  and million in these acquisitions were mostly for equipment used for research and development purposes along with some computer and test equipment 
the success of the company is dependent on its ability to generate adequate cash for operations and capital needs 
its ability to generate adequate cash for such needs is in part dependent on its success in increasing sales of its products 
the company intends to increase revenues through sales of its network exchange product line  however  due to market conditions and other factors beyond its control  there can be no assurance the company will be able to adequately increase product sales 
therefore  the company may have to generate additional cash through the sales of assets  including technologies  or the sale of debt or equity securities 
although the company believes it has the ability to generate additional cash through such sales  such sales may be dilutive and there can be no assurances that adequate funds will be available or available on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to generate adequate cash  there could be a material and adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the company 
the company has implemented cost control measures and is continually evaluating expense levels to mitigate its liquidity risk 
certain factors that may affect future results the company believes revenues will increase through sales of its network exchange products 
however  the company may have to generate additional cash through other means  which may include the sale of assets  including intellectual property and proprietary technology  the sale of equity  additional borrowings  the sale of selected operations  or one or more strategic partnerships 
although the company believes it has the ability to generate additional cash through such sales  such sales may be dilutive and there can be no assurances that adequate funds will be available  or available on terms that are reasonable or acceptable  to the company 
the lending institution amended the line of credit agreement to measure the company s tangible net worth on a quarterly basis and set the minimum tangible net worth covenant at million as of march  and million for all subsequent quarters 
management believes that this new covenant will be adequate for the company to operate under in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will not violate the new covenant or that the outstanding loan balance will not be called by the lending institution upon violation of the new covenant 
if the company is unable to generate or borrow adequate cash  there will be a material and adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the company  to the extent that a sale  liquidation or restructuring of the company will be required  in whole or in part 
future operating results may be affected by a number of other factors including the timing of new products in the market place  competitive pricing pressures and global economic conditions 
because the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  the development  introduction  and evolution of competitive products may require a significant investment of financial resources 
additionally  the company relies on reseller channels  which are not under its control for a significant portion of its revenues  particularly in its international regions 
in addition  while the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components to date  the interruption or termination of the company s current manufacturing relationships could have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity and operating results 
the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the success of the company is dependent on its ability to generate adequate cash for operations and capital needs 
its ability to generate adequate cash for such needs is in part dependent on its success in increasing sales of its products 
the company intends to increase revenues through sales of its network exchange product line  however  due to market conditions and other factors beyond its control  there can be no assurance the company will be able to adequately increase product sales 
a limited number of relatively large customer orders has accounted for and is likely to continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues in any particular fiscal period 
as a result  the timing of orders could significantly affect the company s operating results 
in any period  the unexpected loss of or decline in revenues from a major customer  or the failure to generate significant revenues from other customers  could have an adverse effect on the business and operating results of the company 
although the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenue  certain expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be adjusted in the short term 
accordingly if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s products often represent a significant capital expenditure for its customers and  for that reason  the company s operating results may vary significantly depending upon general economic conditions and customers budgetary cycles 
during  a nominal portion of the company s revenues has been derived from sales to the united states government  primarily through systems integrators 
the revenues generated by government business  which is spread across numerous agencies and departments  could be adversely affected by governmental budgetary or fiscal restraints or changes in government policy 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and changes in telecommunications services offered by public carriers 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or telecommunications services may adversely affect the company s ability to market its products 
this may require the company to make substantial expenditures on research and development in order to develop new products or to maintain the competitiveness of its existing products 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and in industry standards  to anticipate changes in market requirements and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis  will be a significant factor in the company s ability to remain competitive 
if the company is unable  for technological  financial or other reasons  to develop  introduce and successfully market products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  the company s business would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company has experienced delays in releasing certain of its products and there can be no assurance that it will not encounter technical or other difficulties that could delay the introduction or release of new products in the future 
the development and introduction of new and enhanced products requires a significant investment of financial resources 
to the extent that the company s existing financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms reasonable to the company or at all 
the market for networking systems is extremely competitive 
many of the company s competitors are more established  benefit from greater market recognition and have greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines 
an increase in competition could have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
maintaining the competitiveness of the company s products will require continued investment by the company in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make such investment or that the company will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain the competitiveness of its products 
a significant portion of the company s total revenues has been derived from international sales  and the company expects that international business will continue to represent an important element of its business 
substantially all of the company s international sales have been made through third party distributors  and in many cases the company relies upon only one distributor for a particular country 
a reduction in the sales by some or all of these distributors or a termination of their relationships with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial performance 
in addition  the company s international business may be adversely affected by changes in demand for its products resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  as well as by risks such as trade and tariff regulations  political instability  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  difficulties or delays in collecting accounts receivable and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel 
none of the company s executive officers or key employees is subject to an employment or non competition agreement 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the company relies on reseller channels  including distributors and systems integrators  for a significant portion of its revenues 
none of these resellers are under the control of the company and there can be no assurance that future sales by resellers will continue at present levels or will not decline 
the loss of one or more significant resellers could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  the company relies on resellers to provide certain limited service and support to their customers  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
certain components used in the company s products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources 
although the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components to date  the company s inability to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future  or to obtain sufficient sole source or limited source components as required  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
certain products that are or may in the future be marketed with or incorporated into the company s products are supplied by or under development by third parties 
these third parties may be the sole suppliers of such products 
the company also currently relies on a single contract manufacturer to assemble and test most of the company s products 
although a number of such contract manufacturers exist  the interruption or termination of the company s current manufacturing relationship could have a short term adverse effect on the company s business 
the inability of any such third parties to supply  develop or manufacture components or products in a timely manner or the termination of the company s relationship with any such third party could delay shipment of the company s products and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the networking industry  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by analysts or other events 
year the year presents concerns for business and consumer computing 
aside from the well known problems with the use of certain digit date formats as the year changes from to  the year is a special case leap year  and dates such as were used by certain organizations for special functions 
the problem exists for many kinds of software and hardware  including mainframes  mini computers  pcs  and embedded systems 
netrix corp has divided the year task into three areas of concern  netrix product  netrix suppliers  and netrix internal systems 
the company s core products have been reviewed  tested and if required implemented corrective measures to ensure no year issues 
this task is complete with information regarding the netrix products available via internet access and software release notes 
netrix suppliers are being asked to respond to the year issue 
this will be an ongoing process and is considered a low risk to the company 
netrix internal systems have been audited and corrective measures are being taken to correct identified year issues 
at the present time internal systems represent the largest area of concern for the company 
the internal systems category has been further broken down into hardware and software areas  business operations applications  engineering applications  unix based technologies and pc based technologies 
the company has identified all major hardware and software components that need to be assessed and has performed a preliminary assessment of all hardware and software identified 
the company has updated a majority of hardware in use and is in the process of converting all software applications that are known to have year issues 
netrix anticipates completion of software conversions by september  leaving the fourth quarter of for testing and contingency measures 
in order to ensure proper conversion of the key financial  manufacturing  and erp software  the company has engaged the main supplier of its software to assist with the conversion and implementation of the conversion 
the initial conversion of this critical system will be accomplished by june  and the final conversion for live production use in the third quarter of vendors or other third parties that could affect the company s operations include suppliers of utility services  travel and hotel services  office supply vendors  equipment and technology vendors  mail  telephone  internet and other communications services 
each of the company s departmental directors has been instructed to communicate with their major suppliers with respect to such vendors year compliance status 
all of the company s departments have been directed to make arrangements with an alternative vendor if it appears that the current vendor will not achieve compliance by the year there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems of the company s major vendors  including providers of public utilities  will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company or organization  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have an adverse effect on the company 
although the company anticipates that minimal business disruptions will occur as a result of year issues  possible consequences include loss of communications with members  inability to conduct marketing efforts and on site seminars as a result of travel and communications disruptions  delay in the production and distribution of studies and reports  inability to conduct research and surveys  and disruption of similar normal business activities 
the company believes that the conversion and modification efforts by the company and its vendors will mitigate the risks associated with year issues 
if  however  the company or its essential vendors do not complete the necessary modifications or conversions in a timely manner or if such modifications or conversions fail to achieve the proper results  the company s operations may be adversely effected 
the company does not intend to develop any contingency plans to address possible failures by the company or its vendors to the year compliant with respect to information technology systems 
the company does not believe that such contingency plans are required because it believes that the company and its information technology suppliers will be year compliant before january the company currently does not have any contingency plans to address possible failures by its vendors to be year compliant with respect to non information technology systems  but expects to develop such plans by june while year issues present a potential risk to the company s internal systems  distribution and supply chain  and facilities  the company is minimizing its risk with a concentrated effort 
the company is performing an extensive assessment and is in the process of testing and remediating mission critical components 
the current plan is to have the majority of these components identified by june  with the remaining components resolved by september management currently believes that all critical systems will be ready by january  and that the costs to address these issues will not exceed the budgeted amounts 
management estimates the cost to address and resolve year issues will approximate million  and these costs have been included in the company s operating plan for
