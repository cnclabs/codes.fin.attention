item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nce  psco and sps competition and industry outlook the business and regulatory environment in the utility industry that has existed for decades is continuing to change 
competition is increasing  particularly in energy supply and retail energy services 
several states in the us have either passed or proposed legislation that provides for retail electric competition and price deregulation of energy supply 
the wholesale electric energy market has expanded and geographic boundaries are no longer barriers 
increased activity by power marketers and traders has added new dimensions of complexity and risk 
a significant amount of electric generation assets have been purchased  sold or traded in the us during and this trend is expected to continue 
consolidation and globalization is a continuing trend as businesses position themselves for competition in an unbundled energy industry 
the company continues to look for opportunities to expand its customer base as an energy service provider and on an ongoing basis evaluates merger  acquisition and divestiture opportunities 
electric prices in the company s service territories are low in comparison to other parts of the us state legislatures and state utility commissions in the retail jurisdictions served by the company s utility subsidiaries are focusing on the restructuring and deregulation of the electric utility industry  however  no significant progress was achieved during the company supports a fair and orderly transition to a competitive environment and believes that any restructuring plans should provide the company with an opportunity to recover its costs for prudently incurred utility investments and contractual commitments that may be uneconomic in the future 
overall  the company believes that the prices its utility subsidiaries charge for electricity and the quality and reliability of their service currently place them in a position to compete effectively in the energy market 
the potential negative financial impacts of deregulation  however  could include an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins and increased costs of capital see note summary of significant accounting policies in
