the increase in cost of resort operations as a percentage of resort operating revenue from in to in reflects the start up costs of vca tucson as well as initial lower occupancy of this new property 
the increase in interest income from million in to million in is a result of the increased customer notes retained by the company and increases in interest rates charged by the company on its customer notes 
the company has sought to increase the percentage of customer notes it retains hypothecates and borrows against  rather than sells  thereby benefiting from the interest spread between the customer rate and the lower company borrowing rate 
interest expense is comparable between years in spite of greater hypothecation borrowings because of reductions in other notes payable from the proceeds of the company s follow on offering in the second quarter of cost of vacation ownership interests sold as a percentage of vacation ownership interest sales increased from in to in due to an increase in the sales mix of purpose built vca facilities  which have a higher cost basis than acquired resorts

increases in costs of generating tours in is due in part to the trial of several new marketing strategies which were determined ineffective and were therefore terminated in july and august additionally  the tempe sales office was not retained beyond the trial period april july due to high marketing costs and low closing rates 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of vacation ownership interest sales remained comparable between years 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses increased to as a percentage of total timeshare revenues in from in due to an increase in payroll expense  professional fees and rent expense

liquidity and capital resources sources of cash the company generates cash primarily from the sale of vacation ownership interests including upgrades  the financing of customer notes from such sales and resort operations 
because the company uses significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation ownership interests  but collects the cash on the customer notes receivable over a long period of time  borrowing against and or selling receivables is necessary to provide sufficient cash available to fund its normal operations 
cash provided by financing activities increased to million in from million in and from a use of cash of million in  reflecting the follow on public offering of million shares of common stock in april for proceeds net of offering costs of million 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to reduce notes payable and negotiated in excess of million in lines of credit against consumer notes receivable at favorable borrowing rates  consistent with its intent to retain more of its consumer notes receivable and borrow against such notes  thereby earning the interest spread between the consumer rate and the lower borrowing rate 
for regular federal income tax purposes  the company reports substantially all of its non factored financed vacation ownership interest sales under the installment method 
under the installment method  the company recognizes income on sales of vacation ownership interests only when cash is received by the company in the form of a down payment  as installment payments or from proceeds from the sale of the customer note 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest may be imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the related tax is paid 
if the company is otherwise not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method  as the interest expense is not estimable 
at december   the company  excluding its genesis subsidiary  had net operating loss nol carryforwards of million  which expire in through at december   genesis had federal nol carryforwards of million  which are limited as to usage  because they arise from built in losses of an acquired company 
in addition  such losses can only be utilized through the earnings of genesis and are limited to a maximum of  per year 
to the extent the entire  is not utilized in a given year  the difference may be carried forward to future years 
any unused genesis nols will expire in in addition  section of the code imposes additional limitations on the utilization of nols by a corporation following various types of ownership changes which result in more than a change in ownership of a corporation within a three year period 
such changes may result from new common stock issuances by the company or changes occurring as a result of filings with the securities and exchange commission of schedules d and g by holders of more than of the common stock  whether involving the acquisition or disposition of common stock 
if such a subsequent change occurs  the limitations of section would apply and may limit or deny the future utilization of the nol by the company  which could result in the company paying substantial additional federal and state taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of cash investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash because of capital additions and loans to customers in connection with the company s vacation ownership interest sales 
net cash used in investing activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in compared to  due to the purchase of the lap minority interest  which included a cash payment of approximately  and due to a reduction from purchases of property and equipment 
the company requires funds to finance the acquisitions of property for future resort development and to further develop the existing resorts  as well as to make capital improvements and support current operations

the company intends to build twelve additional cabins at kohl s ranch in  for which a financing commitment equal to the construction cost is in place 
customer defaults have a significant impact on cash available to the company from financing customer notes receivables in that notes which are more than to days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  the company in effect must repay borrowings against such notes or buy back such notes if they were sold with recourse 
credit facilities and capital at december   the company had agreements with a financial institution for commitments totaling million under which the company could sell certain of its customer notes 
in march  the company entered into a new agreement which increased the commitment amount to million  reduced the purchase rate and expanded the scope to include customer notes generated from sales of vacation ownership interests in additional ilx properties and premiere vacation club 
the agreements provide for sales on a recourse basis with a percentage of the amount sold held back by the respective financial institution as additional collateral 
customer notes may be sold at discounts or premiums to the principal amount in order to yield the consumer market rate  as defined by the financial institution 
at december   million of the million in commitments was available to the company 
the company also has financing commitments aggregating million whereby the company may borrow against notes receivable pledged as collateral 
these borrowings bear interest at a rate of prime plus to prime plus and expire at various dates from through at december   approximately million is available under these commitments 
in april  the company sold  through a public offering   shares of its common stock at a price of  everen securities  inc  the underwriter of the offering  also exercised its overallotment option and purchased an additional  shares at a price of  for total proceeds of  proceeds of the offering  net of the costs of the underwriting including a underwriting discount  professional fees  printing and promotional costs totaling  were used to reduce debt and for working capital 
in the future  the company may negotiate additional credit facilities  issue corporate debt  issue equity securities  or any combination of the above 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  may bear interest at fixed or variable rates of interest  and may be subject to such terms as management deems prudent 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional corporate debt or equity at or beyond current levels or that the company will be able to maintain its current level of debt 
the company believes available borrowing capacity  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity  operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
other in june  the company acquired  one week  year right to use vacation ownership interests to be constructed on land adjacent to a full service resort in san carlos  mexico 
such vacation ownership interests were contributed to the company s premiere vacation club in exchange for participation in the profits of premiere vacation club as provided in the agreement 
in january  the vacation ownership interests were annexed into premiere vacation club  with premiere vacation club members having the right to use the full service resort pending completion of construction 
seasonality the company s revenues are moderately seasonal with the volume of ilx owners  hotel guests and vacation ownership interest exchange participants typically greatest in the second and third fiscal quarters 
as the company expands into new markets and geographic locations it may experience increased or additional seasonality dynamics which may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate 
year issues the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
the company believes it has identified all significant applications that will require modifications to ensure year compliance 
internal and external resources are currently being used to test year compliance and make any additional modifications where required 
the identification of needed modifications and upgrades of all significant internal applications was complete at december  in addition  the company is communicating with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year compliance issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
since the company commenced its assessment of its year compliance during early  it has expended approximately  and estimates additional future costs of approximately  consisting primarily of software purchases and associated training and consulting services 
in addition  certain employees of the company have devoted their time to assessing and implementing the company s year compliance  the costs of which have not been separately allocated by the company 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan in the event that any of its systems or the systems of any third party with which it has a material relationship are not year compliant  and expects to have the plan complete by august  in the event that the company is vulnerable to any such year compliance issue  the worst case scenario could include any or all of the following inability to timely collect payments on customer notes  inability to timely or properly bill customers for resort charges  reduction in effectiveness of generating tours to sales offices  inability to purchase goods including food  beverages and operating supplies from existing sources  thereby forcing the company to use alternative vendors at potentially less favorable pricing  inability to process payroll and or perform other accounting functions on an efficient basis  and suspension of some or all operations 
inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenues  operating income and net income during any of the company s three most recent fiscal years 
however  to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be affected as well as the rates the company charges on its customer notes
