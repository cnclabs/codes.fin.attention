item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of operations consolidated operations continuing operations consolidated revenues from continuing operations in were million  an increase of as compared to the previous year 
this improvement was the result of increases in all business segments 
consolidated revenues in were million  or higher than this increase was predominantly the result of comsat international ci revenue growth as compared to operating income from continuing operations in was million  which was million below the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a million impairment loss related to belcom a ci company operating in russia and the commonwealth of independent states and increased losses in ci of million  which were primarily related to operations in brazil 
in addition  results included million of costs related to the proposed merger with lockheed martin corporation 
improvements in operating income in both the comsat mobile communications cmc and comsat world systems cws segments totaling million partially offset those items 
operating income from continuing operations for was million  as compared to million for the decline in operating income was primarily the result of lower operating income in the cws  cmc and comsat laboratories labs segments  partially offset by improvements in ci 
the decrease in cws was primarily the result of a lower investment base in cws  which reduced operating income under rate of return regulation 
the decrease in cmc was due to increased depreciation from new satellites 
the decrease in the labs was due to the non recurrence in of the positive impact in of a licensing agreement that resolved a patent infringement dispute 
expenses of million for a proxy contest and related litigation  which were settled in the second quarter of  also affected operating income 
other income expense  net for was income of million  which was million better than this was primarily the result of a million gain from the sale of a portion of ci s investment in viatel  inc and income of million from an agreement with ico global communications holdings limited ico that settled a dispute between the corporation and ico 
see note to the financial statements 
in addition  included a million non cash write off of the labs investment in superconducting core technologies that partially offset those items 
for  other income expense  net was income of million  which was million better than this was primarily attributable to a million gain on the sale of the corporation s clarksburg  maryland property and improvements in the results of ci s equity investments 
interest costs  net of amounts capitalized for  were million  or million lower than the lower interest costs were due to the reversal of million of previously accrued interest costs related to income taxes discussed below in income tax expense and lower borrowings as a result of the use of the proceeds from the sale of comsat rsi  inc crsi to reduce debt 
lower amounts of interest capitalized due to the completion of satellites under construction partially offset these decreases 
interest costs  net of amounts capitalized for  were million  which was million higher than the increase primarily reflected reduced interest capitalized as compared to income from continuing operations before taxes and extraordinary item for was million  or million below the previous year 
this decrease was principally due to the impairment loss related to belcom  increased losses in brazil  merger costs and the non recurrence of the gain on the sale of the clarksburg property 
the gain from the sale of viatel stock and improvements in both cmc and cws partially offset those items 
income from continuing operations before taxes and extraordinary item for was million  or million below this was primarily the result of the factors noted above in the discussion of operating income  partially offset by the gain on the sale of the clarksburg property 
income tax expense for was million  compared to million for the previous year 
in the third quarter of  the corporation favorably resolved a state tax audit and  accordingly  reversed previously accrued interest costs of million and state income taxes of million 
in addition  events during the third quarter led the corporation to determine that previously accrued interest costs of million and federal income taxes of million related to certain federal tax matters were no longer required 
see note to the financial statements 
excluding these tax benefits  the corporation s effective tax rate was higher than the previous year as a result of not being able to tax benefit the belcom impairment loss and certain merger costs 
income tax expense in of million was million below this was primarily due to a decrease in income before taxes and an improved effective tax rate due principally to a reduction in state income tax expense 
income for from continuing operations before extraordinary item was million  or million below the previous year 
income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for was million  as compared to million in basic earnings per share for continuing operations before extraordinary item for were  or below for  basic earnings per share were  as compared to for diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for were  a decrease from diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for and were and  respectively

the satellite services business unit consists of two segments cws and cmc 
the corporation s other business units  ci and labs  are being reported as separate segments 
the corporation evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on income loss before taxes and interest costs 
see note to the financial statements 
in the corporation s form q reports and the form k  operating results were presented in two segments satellite services and network services 
the satellite services segment included cws and cmc 
the network services segment included ci  labs and government programs

cws provides satellite capacity for telephone  data  internet  video and audio communications services between the united states and the rest of the world using the global satellite networks of the international telecommunications satellite organization intelsat and new skies satellites nv new skies 
cws also includes the operating results of comsat government systems  inc  comsat digital teleport  inc and comsat general corporation  which provide various satellite and ground segment services to commercial and government customers 
cmc provides satellite telecommunications services for maritime  aeronautical and land mobile applications  primarily using international mobile satellite organization inmarsat satellites 
comsat is the statutorily designated us participant in both the intelsat and inmarsat satellite systems 
revenues in the satellites services business in were million  an increase of over for  satellite services revenues were million  or below the previous year 
income before taxes for the satellite services business in was million  which was better than income before taxes for satellite services in was million  a decline of as compared to world systems revenues in cws for were million  which was higher than the improvement in revenues was primarily the result of increased demand for private data communication networks and internet transmissions  partially offset by declines in voice and video revenues 
cws revenues for were million  or below the decline resulted from lower full time voice and fiber optic restoration revenues  which were partially offset by increased revenues from private data communication network leases and internet traffic 
the lower voice revenues stemmed primarily from rate reductions provided to at t  mci and sprint  cws s three largest international carrier customers 
income before taxes for cws in was million  or higher than the previous year 
the results include income of million from a settlement with ico pursuant to which the corporation will transfer operation of ico s satellite access node facility in the united states to ico 
see note to the financial statements 
the balance of the improvement in income before taxes was primarily due to higher revenues offset  in part  by increased depreciation from placing new satellites in service 
for  cws s income before taxes was million  or below the results reflect increased depreciation from placing new intelsat satellites in service 
on november   intelsat transferred six satellites five currently in orbit and one scheduled to be launched during to new skies 
new skies is an independent company that was spun off from intelsat and is headquartered in the netherlands 
see note to the financial statements and management s discussion and analysis md a outlook 
mobile communications revenues in cmc for were million  an increase of compared to last year 
in  cmc recorded increased revenues from the contract with the federal aviation administration faa on the wide area augmentation system waas and from traffic improvements in both digital telephone services and aeronautical services 
offsetting these improvements were lower sales of planet terminals and a decrease in telex revenues 
for  cmc s revenues were million  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the higher revenues were primarily the result of sales of planet terminals and service  the start of the faa waas contract and increased revenues from the inmarsat system 
cmc s income before taxes for was million  which was better than the improvement in income was primarily the result of lower operating costs offset  in part  by increased depreciation from the full year impact of new inmarsat satellites placed in service 
income before taxes for cmc in was million  which was below the decrease was primarily the result of increased depreciation associated with new inmarsat satellites placed in service during and increased costs related to planet service  which began commercial operation in comsat international ci operates an integrated group of telecommunications companies that are engaged principally in providing individualized digital network solutions and value added services to business clients and carriers in selected emerging markets 
as of december   ci operated in countries worldwide 
ci s revenues in were million  or higher than in the higher revenues were principally due to growth in argentina  brazil and colombia 
in  ci s revenues were million  which was better than the previous year 
the increase in revenues in ci was driven primarily by improvements in ci s operations in brazil  argentina and venezuela 
ci s loss before taxes in was million  as compared to losses of million in in the third quarter of  ci recorded a non cash impairment loss of million  which was related to the write down of long lived belcom assets  namely goodwill and plant and equipment 
see note to the financial statements 
in addition  ci had a million gain from the sale of viatel stock 
exclusive of the belcom impairment and the gain on the sale of stock  ci s losses increased million as compared to the increased operating losses were primarily due to higher depreciation  fixed asset adjustments and contract losses in brazil  increased losses in belcom  and start up costs in mexico 
in  the loss before taxes was million  a million improvement over the improvement was primarily the result of a decrease in losses at belcom 
comsat laboratories comsat laboratories provides technical consulting services and develops advanced communications technologies and products for satellite access and networking applications 
the labs revenues for were million  which was higher than this increase was due to improvements in technical consulting revenues 
revenues in were million  as compared to million for included in revenues and income before taxes was million related to a licensing agreement that resolved patent infringement disputes with certain manufacturers of television encryption and decryption equipment  which did not reoccur in exclusive of the revenues related to this agreement  the labs revenues were at approximately the same level as the loss before taxes in for the labs was million  compared to million in the loss included the first quarter non cash million write off of the labs investment in superconducting core technologies  inc the loss before taxes of million compared to a million profit before tax for the results included the million of income related to the agreement on patent disputes 
outlook many of the statements that follow are forward looking and relate to anticipated future events and operating results 
statements that look forward in time are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which may be affected by subsequent developments and business conditions  and necessarily involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements and the corporation s future operating results may be affected by the timing and outcome of regulatory and other governmental proceedings  legislative actions  developments concerning the privatizations of intelsat and inmarsat  the proposed acquisition of comsat by lockheed martin corporation  international and domestic business conditions  increased competition from other satellite services providers  the disposition of assets and completion of contracts placed in discontinued operations  the effect of the year issue on comsat  litigation and other factors 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual future results will not differ materially from anticipated results 
although the corporation has attempted to identify some of the important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  those factors should not be viewed as the only factors that may affect future operating results 
business combination with lockheed martin on september   comsat entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with lockheed martin corporation lockheed martin and deneb corporation acquisition sub  a wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin 
under the terms of the merger agreement  lockheed martin will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock  no par value  of comsat the comsat common stock in a two step transaction 
on september   a wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin  regulus  llc purchaser  initiated a tender offer to purchase up to subject to certain adjustments of the comsat common stock at a price of per share in cash 
the tender offer is being made pursuant to the merger agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchaser s offer to purchase  dated september  the offer to purchase  and the related letter of transmittal which  together with the offer to purchase  constitute the offer 
certain significant conditions to the consummation of the offer include i there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the offer at least one third of the comsat common stock  ii the approval by comsat shareholders of the merger described below and the merger agreement  and iii the receipt of all required regulatory consents and approvals  including the purchaser having been authorized by the fcc to acquire up to of the then outstanding shares  subject to certain adjustments such authorization  and certain related fcc authorizations  the authorized carrier conditions  and expiration of all waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws 
the purchaser s obligation to consummate the offer also is subject to there not being any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect as defined in the merger agreement on comsat or a decline in the standard poor s index of at least from the date of the merger agreement through certain specified measurement dates 
the offer is currently scheduled to expire on may  under the merger agreement  however  lockheed martin has agreed to extend the offer  for periods of no more than days  until the earlier of i september   or ii business days after the date on which the last of the authorized carrier conditions shall have been obtained 
at lockheed martin s request  the merger and merger agreement will be considered for approval by comsat s shareholders at the corporation s annual meeting of shareholders scheduled for june  the merger agreement provides that as soon as practical after consummation of the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein  comsat will be merged with acquisition sub the merger 
in the merger  each share of comsat common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger other than shares of comsat common stock held by comsat  purchaser or lockheed martin and dissenting shares  if any will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock  par value per share  of lockheed martin the lockheed martin common stock  after adjustment to give effect to a for stock split by lockheed martin effective december  and subject to possible further adjustment as provided in the merger agreement 
certain significant conditions to the consummation of the merger include i the consummation of the offer  ii the amendment of the communications satellite act of the satellite act  and iii the receipt of the approvals of the fcc and other governmental authorities required for the consummation of the merger 
in addition  the obligations of lockheed martin and acquisition sub to consummate the merger are subject to there not being any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect as defined in the merger agreement on comsat 
on january   representative tom bliley  chairman of the house committee on commerce  and senator conrad burns  chairman of the senate commerce subcommittee on communications  sent a letter to william e 
kennard  chairman of the fcc  urging the fcc not to take any action to permit any company including lockheed martin and the purchaser to purchase more than percent of comsat prior to congress adopting satellite reform legislation 
if the fcc  in deference to the position expressed in the letter  does not proceed with its review of lockheed martin s filings related to the offer  or if the fcc s review does not otherwise proceed on the schedule lockheed martin anticipated  the offer may not be completed in the first half of  the time frame previously disclosed by lockheed martin and comsat as the time frame during which they expected the offer to close 
further  if the fcc were to delay or slow its review  and if congress does not make rapid progress on satellite reform legislation  the offer may not be completed by september  if this occurs  under the terms of the merger agreement  either party may terminate the merger agreement 
the parties may also elect not to avail themselves of that right or may elect to amend the merger agreement to extend this date 
if congress enacts legislation promptly  the merger may be accelerated from the year end date previously estimated by lockheed martin and comsat as the date by which they expected the merger to close 
conversely  if the legislative process moves slowly  the merger is unlikely to occur by year end 
for information about recently introduced satellite reform legislation  see legislative and regulatory developments below 
no assurance can be given that the requisite legislation will be enacted 
if legislation enabling the merger is enacted  fcc approval of the merger in addition to the authorized carrier conditions will still be required 
while it is expected that the fcc would act promptly on the matter following enactment of enabling legislation  the fcc s response time could affect the estimated time frame for closing the merger 
in connection with the execution of the merger agreement  the parties entered into certain ancillary agreements  including a shareholders agreement  a registration rights agreement and a carrier acquisition agreement 
see note to the financial statements for a description of those agreements 
restructuring of intelsat and inmarsat significant progress was made during and early with respect to the corporation s ongoing efforts to restructure intelsat and inmarsat 
on november   intelsat transferred six satellites five currently in orbit and one scheduled to be launched during to new skies satellites nv new skies 
new skies  which is headquartered in the netherlands  is an entirely separate  independent company spun off from intelsat 
prior to the transfer from intelsat to new skies of the six satellites  the financial results related to those satellites were included in intelsat s financial statements 
since the corporation uses the proportionate method of accounting to account for its investment in intelsat  a portion of the financial results related to those satellites also was included in the corporation s financial results 
comsat is using the cost method of accounting for its investment in new skies 
comsat s direct ownership of new skies is approximately 
under the cost method  comsat will recognize income only at the time dividends from new skies are received 
comsat does not anticipate that new skies will declare dividends during and for some period of time thereafter 
during  the corporation s share of pre tax earnings related to the satellites transferred to new skies was approximately million 
as a result  cws s pre tax earnings will be lower by approximately this amount in the absence of other factors that may affect operating results in cws 
comsat continues to consolidate the remaining intelsat investment and recognizes its portion of intelsat s results of operations each reporting period 
see note to the financial statements 
in june  the fcc issued a public notice requiring us earth stations licensees using intelsat satellites that were scheduled to be transferred to new skies to file license modification applications by july  in order to access the new skies system 
several companies  including comsat  filed applications in response to this notice 
in september  a competitor of new skies filed a petition asking the fcc to deny the applications or alternatively to grant the applicants special temporary authority to access new skies for a limited period and to defer the question of permanent authority to a later date 
comsat  new skies  and several of the applicants opposed this petition 
the fcc did grant special temporary authority to access new skies following the november  asset transfer and indicated that it would act on the question of permanent authority once it had obtained a complete record 
the corporation expects that such authority ultimately will be granted 
at its meeting in december  the intelsat board of governors continued its discussions on transforming the remaining portion of intelsat from a treaty based  intergovernmental organization to a fully private company 
the intelsat board of governors will continue this work at its meeting in march it is the corporation s objective to privatize the remaining portion of intelsat by the end of the corporation  as a minority shareholder and the us signatory to intelsat  lacks the ability to independently effect a restructuring of intelsat 
the success of the corporation s efforts will depend on its ability to achieve a consensus among other signatories and participating member governments 
a two thirds vote of the governments that are members of intelsat would be necessary for approval of any final privatization proposal 
in september  the inmarsat assembly of parties approved a plan to transfer the operating assets of the current inmarsat intergovernmental organization to a new company 
inmarsat is expected to become an independent commercial company  based in the united kingdom  in april while the new company initially would not be publicly traded  it is expected that it would proceed with an initial public offering within approximately months after its creation 
individual ownership in the new company would be capped at  although comsat s ownership in inmarsat at the time of privatization would be grandfathered 
comsat s ownership of inmarsat was as of december  comsat s voting rights  however  would be capped at with respect to votes against certain shareholder resolutions 
prior to the public offering  owners are expected to be able to trade shares  and strategic investors may invest up to million in equity in the new company 
comsat signed the relevant inmarsat restructuring agreements in february as a result  upon the transfer of inmarsat s assets to the new company  comsat will be able to exercise its shareholder rights  as described in the preceding paragraph  and will continue to provide its current mobile satellite communications services using the satellites of the inmarsat successor company 
as with intelsat  comsat currently consolidates its shares of the accounts of inmarsat 
at the time of inmarsat s privatization  the corporation will begin using the equity method of accounting for its investment in the new company 
under the equity method  the corporation would include its proportionate share of the new company s operating results as part of the corporation s operating results 
currently  inmarsat does not recognize income taxes in its financial results 
the successor company to inmarsat will be subject to income taxation in the jurisdiction in which it operates  the united kingdom 
in and prior years  the corporation reported its proportionate share of inmarsat s operating results in revenues  operating expenses and other income expense 
as a result of the privatization of inmarsat  the corporation expects to report in its share of inmarsat s operating results  net of uk taxes  in other income expense 
the corporation does not anticipate that its use of the equity method of accounting for inmarsat s results will affect its net operating results 
the following table illustrates the effect of adoption of the equity method of accounting for the corporation s investment in inmarsat on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
the as reported column reflects summary historical financial information for the corporation as of december  the proforma column reflects similar summary unaudited proforma financial information assuming the equity method had been adopted as of december  the proforma information reflected is based upon the historical portion of inmarsat s financial information included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as of december  in preparing the proforma consolidated balance sheet  the corporation s share of inmarsat s assets and liabilities were removed from the respective financial captions eg  property and equipment or long term debt and reclassified as an investment in inmarsat in the consolidated balance sheet 
the proforma financial data is intended for informational and illustrative purposes only and should not be viewed as indicative of the future financial condition of the corporation on a consolidated basis 
in millions unaudited as of december  as reported proforma assets current assets property and equipment  investments other total   liabilities and stockholders equity current liabilities long term debt non current liabilities preferred securities issued by subsidiary stockholders equity total   regulatory and legislative developments on april   the fcc granted the corporation s petition for reclassification as a non dominant common carrier in markets that currently represent over of cws s revenues for intelsat services 
for those markets  rate of return regulation was lifted immediately 
on february   the fcc eliminated comsat s remaining rate of return regulation along thin routes in favor of comsat s incentive based pricing plan 
that plan will lower prices for customers on thin routes and  at the same time  ease the regulatory burden on the corporation in connection with its intelsat business 
the fcc also adopted a procedure for reclassifying thin routes as competition increases to make them eligible for non dominant treatment 
the fcc s april  non dominant order also granted the corporation s request to file tariffs for thick route services on one day s notice with a presumption of lawfulness  tariffs for thin route services must be filed on days notice but require only minimal cost support 
the non dominant order also granted the corporation s request for the elimination of the cws structural separation requirements and gave cws authority to enter the earth station market on an unseparated and non dominant basis 
on october   the fcc issued a separate notice of proposed rulemaking that looks toward enabling users to have direct access to the intelsat system  which would end comsat s status as the exclusive provider of intelsat services in the united states 
in the direct access notice  the fcc tentatively concluded  among other things  that it lacks the statutory authority to impose level direct access by which users could invest and acquire an ownership interest in intelsat but does have the authority to require level direct access by which users could contract directly with intelsat for capacity and bypass comsat 
the fcc sought comments on its tentative conclusion that it would serve the public interest to mandate level direct access 
the corporation filed comments contesting the basis for the fcc s proposed action 
the imposition of direct access could have a substantial adverse impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation  however  does not believe that the fcc has the current authority to grant direct access under the satellite act and would vigorously contest the exercise of such authority by the fcc 
in october  congress passed  and the president subsequently signed  the international anti bribery act of the act provides that as of may   an international organization providing commercial satellite services will not be accorded immunity from suit or legal process in connection with its provision of such service  except as required by international agreements to which the united states is a party that are so designated by the president 
the act requires the president to designate those agreements which are subject to the exception and directs the president to take all appropriate actions to reduce or eliminate all privileges and immunities that are not preserved by designation 
the corporation opposed prior versions of this legislation but supported it in the form ultimately passed by congress 
the corporation does not believe that enactment of this legislation will have a material effect on its business  because i inmarsat is expected to be privatized before may   and ii the president is expected to designate the intelsat headquarters agreement an international agreement to which the united states is a party  thereby requiring the united states to continue to afford intelsat immunity from suit and legal process under the act 
the president has since delegated this designation authority to the secretary of state 
on february   senator conrad burns  chairman of the senate commerce subcommittee on communications  introduced the open market reorganization for the betterment of international telecommunications orbit act s 

comsat believes that s 
 on the whole  represents a constructive approach to the privatization of intelsat and regulation of the corporation 
significantly  s 
would repeal the ownership restrictions on comsat stock upon enactment and eliminate other outdated provisions in the satellite act 
the bill would not interfere with the ongoing privatization of inmarsat  which is expected to be completed in april the corporation does have concerns with some provisions of the bill  including the target for full intelsat privatization and a requirement that the president withdraw the us from this international organization if this privatization goal is not achieved 
although the corporation believes privatization of intelsat will be completed rapidly  united states withdrawal from intelsat in  if privatization is not completed  would have a substantial adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the house of representatives is also expected to consider satellite privatization issues this year  most likely in the form of legislation being prepared by representative tom bliley  chairman of the house committee on commerce 
at this time  representative bliley s timetable for revising and re introducing his satellite bill passed by the house in the last congress  which was entitled communications satellite competition and privatization act of hr  is unclear 
the corporation opposed hr because it contained provisions that  in the view of the corporation s management  would adversely affect the corporation s results of operations and the value of its shareholders investments in the intelsat and inmarsat satellite systems 
the clinton administration opposed hr in testimony before the senate commerce committee late last year 
world systems cws continues to be well positioned through its long term agreements with major international carriers to provide cost competitive services for bulk usage beyond the year in addition  cws expects revenue growth from the provision of services in emerging markets  including the internet  international vsat  asynchronous transfer mode atm and link one technology 
cws also expects to face increasing competition over the longer term from existing competitors and new market entrants including new skies 
intelsat currently has five intelsat ix satellites on order 
it is expected that they will be launched during to during  intelsat successfully completed the placement in orbit of the remaining two intelsat viii satellites 
two of the six intelsat viii satellites were a part of the transfer of satellites to new skies 
the new intelsat viii series satellites offer higher power c band capabilities to address various markets 
mobile communications cmc plans to continue to expand its service offerings and value added products to meet anticipated growth in customers needs 
the increasing numbers of digital terminals with improved operating efficiency and reduced service charges are expected to make possible traffic growth in land mobile  small commercial and pleasure boat  and business traveler markets 
cmc expects to continue to face increasing competition from existing inmarsat service providers  other wireless communications services including c band  low earth orbit satellite systems such as iridium and other potential market entrants 
comsat international ci operates an integrated group of telecommunications companies that are engaged principally in providing individualized digital network solutions to business clients and carriers in selected emerging markets 
ci also plans to develop prospective international telecommunications opportunities that are consistent with its digital networking strategy 
in this regard  ci will continue to target those rapidly growing markets where a significant number of ci s existing or targeted clients are located or in which they intend to locate 
on january   in response to increasing capital flight  the brazilian government widened the controlled trading band on its currency  the real 
this created an initial devaluation of over compared to the us dollar 
as support for the currency continued to diminish  it was apparent that the brazilian government needed to allow a free float  which occurred shortly thereafter 
as a result  the brazilian real was devalued over compared to the us dollar  and is no longer tied to a fixed trading range 
it is expected that the continued instability of the real  as well as the current economic climate within brazil  will negatively impact growth and financial performance during in ci s operation in brazil 
in  comsat brazil was ci s largest operating company  accounting for approximately of ci s revenues 
in addition  brazil s problems could have the potential for a spill over effect into other latin american markets in which ci has operations 
ci faces certain operational risks inherent to the countries in which it operates 
these risks are typical of emerging markets and include changes in government regulations and licensing requirements  tariffs  taxes  sanctions and other trade barriers  exchange controls  bureaucratic impediments  political  social and economic instability  inflation  devaluation  interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that the current economic difficulties faced in asia  russia  brazil and elsewhere  or any future economic difficulties  or any other risks enumerated above or otherwise  will not adversely impact ci s existing or prospective customers  thereby affecting ci s ability to generate revenues or otherwise having a material adverse affect on ci s financial results and condition 
year issue year readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of existing computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year ie  for 
certain of the corporation s computer programs that have date sensitive software may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  to the extent that this situation exists  there is the potential for system failure or miscalculations  which could cause a disruption of operations 
the problem is not limited to computer programs  as some of the corporation s computer and other operational equipment that have date sensitive processors may not be able to process dates after december  in the second half of  the corporation initiated a program to identify and properly address issues associated with the year problem in order to avoid interruption to the corporation s operations at the turn of the century 
each of the operating segments of the corporation  as well as the administrative functions  has completed the inventory and assessment phase of the year implementation plan and is currently implementing plans to remediate the non compliant systems identified during these first two phases 
the corporation presently believes that such changes to the corporation s key computer and other operational systems and equipment will be completed and tested by the end of the third quarter of the corporation s current estimate is that it will cost approximately million prior to january  to modify its in house management information systems  customer products and other systems and equipment affected by the year issue 
of this amount  the corporation has spent million  or approximately of the projected amount  through december  year modifications and replacements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which were derived using assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of resources and the reliability of third party modification plans 
future events that might cause material differences in management s current expectations and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel with appropriate skills  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  reliance on third parties and similar uncertainties 
while the corporation is devoting substantial resources to its own year compliance effort  comsat  as well as other international telecommunications carriers  will be dependent  in part  on foreign and other third party telecommunications carriers being year compliant 
the financial impact on cws and cmc of foreign or third party telecommunications carriers failing to meet the year challenge would be realized in either of two ways loss of revenue due to the inability to complete the up link or down link transmissions to or from a satellite and or loss of the corporation s share of intelsat and inmarsat revenues 
in recognition of the financial exposure resulting from this dependency on foreign and third party telecommunications carriers  the corporation has undertaken  as part of its year efforts  an analysis of the year compliance efforts of these telecommunications carriers 
in addition to this analysis  the corporation is also utilizing the results of efforts undertaken by the international telecommunication union itu 
the corporation plans to develop contingency plans to deal with this issue depending on the results of its analysis and the year readiness status of individual telecommunications carriers 
cws derives in excess of of its revenues under long term contracts 
almost all of these revenues are dependent upon termination with a foreign telecommunication carrier
