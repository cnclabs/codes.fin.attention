the slight improvement over fiscal is attributed to selected menu price adjustments which occurred during january  the implementation of software in the restaurants which allowed management to identify and react to product usage variances  and the company s ability to anticipate and react to fluctuations in food costs  in particular  increases in its dairy costs  and to offer or promote alternative inventory items or menu selections in response to such fluctuations 
the cost of restaurant sales generally consists of the cost of food  beverages  freight  and paper and plastic goods used in food preparation and carry out orders 
labor and other related expenses were of restaurant sales for fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher wage rates outside of the state of florida as well as increased staffing at the manager levels to meet planned expansion 
the company had four restaurant locations formerly chi chi s which were expected to open in the third quarter of fiscal which did not open until the fourth quarter due to unanticipated legal complications involved in the completion of the acquisitions 
as a result  the company paid additional salaries and related expenses in the third quarter for management and other personnel awaiting assignment to these new restaurants without receipt of offsetting revenues from those stores

pre opening expenses were of revenues for fiscal as compared with for fiscal the in fiscal is exclusive of the one time charge of  net of income tax benefit  related to the company s early adoption of a new accounting standard which requires that pre opening and other start up costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
the increases for fiscal exclusive of the one time charge were attributed to the ten units that were opened in fiscal as compared with nine units opened during fiscal provision for impaired assets was  or of revenues for fiscal in the fourth quarter  the company recorded the pre tax charge relating to the write down of impaired assets to their estimated fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

although at the current time the company intends to continue operating this restaurant  it has not  nor is it projected to  contribute positively to the company s cash flow in the foreseeable future

the income tax expense benefit improved from an expense of of revenues to a benefit of of revenues in fiscal the fluctuation was attributed to the reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset  thereby providing a  benefit during fiscal to offset the provision for income taxes 
the company carried the valuation allowance until fiscal due to the uncertainty of its taxable income upon multiple state expansion 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in the company recognizing a  pre tax charge   net of income tax benefits  relating to the write off of pre opening costs 
this change resulted from the early adoption of a new accounting standard  statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that pre opening and other start up costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
the adoption has been made effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
as a result of the adoption  the company will begin reporting pre opening costs as incurred  which in turn will result in lower future amortization expense 
since the company has amortized pre opening costs over a one year period following the opening of its restaurants  the impact of the accounting change is not expected to materially affect the company s future net operating results  although the quarterly fluctuations may be magnified based upon the timing of restaurant openings 
the net income decreased  to  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal fiscal versus fiscal total revenues increased by between fiscal and fiscal most of the year to year increase was attributable to new restaurant openings coupled with increases in same store sales of for fiscal the company opened nine restaurants during fiscal as compared with new restaurants during fiscal  nine of which opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal the increases in same store sales were attributable to increases in the number of customers served resulting from expanded advertising and remodeling of certain restaurants  and to a lesser extent from menu price adjustments

the company believes that cash flows from operations coupled with the funds available from anticipated third party financing and cash balances at january   will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
the company s expansion strategy is dependent upon achieving projected cash flow from operations and to a lesser extent  obtaining third party financing 
third party financing may include  but is not limited to  traditional lending sources such as bank lines of credit  equipment leasing  and or restaurant sale leaseback arrangements that may be available to the company 
the company from time to time may utilize third party financing as necessary to facilitate expansion 
in the event that the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate due to unanticipated expenses or construction or other delays or difficulties or otherwise  projected cash flow or third party financing otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund operations and fully implement the company s expansion strategy  the company could be required to seek additional financing from sources not currently anticipated or reduce its expansion plans 
there can be no assurance that third party financing will be available to the company when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
the company has  of principal indebtedness due in which is expected to be repaid out of the company s cash flow from operations 
quarterly fluctuation of financial results the restaurant industry in general is seasonal  depending on restaurant location and the type of food served 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarter to quarter operating results due to its high concentration of restaurants in florida 
business in florida is influenced by seasonality due to various factors which include but are not limited to weather conditions in florida relative to other areas of the us and the health of florida s economy in general and the tourism industry in particular 
the company s restaurant sales are generally highest from january through april and june through august  the peaks of the florida tourism season  and generally lower from september through mid december 
in many cases  locations are in coastal cities  where sales are significantly dependent on tourism and its seasonality patterns 
it is anticipated that implementation of the company s expansion program into the midwest markets will  over time  reduce some of the existing seasonal fluctuations 
in addition  quarterly results have been  and in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings both in and outside of florida 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter are not generally indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year on an annualized basis and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
year issue the year compliance software issues will affect the company as well as most other companies 
historically  certain computer programs and certain microprocessors were designed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  software programs may recognize a date using the two digits as rather than the year computer programs that do not recognize the proper date could generate erroneous data or cause systems to fail 
the company has established a year task force to analyze the company s year compliance 
the year project covers both the store level systems as well as the corporate systems 
the various phases of the project include identification of systems  assessment of year exposure  validation  implementation  and contingency planning 
based on its assessment of its major information technology systems  the company expects that all necessary modifications and or replacements will be completed in a timely manner to insure that each of its systems are year compliant 
the company has incurred approximately  of year project expenses through january  future expenses are expected to approximate  as the company s current hardware systems and software  with minor modifications  have been represented by their vendors to be either year compliant or have a year compliant upgrade available at no charge 
the company s year project also considers the readiness of significant vendors 
the company believes that if certain vendors were not year compliant  then alternate arrangements could be made that would alleviate any material impact on operations 
the contingency plans for material systems such as general ledger  payroll  fixed assets  and cash management systems involve manual workarounds and extra staffing 
the contingency plans for distribution or vendor related issues entail alternative suppliers and distributors 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting its critical suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company intends to change suppliers to those who have demonstrated year readiness 
the company can give no assurances that the responses it receives will be accurate  or if changes are necessary  that the company will be successful in finding such compliant suppliers and service providers 
the company currently has formal information concerning the year status of most of its major suppliers and service providers 
the company will continue to contact and assess year readiness of its suppliers and vendors 
achieving year compliance is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify all aspects of its business that are subject to year problems of suppliers that affect the company s business 
there can also be no assurance that the company s software vendors are correct in their assertions that the software is year compliant  or that the company s estimate of the costs of systems preparation for year compliance will prove ultimately to be accurate 
should either the company s internal systems or internal systems of one or more significant suppliers fails to achieve year compliance  or the company s estimate of the costs of becoming year compliant prove to be materially inaccurate  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
impact of inflation and price changes the company has not operated in a highly inflationary period and its management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or expenses 
as expenses increase  the company expects to recover increased costs by increasing prices  to the extent permitted by competition or by modifying its menu and promoting other less cost sensitive products 
due to the fact that the company s business is somewhat dependent on tourism in florida  any significant decrease in tourism due to inflation would likely have a material adverse effect on revenues and profitability 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 acounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is gains and losses depends upon the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not evaluated the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements
