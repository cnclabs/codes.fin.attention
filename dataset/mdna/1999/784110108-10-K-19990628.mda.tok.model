impact of inflation increases in the inflation rate are not expected to materially affect the company s operating results 
inflationary cost increases have not been material in recent years  and to the extent allowed in light of competitive pressures  such increases are passed on to customers through increased billing rates 
foreign currency translation the overall effects of foreign currency exchange rates on the company s business during the periods discussed have not been material 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates create a degree of risk to the company s operations if those movements affect the dollar value of costs incurred in foreign currencies 
substantially all of the company s billings to date have been denominated in us dollars 
changing currency exchange rates may affect the company s competitive position if exchange rate changes impact profitability and business and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors

year considerations the year problem refers to the inability of many existing computer systems to completely or accurately process information or logic involving the year and beyond 
the problem results from the use of two digit date fields to perform computations and decision making functions in many computer systems 
for example  a program using a two digit date field may misinterpret as the year rather than date dependent programs are ubiquitous in computer systems used in many critical business operations 
unless these programs are remediated to address the year problem  many mission critical programs may fail or produce erroneous data or results 
the company has established a formal program to address any potential year compliance issues relating to its internal operating systems  products  distributors  resellers and vendors 
the company has reviewed all of its major internal operating systems and is continuing to monitor any new additions to its internal operating systems for year compliance 
substantially all of the company s internally developed products have been designed and tested to satisfy the company s year specifications 
the company is currently reviewing the status of its distributors  resellers and vendors regarding year compliance 
the company believes that the risk of disruption of the company s operations due to the year problem is minimal 
however  the company relies upon various third party organizations for basic services such as electrical power  telecommunications  postage and delivery  banking  and other infrastructure services 
in a worst case scenario  the company could suffer adverse consequences as a result of interruption of some or all of these services 
these third party dependencies are not unique to the company or to companies in its industry or geographical location 
disruptions in these infrastructure services would likely have a negative impact on most business enterprises 
the company is currently developing specific contingency plans to operate during such disruptions in infrastructure services 
the cost of the company s year compliance program is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or liquidity 
to date  the company has not incurred significant costs with respect to its year compliance efforts  and anticipates that total expenses will not exceed  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material adverse consequences in the event that the company s year compliance program is not successful  or its distributors  resellers or vendors are unable to resolve their year compliance issues in a timely manner
