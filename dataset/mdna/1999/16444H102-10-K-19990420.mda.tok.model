year compliance the year issue is a result of computer programs being written using two digits  eg  to define a year 
date sensitive software may recognize the year as the year rather than the year this would result in errors and miscalculations or even system failure causing disruptions in everyday business activities and transactions 
software is termed year compliant when it is capable of performing transactions correctly in the year because the company s primary business is marketing and licensing its trademarks  the company has only modest information technology requirements and resources  none of which is critical to the company s day to day operations 
based on a recent assessment of the company s computer hardware and software  it has been determined that more than of the company s hardware and software systems are either currently year compliant or have an existing upgrade available from the software vendor that is year compliant 
all systems that are not currently year compliant will either be upgraded to be year compliant or replaced with alternative systems that are year compliant over the next eight months 
the company expects the costs to upgrade or replace such systems will not exceed approximately  the company does not expect that the achievement of year compliance by the company will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely effected if its significant licensees fail to adequately address and correct year problems and such failures result in the interruption of royalty payments or lower royalty payments 
the company has no control over its licensees year compliance and as a result the company cannot develop a contingency plan to respond to any material failures by its licensees to achieve year compliance 
the company has contacted its most significant licensees in an effort to determine the status of their year compliance efforts 
the company has received information that these licensees have evaluated the impact  assessed the potential problems of year and they are currently taking steps to be in compliance in a timely manner 
notwithstanding  there can be no assurance that the company s significant licensees will be year compliant in a timely manner  and as discussed above  their failure to do so could materially adversely effect the company new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is the type of hedge transaction 
the new rules will be effective the first quarter of the company does not believe that the new standard will have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the company is not involved in derivative instruments and hedging activities
