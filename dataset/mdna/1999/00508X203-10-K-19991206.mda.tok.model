the electronics segment is the previous enclosure products and systems group plus mclean thermal management and eder industries 
the industrial segment combines the remaining elements of the former engineered solutions group with the tools and supplies businesses 
prior period segment information has been restated to reflect the realignment of the business segments 
in september  the company announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives relating to the industrial segment  including a possible sale of the segment 
these alternatives with the industrial group would enable the company and its shareholders to focus on the strong potential of the electronics segment 
sale of the industrial segment is conditional on any potential transaction meeting structural and valuation criteria and would be subject to normal required approvals

cti  which manufactures custom backplanes  was integrated with apw s electronic solutions business unit 
both innovative and cti are included in the electronics segment 
also in the fourth quarter  a wholly owned subsidiary of apw purchased for the industrial segment  shares of ergun kriko san ticaret ergun  an akhisar  turkey based company specializing in the manufacture of hydraulic cab tilting systems and hydraulic bottle jacks for the turkish truck market 
the total purchase price of the combined innovative  cti and ergun acquisitions totaled approximately million  including fees and expenses 
on september   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  apw enclosure systems limited  accepted for payment all shares of rubicon group plc rubicon common stock which had been tendered pursuant to the apw enclosure systems limited tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock at pounds sterling per share and all outstanding shares of cumulative preferred stock at pounds sterling per share  which constituted control  which resulted in the acquisition of the remaining outstanding common shares 
rubicon is a leading provider of electronic manufacturing services and engineered magnetic solutions to major oems in the information technology and telecommunication industries 
consideration for the transaction totaled approximately million  including related fees and expenses 
apw enclosure systems limited obtained all of the funds it expended from the company 
to provide the necessary funds  the company and enerpac bv  a netherlands subsidiary of the company  as borrowers  entered into a multicurrency credit agreement  dated as of october   providing for an million  five year revolving credit facility the new facility 
in conjunction with the closing of the new facility  the company terminated its prior million  five year revolving credit facility the facility  and used certain funds received under the new facility to repay borrowings under the facility 
on july   the company completed its merger with zero corporation zero  a leading supplier of electrical and electronic system enclosure products and thermal management products 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock in exchange for all outstanding common stock of zero corporation and assumed outstanding options to purchase zero common stock that were converted into options to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger

net sales and net income for zero for the period april  through august  which results are not included in the historical combined results were million and million  respectively 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation  including  but not limited to  the reclassification of previously reported segment data into the newly formed industrial and electronics business segments 
net sales net sales increased during fiscal to  million from  million in fiscal in aggregate  acquired businesses contributed million in sales growth in fiscal fiscal net sales increased over fiscal acquisitions contributed approximately million of the fiscal sales increase 
price changes have not had a significant impact on the comparability of net sales during the last three years 
percentage change sales from prior year segment sales millions electronics  industrial total   electronics fiscal sales increased million  or  over fiscal the acquisition of rubicon  and innovative in fiscal and inclusion of a full year sales of the vero  aa manufacturing  pmp  pti  premier and brown locations acquired in fiscal contributed million in sales to the electronics segment in fiscal exclusive of acquisitions and the adverse impact of the strong dollar on reported sales  electronics sales increased in fiscal fiscal electronics sales growth resulted from the continued expansion of the size  territory and content of the segment s enclosure product lines  partially offset by lower thermal management product sales as these lines were refocused on the higher growth telecommunications market 
fiscal sales in the electronics group  excluding acquisitions and net of the negative impact of the stronger us dollar  grew primarily as a result of the continued expansion of end user electronics markets in the us and europe 
industrial sales increased in fiscal and increased absent the effect of currency translation and acquired businesses 
strong growth in the sale of recreational vehicle slide outs and leveling systems in north america and of automotive convertible top and truck lines in europe contributed to the sales gain but were partially offset by asia related weakness at enerpac 
fiscal industrial sales grew  as acquisitions  notably the november versa tek acquisition  contributed million of the sales growth 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and of foreign exchange  fiscal industrial group sales increased  due primarily to strength in the european truck and automotive product sales 
the industrial segment s fiscal sales comparisons will be affected by the anticipated first quarter fiscal sale of two product lines  rubicon magnets and zero s samuel groves kitchenware product line  which had combined fiscal sales approximating million  but minimal operating profit contribution 
percentage change from sales prior year geographic sales millions north america  europe japan and asia pacific latin america total   the company does business in many different geographic regions and is subject to various and diverse economic conditions 
fiscal north american sales grew due primarily to acquisitions made in the prior fiscal year and internal growth of 
an improved economic environment in north america and the effect of acquisitions combined to increase fiscal north american sales over european sales volume in fiscal more than doubled due primarily to the september acquisition of rubicon and a full year of sales for the vero businesses acquired in fiscal  both of which are concentrated in the uk and continental europe 
european sales grew in fiscal compared to the combination of the vero acquisition  which contributed million  along with strong internal growth accounted for fiscal growth 
sales in japan and asia pacific declined and in fiscal and  respectively  due primarily to the general economic malaise in this region 
in  sales decreased in japan and asia pacific  of which was attributable to foreign currency fluctuations 
the remaining decrease was caused by weakening economic conditions 
sales in latin america decreased in fiscal  attributable to the weakening economic climate in this region during the year 
sales growth generated in latin america during and was the result of geographic expansion in this region 
as the company s recent acquisition strategy has focused on north america and europe  sales from japan  asia pacific and latin america are expected to become a smaller percentage of the company s future total sales 
gross profit gross profit increased in fiscal to million compared to million  exclusive of one time charges  in fiscal in fiscal year  gross profit increased also from million in fiscal year the increases in gross profit dollars were primarily a result of the above discussed increases in sales volume 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales has declined over the last two years  primarily reflecting an increased proportion of lower margin electronic enclosure and integration revenue in the sales mix  partially offset by the success of cost reduction and productivity enhancing measures in the industrial group 
fiscal gross profit included one time charges of million related to the decision to discontinue certain product lines and stock keeping units sku s  primarily in the industrial segment  and  to a lesser extent  charges within the electronics group to conform zero inventory valuation methods to the company s 
gross profit percentages by segment electronics industrial total fiscal gross profit percentages exclude one time charges of million 
inclusive of such charges  fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales were  and for the electronics segment  industrial segment and total company  respectively 
electronics gross profit as a percentage of sales has declined in each of the last two years  reflecting the group s aggressive move from primarily technical environments into lower margin electronic enclosures via acquisitions in and and the acquisition of the rubicon electronic integration business in early fiscal the company believes that the electronic enclosure and integration markets offer the company significant growth opportunities albeit at a lower gross margin  partially offset by lower selling  administrative and engineering expenses relative to sales  than the group s historic average 
the industrial group s gross profit relative to sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of increased emphasis on more profitable product lines and cost control and manufacturing productivity initiatives 
the slight decline in industrial gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a higher proportion of sales to lower margin oem customers 
engineering  selling and administrative expenses sae sae as a percent of sales electronics industrial total including corporate sae sae as a percent of sales in fiscal exclude a one time loss resulting from a contract termination of million 
inclusive of the contract termination charge  fiscal sae as a percent of sales were and for the industrial segment and total company  respectively 
fiscal sae percentages exclude one time charges of million 
inclusive of such charges  fiscal sae as a percent of sales were  and for the electronics segment  industrial segment and total company  respectively 
fiscal sae of million increased million  or  over the prior year  exclusive of prior year one time charges 
fiscal sae included a one time  pretax contract termination charge of million 
as a percentage of sales  sae exclusive of one time charges declined to in fiscal from and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the fiscal and declines in sae expense as a percent of sales were due primarily to acquisitions of electronic enclosure and electronic integration businesses  which have a lower ratio of sae to sales  combined with cost reduction initiatives  primarily within the industrial segment 
it is the company s goal to continually identify ways to be more cost efficient  allowing the company to reduce operating costs as a percent of sales 
in addition to variable selling expenses  sae has increased as a result of acquisitions  product development programs and expenditures to support expansion of the electronics group and geographic expansion into emerging markets 
fiscal sae included million relating to a number of initiatives  including the zero merger and headquarters closing  rationalization of the company s electronics segment s manufacturing facilities and infrastructure  and the consolidation of certain support functions in the industrial segment 
the company s fiscal restructuring initiatives are further described below in this management discussion and analysis portion of this form k 
amortization of intangible assets amortization percentage change expense from prior year millions electronics industrial total fiscal amortization expense in the industrial segment excludes one time charges of million relating to the write down of goodwill at locations in germany and mexico in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
inclusive of such charges  fiscal amortization expense was million and million in the industrial segment and total company  respectively 
the fiscal increase in amortization expense was primarily a result of the electronics segment s acquisition of rubicon in september and a full year of amortization expense for acquisitions completed during fiscal the fiscal increase in amortization expense resulted from the acquisition of vero  brown manufacturing company  premier industries  product technology  inc  aa manufacturing  inc 
and performance manufactured products  inc 
in the electronics segment and of versa technologies  nylo flex manufacturing company  del city wire co  inc and ancor products  inc 
in the industrial segment during the fiscal year  combined with a full year of amortization expense on hormann security systems limited and c fab group limited which were acquired by the electronics segment during fiscal the company expects that amortization expense  exclusive of the effect of future acquisitions  will approximate million in fiscal merger  restructuring and other non recurring items in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded restructuring and other one time charges of million  or per diluted share  after tax 
the pre tax charges of million related to costs associated with the zero merger  various plant consolidations principally associated with the electronics businesses  and other cost reductions and product rationalization efforts of the company 
the pre tax charges of million included million for severance payments for a reduction of approximately employees  of which a negligible amount was paid in fiscal  and million in zero merger costs 
with the exception of approximately million in reserves relating primarily to long term lease commitments and other contractual obligations  no accrued restructuring reserves remained at august  the following table summarizes the manner in which merger  restructuring and other non recurring items were recorded in the company s fiscal income statement 
year ended august  merger  restructuring other non recurring items electronics industrial corporate consolidated millions cost of products sold engineering  selling and administrative expense amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges merger related expenses operating earnings with respect to rationalization of the electronics segment  it is the company s strategy to become the premier  global electronic enclosure manufacturer 
in line with that strategy  the company completed eleven electronic enclosure acquisitions in fiscal and  operating facilities in countries at august  as a result of the company s rapid expansion into the electronic enclosure business  there were significant rationalization and integration opportunities within and between the acquired businesses 
in late fiscal  the company formalized a plan to eliminate redundancies and streamline operations within these acquired businesses 
these rationalization efforts include consolidating three facilities into one in the northeastern united states  the consolidation of production of several product lines between facilities  standardization of design and development functions  and other organizational realignments 
as a result of this plan  the company recorded million for related charges  including provisions for costs associated with employee severance  the closing of facilities and write off of discontinued inventory 
the company completed the planned reorganization of its electronics segment in fiscal also in late fiscal  the company initiated aggressive programs  spanning both business segments  to eliminate or reduce product lines and items which were not generating sufficient economic return 
the programs include the elimination of slow moving or marginal products and the entire exit of less productive product lines 
as a result of these programs  the company recorded a one time million charge to cost of products sold for the write down of discontinued or obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value 
the company s product line initiatives were materially completed by the end of fiscal lastly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted a plan to consolidate the headquarters functions of the enerpac and gardner bender divisions of the industrial segment into a single headquarters in glendale  wisconsin and plans to reorganize and to combine certain north american and european facilities of the company s engineered solutions segment 
as a result of these initiatives  the company recorded charges of million relating primarily to employee severance payments  facility closure costs  operating lease obligations and  in two cases the write down of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for further information on the write down of goodwill  see note a summary of significant accounting policies 
the company completed its industrial segment reorganization in fiscal in addition to the million charge  fiscal results also included a pretax million asset impairment charge recorded to reduce a european subsidiary of zero in the industrial segment to estimated net realizable value 
the assets of this european subsidiary are expected to be sold in the first quarter of fiscal any gain or loss on such sale is not expected to be material 
net sales and operating earnings included in the consolidated statement of earnings attributable to this subsidiary were not material to fiscal results 
other expense income millions net financing costs other net the fiscal increase in net financing costs was primarily the result of borrowings to finance the acquisition of vero and rubicon and the march issuance of million of fixed rate  subordinated debt 
the fiscal increase was attributable to borrowings to finance acquisitions during this period

income tax expense the company s effective income tax rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was largely impacted by the current non deductibility of the one time charges recorded in the fourth quarter 
excluding the one time items  the effective income tax rate was 
the non deductibility of goodwill on many of the company s acquisitions over the last three years has led to the gradual increase in the company s effective tax rate  a trend which is expected to continue in cash flow in order to minimize interest expense  the company intentionally maintains low cash balances and uses available cash to reduce short term bank borrowings 
cash and cash equivalents increased million in fiscal as compared to a decrease of million in fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal outstanding debt totaled million  million and million at august of each of fiscal  and  respectively 
net borrowings in both fiscal and primarily reflect incremental borrowings to fund acquisitions 
net cash provided by operations  after considering non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities  totaled million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from a higher level of earnings before non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal over fiscal was also a result of increased operating earnings before non cash charges  combined with a million reduction in working capital 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal uses for investing included for acquisitions  primarily rubicon  and a million use for capital expenditures  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of assets 
fiscal included uses of million to fund acquisitions and million to fund capital expenditures 
investing activities in fiscal included million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
financing activities provided net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net borrowings in each period primarily reflected increased debt incurred to fund acquisitions and million and million in fiscal and  respectively  in proceeds from the financing of trade receivables 
additionally  in fiscal  the company used million of cash to fund the obligations of two zero employee benefit programs as a result of the company s merger with zero 
liquidity and capital resources in order to minimize interest expense  the company intentionally maintains low cash balances and uses available cash to reduce short term bank borrowings 
funds available under unused non committed lines and the million multi currency credit agreement totaled million as of august  during the next several years  a significant portion of the company s cash flow is expected to be used to fund business acquisitions  to fund capital expenditures and to service indebtedness 
capital expenditures are currently anticipated to approximate million in fiscal and to decline to a lower level per year thereafter 
such expenditures will be made to upgrade and expand the company s manufacturing facilities  primarily within the electronics segment 
the company periodically reviews electronic  industrial and other businesses for potential investment  consistent with its strategic objectives 
management intends that any acquisition which requires significant funding would be financed using the company s bank lines and  depending upon market conditions  the company s common stock 
the company believes that availability under its bank lines  plus funds generated from operations  will be adequate to fund operating activities  including capital expenditures and working capital  for the next fiscal year 
the following table summarizes the company s total capitalization over the last three years percentage of total dollars capitalization total capitalization million total debt shareholders equity deferred income taxes totals  outstanding debt at august  totaled million  an increase of million since the beginning of fiscal the fiscal increase in debt was a direct result of the september rubicon acquisition  partially offset by million in net debt repayment in the latter half of fiscal end of year debt to total capital was on august   on august  and on august  the company s interest coverage ratio in fiscal years  and was x  x and x  respectively

in conjunction with the closing of the new facility  the company terminated its prior million  five year revolving credit facility the facility  and used certain funds received under the new facility to repay borrowings under the facility 
previously  on june   the company and enerpac bv  a netherlands subsidiary of the company  entered into a multicurrency credit agreement the credit agreement  providing for a million  five year revolving credit facility the facility in order to provide the necessary funds to applied power limited to acquire all of the vero group plc shares

to reduce risk of interest rate increases  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert million of the company s variable rate debt to a weighted average fixed rate of at august  the swap agreements expire on varying dates through the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that an entity recognize derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
by one year 
as a result  sfas no 
will be effective for the company s fiscal year 
adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company based on its current derivative and hedging activities 
year considerations as is the case for most companies  the year computer issue creates a risk for the company 
if the company s systems  including both information technology it and other systems which may include embedded technology and micro controllers  do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has taken action intended to ensure that its computer systems are capable of processing periods for the year and beyond 
the company has developed and has clearly articulated a written policy that year readiness is an important responsibility for all its business leaders 
in addition  the company is aggressively pursuing a comprehensive set of programs intended to reduce the risk of disruptions due to the year problem 
the company s year plans are designed and monitored centrally but managed and executed on a local level at each of the company s more than facilities 
the company s year programs have been executed in four phases as described below phase awareness during this phase  the company designed its year programs  assigned responsibility for the effort  educated the organization regarding year risk and prepared and distributed a comprehensive inventory review template 
phase inventory and compliance review this phase included compilation of an inventory of internal and external systems and risk factors 
the internal factor inventory included office  financial  business and manufacturing systems and items which might include embedded chip technology 
the inventory of external factors included identification and survey of critical vendors 
the compliance status of each inventoried system was documented during this phase 
local findings were verified by a combination of independently trained internal and external year reviewers 
phase remediation and contingency planning for each system identified as not being year ready in phase  a remediation or contingency plan was developed 
the remediation plan could include system elimination  replacement  upgrade or the addition of a software patch 
contingency plans were also developed to address exposure related to critical third party vendor systems 
with respect to third party year exposure  contingency plans could include alternative sourcing  increasing inventory levels or otherwise reducing the company s exposure to the third party system 
phase testing the final phase of the program involves testing the year readiness of all critical it and non it systems 
programs conducted during this phase include comprehensive testing of business systems by rolling forward the system clocks to test a number of potential problem dates  the testing of embedded chip technology in critical manufacturing systems  the testing of electronic data interchange with customers and year readiness audits of critical third parties 
the company has completed the first three phases of its year programs and substantially completed the final testing phase around the end of fiscal at this time  the company believes that it has taken all reasonable steps necessary to prepare for the year however  it is impossible for the company to identify the potential impact and all related costs and consequences of the potential year failure by third parties  particularly those that have either not responded  or incompletely responded  to inquiries by the company as to year readiness 
based on the current status of the company s readiness efforts  the costs associated with identified year issues are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
many of the company s business units have installed new business management systems which go beyond just year readiness 
the costs of purchased software and implementation of that software are capitalized 
some businesses chose to upgrade existing systems to be compliant 
these costs were being expensed as incurred to the extent the upgrades did not provide additional functionality 
the company does not believe that its year programs have resulted in the deferral of other it programs 
the company historically has not quantified the costs of year readiness and remediation  but believes costs incurred to date were not material to the company s financial position 
the company estimates fiscal costs  including internal costs such as payroll expenses incurred for the year project  ranged between million and million  and were funded with cash flow from operations 
at this time  the company does not expect the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the year problem to have material adverse effects on the company s business  operations or financial condition 
however  the company cannot be certain that it will not suffer business interruptions  either due to its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible to fulfill their commitments to the company 
furthermore  the year problem has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be reasonably foreseeable  and there can be no assurances that every material year problem will be identified and addressed or that unforeseen consequences will not arise and possibly have a material adverse effect on the company 
unanticipated factors while implementing the changes necessary to mitigate year problems  including  but not limited to  the ability to locate and correct all relevant codes in computer and imbedded systems  or the failure of critical third parties to communicate and mitigate their year problems  could result in unanticipated adverse impacts on the business activities or operations of the company 
european economic monetary union on january   eleven of the european union countries including eight countries where apw operations are located adopted the euro as their single currency  resulting in fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
following the introduction of the euro  the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries during the transition through january  beginning on january   the european central bank will issue euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy bills and coins and use the euro as their legal currency 
the company s various operating units located in europe which are affected by the euro conversion intend to maintain their books in their respective legacy currency through a portion of the three year introductory period 
at this time  the company does not expect the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the ongoing euro conversion to have material adverse effects on the company s business  operations or financial condition 
inflation no meaningful measures of inflation are available because the company has a significant number of small operations which operate in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
outlook was a significant year for applied power in terms of financial performance and the strategic repositioning of the company 
the industrial segment s results reflected the benefit of a wide array of new product and operational improvement projects apw has undertaken over the last few years 
the company anticipates continued improvement in industrial during fiscal during the last three years  however  applied power has been investing preferentially in its electronics business segment 
electronics  at slightly over billion in sales  is the most vertically integrated and largest electronic enclosure company in the world 
the market for products and services of the type offered by electronics is estimated at over billion  and growing 
the second quarter of was the first full quarter that included the results of the three major acquisitions made in calendar year the results apw reported for its fiscal third and fourth quarters  relative to the second quarter results  indicate that the company s electronics strategy yielding benefits in sales and associated earnings growth 
apw expects that fiscal  allowing for seasonal fluctuation  will continue to demonstrate the unique value creation opportunity which is intrinsic in its leading position in the high growth  expansive electronics market 
given apw s confidence in the future of the electronics segment  the company recently announced a decision to explore the sale of industrial 
the proposed sale of industrial would allow the company to focus all of its energy and capital towards the electronics opportunity 
this decision  if implemented  would complete the transition of applied power in four years from being a pure industrial market business to a pure electronics market company 
the company believes that these initiatives will enhance shareholder value 
sale of the industrial segment is conditional on any potential transaction meeting structural and valuation criteria and would be subject to normal required approvals 
risk factors that may affect future results certain statements in this form k  including the above section entitled outlook  as well as statements in other company communications  which are not historical facts  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the terms anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  objective  plan  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such statements  factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include  without limitation  general economic conditions and market conditions in the industrial production  trucking  construction  aerospace  automotive  recreational vehicle  computer  semiconductor  telecommunication  electronic and defense industries in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  asia  market acceptance of existing and new products  successful integration of acquisitions  competitive pricing  foreign currency risk  interest rate risk  unforeseen costs or consequences of year issues  the company s ability to access capital markets  successful disposition of the industrial business  and other factors that may be referred to in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission from time to time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note a summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note g debt 
currency risk the company has significant international operations 
in most instances  the company s products are produced at manufacturing facilities located near the customer 
as a result  significant volumes of finished goods are manufactured in countries for sale into those markets 
for goods purchased from other company affiliates  the company denominates the transaction in the functional currency of the producing operation 
the company has adopted the following guidelines to manage its foreign exchange exposures i increase the predictability of costs associated with goods whose purchase price is not denominated in the functional currency of the buyer  ii minimize the cost of hedging through the use of naturally offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  netting  pooling  and iii where possible  sell product in the functional currency of the producing operation 
the company s identifiable foreign exchange exposures result primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers along with the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company identifies naturally occurring offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
the company s financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables  receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk the company enters into interest rate swaps to stabilize financing costs by minimizing the effect of potential interest rate increases on floating rate debt in a rising interest rate environment 
under these agreements  the company contracts with a counter party to exchange the difference between a fixed rate and a floating rate applied to the notional amount of the swap 
the company s existing swap contracts range between two and seven years in duration 
the differential to be paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized in net income as an adjustment to interest expense 
credit and market risk is minimized through diversification among counter parties with high credit ratings 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for steel 
therefore  the company has established a program for centralized negotiation of steel prices 
this program allows the company to take advantage of economies of scale as well as to cap pricing 
all business units are able to purchase steel under this arrangement 
in general  the contracts lock steel pricing for months and enable the company to pay less if market prices fall
