additional factors affecting future operating results ace comm provides products to a technology driven industry sector 
therefore  ace comm s success is dependent in part upon factors beyond its control 
this report contains forward looking statements relating to the prospective operating results of the company 
the following are factors  in addition to those set forth in selected quarterly financial data  and year  which could affect ace comm s future operating results 
these factors are intended to serve as a cautionary statement to statements that may be made  either verbally or in writing  including those in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
to date  a significant portion of the company s revenue has been derived from substantial orders placed by large organizations 
the company expects that in the future it will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers in any given period for a significant portion of its revenue 
the company s future success may depend upon the continued demand by such customer for its products and services 
in addition  in fiscal  management believes that its customers capital spending decisions will be affected by the diversion of resources to year issues and to related changes in their internal operations 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellation of orders 
the company s business is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry  in the united states and internationally  on the continued convergence of voice and data networks and on the evolution and widespread adoption of emerging network technologies 
any decline in the growth of the industry  the failure of these markets to converge or the failure of these network technologies to evolve or achieve widespread market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a key element of the company s business strategy is to develop strategic alliances with leading companies that provide telecommunications services or that manufacture and market network equipment in order to expand the company s distribution channels and enter new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase the number of  or to expand  these types of relationships  in order to market its products effectively  particularly internationally  or that it will successfully develop other sales and marketing strategies 
the company s growth has placed significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support continued growth of the company s operations 
if the company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  the quality of its products and services and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the new and emerging carrier market in the united states and overseas represents a source of growing demand for the company s products  software licenses and services 
in that this market segment is relatively new and in that many of these organizations are in the early stages of their development  financial resources may be limited and may adversely affect their ability to pay for the company s products  software licenses and services 
trade receivables subject the company to the potential for credit risk with customers in the telecommunication services industry and government sector 
approximately of the company s gross trade receivables balances was represented by five customers at june  to reduce credit risk  the company conducts ongoing evaluations of its customers and requires letters of credit or other pre payment arrangements  as appropriate 
the company maintains accounts receivable allowances to provide for potential credit losses 
however there can be no assurances that one or more customers will not be unable or unwilling to pay its or their obligations to the company and in such event the company s cash flows and financial results would be adversely affected 
the company derived approximately million  or of its total revenues  from customers outside of the united states in the company anticipates that a significant amount of future revenues will be derived from sales to end users in asia  europe and other areas of the world 
these revenues may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions in foreign countries  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ability to successfully develop new  and enhance existing  products  to service its customers  and to remain competitive depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
year the company develops and markets hardware and software products which i collect call record data for use in customer billing  customer care  network surveillance  alarm processing and network management and ii automate certain of such network operation and management functions 
the company s products are incorporated in systems used by post  telephone and telegraph companies  telephone and wireless carriers  and large enterprises 
the company s products must be able to process date dependent data correctly 
the year problem refers to the limitations in the programming code of certain existing software programs which limit the ability of such programs to accurately produce or process date sensitive information for the year and beyond 
in the case of the company s products  unless the relevant software programs are modified prior to december   the supply by an end user s system of inaccurate date sensitive data such as call records or inaccuracies in the company s software including third party operating system software could cause the company s products to provide erroneous or inaccurate output data to its customers for billing  network management  etc 
certain of the company s installed products are the subject of warranties or of maintenance contracts under which the company agrees to modify products to accurately process date sensitive information  including dates at and beyond january  the company has completed testing of its current products including component parts supplied by third parties for year compliance  using the definition of year conformity requirements developed by the british standards institute 
the company has notified customers that older products may require modification to become year compliant and is offering maintenance contracts to provide such modifications for a fee 
customers who have elected not to purchase an extended maintenance contract and want the company s product to be year compliant must procure the year upgrade for a fee 
most  but not all  customers have entered into such maintenance or upgrade contracts 
the company plans to complete upgrading all customers who are currently under customer support contracts by september  the company has completed an assessment of the risks and costs associated with the year issue on internal hardware and software 
the company is in the process of implementing systems changes and expects this process to be completed for all critical systems by september  the company is in the process of obtaining an assessment of its non information technology systems eg elevators  hvac contained in facilities that the company leases from others 
the cost of addressing the company s year issues has not been fully quantified 
the company expenses such costs as incurred 
management is not aware of any year compliance exposures which would preclude ongoing operations during the next twelve months or which would result in material short term cash requirements 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the year problem if it or third parties fail to successfully address this issue 
in particular  if customers fail to modify their systems such as to supply accurate data  their systems could be significantly disrupted and claims against the company could result 
in addition  if customers fail to purchase year upgrades or maintenance contracts  or if the company s upgrades or modifications are inadequate  the company may experience significant liability  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
these and other year related problems which may be encountered by the company s strategic partners and customers could have a material adverse effect on the company  through the impact of litigation or the loss of business 
in addition  in the event that the company s internal systems are not compliant  the company could experience considerable delays in customer service  sales and collections and in compiling sales and financial information and performing other administrative functions 
the company may have to expend more resources than is currently anticipated to resolve year issues and such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address the situation that may result if the company or third parties are unable to achieve year compliance for its critical operations
