all amounts and percentages are approximations 
overview american safety is a specialty insurance holding company which  through its subsidiaries  develops  underwrites  manages and markets primary casualty insurance and reinsurance programs in the alternative insurance market for i environmental remediation risks  ii employee leasing and staffing industry risks  and iii other specialty risks 
the company s specialty insurance programs include coverages for general liability  pollution liability  professional liability  workers compensation and surety  as well as custom designed risk management programs including captive and rent a captive programs  for contractors  consultants and other businesses and property owners who are involved with environmental remediation  employee leasing and staffing  and other specialty risks 
through its us brokerage and management services subsidiaries  the company also provides specialized insurance program development  underwriting  risk placement  reinsurance  program management  brokerage  loss control  claims administration and marketing services 
the company insures and places risks through its us insurance subsidiary  as well as its non subsidiary risk retention group affiliate and substantial unaffiliated insurance and reinsurance companies 
the company also reinsures and places  through its bermuda reinsurance subsidiary and substantial unaffiliated reinsurers  a portion of the risks underwritten directly by its us insurance subsidiary  its risk retention group affiliate and other insurers 
substantially all of the reinsurance business that the company currently assumes is for primary insurance programs that the company has developed and underwritten 
the company is able to select its roles as program developer  primary underwriter  reinsurer  program manager and broker based on its assessment of each risk profile 
after determining its roles  the company utilizes its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  its insurance brokerage and management services subsidiaries  and a risk retention group affiliate to generate risk premium revenues  program management fees  insurance and reinsurance commissions and investment income  as appropriate 
the company s general  pollution  professional liability  and surety other than bail bonds lines of business are written primarily for environmental remediation contractors  consultants and property owners involved with environmental risks 
environmental remediation contractors are involved in the removal or abatement of hazardous materials and conditions such as asbestos  lead  underground storage tanks and other environmental risks 
environmental consultants and similar professional firms engage in the detection and analysis of hazardous materials and the design and monitoring of remediation projects 
the general  pollution  and professional liability policies written and reinsured by the company are issued for specific environmental remediation risks  have limited rather than absolute pollution exclusions and contain aggregate limits of liability 
the company s workers compensation line of business is written primarily for environmental industry businesses and the employee leasing and staffing industry 
the workers compensation coverage for contractors involved in environmental remediation includes coverage for risks which may include occupational diseases from exposure to hazardous substances 
surety bonds issued by the company guarantee the performance of environmental and other contractors on environmental remediation and construction projects  and the payment of sums due to laborers  materialmen and suppliers 
the company s revenues are comprised of risk premium revenues  program management fees  insurance and reinsurance brokerage commissions  investment income  interest on secured notes receivable  net realized gains from the sale of investment securities  and other income 
the company s primary revenue source has been reinsurance assumed from its us insurance subsidiary  its risk retention group affiliate and other insurers  for which the company has developed specialty insurance programs 
the company and its risk retention group affiliate write only casualty coverages and therefore do not participate in reinsuring first party property coverages 
the company s development and structuring of programs are focused primarily on the generation of revenues and earnings  whether attributable to underwriting profits  fees  commissions  or a combination of these items 
for example  a profitable program may be structured to result in break even underwriting results in the company s insurance subsidiaries  while at the same time creating revenues and earnings in the company s program management or insurance brokerage subsidiaries 
the company s financial position and results of operations are subject to change based on various factors  including competitive conditions in the insurance industry  unpredictable developments in loss trends  changes in loss reserves  market acceptance of new coverages and enhancements  and changes in levels of general business activity and economic conditions 
during this decade  the company has operated in a soft market cycle which is characterized by excess insurance capacity and declining insurance premium rates 
combined ratio the combined ratio of an insurance company measures only the underwriting results of insurance operations and not the profitability of the overall company 
the company s reported combined ratio for its insurance operations may not provide an accurate indication of the company s overall profitability from insurance and reinsurance programs due to the exclusion of fee and commission income and expenses generated in related management and agency subsidiaries 
depending on the company s mix of business going forward  the combined ratio may fluctuate from time to time and may not reflect the overall profitability of insurance programs to the company 
reserves certain of the company s insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation risks  as well as workers compensation policies  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
the company engages an independent internationally recognized actuarial consulting firm to provide reserve studies  opinions and rate studies 
reserves are estimates at a given time  which are established from actuarial and statistical projections by the company of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims occurring on or prior to such time  including claims that have not yet been reported to the insurer 
the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not materially exceed the company s reserves 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company  together with consulting outside vendors  has reviewed its information technology systems ie  underwriting  insureds  claims and accounting and believes that the systems will process date information accurately and without interruption when required to process dates in the year and beyond 
in the context of year issues  the company has identified the following general categories of business partners as material to the company s ability to conduct its operations software  hardware and telecommunication providers  banks and investment managers  insurance brokers  agents and producers  reinsurers and reinsurance intermediaries and utilities 
the company has been in contact with its material business partners to determine their state of readiness with regard to year compliance and the potential impact on the company 
based on the information available to the company  the company has not currently identified a material business partner that will not be compliant with respect to year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that such material business partners will be year compliant  and such noncompliance could have a material affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has conducted a review of its underwriting guidelines and policies  and has determined that the insurance policies issued by the company did not insure year claims 
however  changing social and legal trends may create unintended coverage for claims by reinterpreting insurance contracts and exclusions 
it is impossible to predict what  if any  exposure insurance companies may ultimately have for year claims whether coverage for the issue was specifically excluded or included 
the company anticipates that its information technology systems will be year compliant on or before june  the company s contingency plan for any year noncompliance of its information technology systems involves the manual entering and outputting of business records 
the company believes it has sufficient employees and other staff available to maintain its current level of customer service 
to date  the company has spent less than  on hardware and software relating to year compliance and the company does not anticipate any significant additional expenditures with respect to the year issue

in workers compensation insurance  annual premium payments are generally determined on the basis of the insured company s payroll 
at the start of a policy year  the level of payroll is unknown and must be estimated 
the insured then pays workers compensation premiums based on this estimate of future payroll 
at policy expiration  an audit is performed to determine the insured s actual payroll for the policy period 
then  the actual payroll is compared to the original estimate  and either an additional workers compensation premium is billed or a return premium is refunded

liquidity and capital resources the company historically has met its cash requirements and financed its growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
the company s primary sources of cash flow are proceeds from the sale or maturity of invested assets  premiums earned  investment income  commission income and management fees 
the company s short term cash requirements are primarily for claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits and other operating expenses  and the purchase of investment securities  which have historically been satisfied from operating cash flows 
due to the uncertainty regarding settlement of unpaid claims  the long term liquidity requirements of the company may vary  and the company has attempted to structure its investment portfolio to take into account the historical payout patterns 
management believes that the company s current cash flows are sufficient for its short term needs and the company s invested assets are sufficient for its long term needs 
the company also purchases reinsurance to mitigate the effect of large claims and to help stabilize demands on its liquidity 
on a consolidated basis  net cash provided from operations was million for  million for and million for the positive cash flows for said periods were primarily attributable to net premiums written  net earnings  and increases in reserves for unpaid losses

the assets supporting the company s reserves continue to earn investment income until claim payments are made 
total assets increased from million at december  to million at december   and to million at december   primarily due to increases in cash  invested assets  and notes receivable

impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses are known and therefore before the extent by which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  the company may be limited in raising its premiums consistent with anticipated inflation  in which event the company  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the company s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on the company s investment income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in equity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company s consolidated balance sheets includes assets whose estimated fair values are subject to market risk

equity price risk the company invests funds in equity securities which have historically  over long periods of time  produced higher returns relative to fixed income investments 
the company intends to hold these investments over the long term 
this focus on long term total investment returns may result in variability in the level of unrealized investment gains and losses from one period to the next 
the changes in the estimated fair value of the equity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risk and shows the effect of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices as of december  the selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case scenarios dollars in thousands estimated fair hypothetical estimated value after percentage increase fair value at hypothetical hypothetical decrease in december  price change change in prices shareholders equity equity securities  increase  decrease  interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in interest rates typically result in decreases and increases in the fair value of these financial instruments 
approximately three quarters of the company s investable assets come from premiums paid by policyholders 
these funds are invested predominantly in high quality corporate  government and municipal bonds with relatively short durations 
the fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as interest rates rise  their fair values decline and as interest rates fall  the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio rises
