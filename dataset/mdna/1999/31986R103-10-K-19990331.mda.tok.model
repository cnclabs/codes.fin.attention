except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of fcg s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this prospectus 
fcg s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this section and the section entitled risks relating to the business of fcg as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview fcg provides services to payors  providers  government agencies  pharmaceutical  biogenetic  and life science companies  and other healthcare organizations in north america and europe 
fcg generates substantially all of its revenue from fees for professional services 
fcg typically bills for its services on an hourly  fixed fee or monthly fixed fee basis as specified by the agreement with a particular client 
fcg establishes either standard or target hourly rates for each level of consultant based on several factors including industry and assignment related experience  technical expertise  skills and knowledge 
for services billed on an hourly basis  fees are determined by multiplying the amount of time expended on each assignment by the hourly rate for the consultant s assigned to the engagement 
fixed fees are established on a per assignment or monthly basis and are based on several factors such as the size  scope  complexity and duration of an assignment and the number of consultants required to complete the assignment 
actual hourly or fixed fees for an assignment may vary from the standard  target  or historical rates charged by fcg 
for services billed on an hourly basis  fcg recognizes revenue as services are performed 
for services billed on a fixed fee basis  fcg recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method based on the amount of time completed on each assignment versus the projected number of hours required to complete such assignment 
revenue is recorded as incurred at assignment rates net of unplanned adjustments for specific engagements 
unplanned adjustments to revenue are booked at the time they are known 
out of pocket expenses are reimbursed by clients and offset against expenses incurred and are not included in recognized revenues 
provisions are made for estimated uncollectible amounts based on the company s experience 
fcg may obtain payment in advance of providing services 
these advances are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on fcg s balance sheet 
cost of services primarily consists of the salaries  bonuses and related benefits of client serving consultants and subcontractor expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of the costs attributable to the development of the business and the support of its client serving professionals  such as non billable travel  office space occupancy  investments in fcg s information systems  research and practice support and quality initiatives  salaries and expenses for executive management  financial accounting and administrative personnel  expenses for firm and service line governance meetings  recruiting fees and professional development and training  and marketing  legal and other professional services 
as associate related costs are relatively fixed  variations in fcg s revenues and operating results can occur as a result of variations in billing margins and utilization rates of its billable associates 
the company routinely reviews its fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that its services and compensation are competitive within the industry 
in addition  fcg routinely monitors the progress of client projects with its clients senior management 
quality of service questionnaires are sent to the client after each engagement with the results compiled and reported to fcg executive management 
in connection with the asop and certain non qualified stock options granted to fcg s vice presidents  fcg recognizes compensation expense on its consolidated statement of operations 
the recurring portion of fcg s compensation expense relating to stock issuances and the amortization of deferred compensation is reflected in fcg s consolidated statements of operations as general and administrative expenses or cost of services based on the function of the employee to whom the charge relates 
since  fcg has granted all stock options at fair market value 
in connection with the asop  fcg matches employee k contributions with shares of fcg common stock based on the fair market value of the shares 
fcg s most significant expenses are its human resource and related salary and benefit expenses 
as of december   approximately of fcg s  employees are consultants  and the salaries and benefits of such consultants are recognized in fcg s cost of services 
non billable employee salaries and benefits are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses 
fcg s cost of services as a percentage of revenue is directly related to its consultant utilization  which is the ratio of total billable hours to available hours in a given month 
fcg manages consultant utilization by monitoring assignment requirements and timetables  available and required skills  and available consultant hours per week and per month 
differences in personnel utilization rates can result from variations in the amount of non billed time  which has historically consisted of training time  vacation and holiday time  time lost to illness and inclement weather and unassigned time 
non billed time also includes time devoted to other necessary and productive activities such as sales support and interviewing prospective employees 
unassigned time results from differences in the timing of the completion of an existing assignment and the beginning of a new assignment 
in order to reduce and limit unassigned time  fcg actively manages personnel utilization by monitoring and projecting estimated engagement start and completion dates and matching consultant availability with current and projected client requirements 
the number of consultants staffed on an assignment will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the assignment 
assignment terminations  completions and scheduling delays may result in periods in which consultants are not optimally utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant assignment or an overall lengthening of the sales cycle could result in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants and could cause fcg to experience lower margins 
in addition  the opening of new offices  expansion into new markets  and the hiring of consultants in advance of client assignments have resulted and may continue to result in periods of lower consultant utilization 
fcg s effective tax rate has varied from period to period due to non deductible losses from fcg s foreign operations and differences between book and tax deductions associated with certain non deductible operating expenses  including certain compensation expenses related to the asop  and merger related activities 
the company believes that its tax rate has normalized around the rate level 
recent developments on september  the merger agreement in its definitive form with integrated systems consulting group iscg was executed and jointly announced 
on december   fcg completed its merger with iscg 
in december  fcg also completed a merger with pareto consulting ltd 
pareto 
the mergers were accounted for as poolings of interests and all prior period consolidated financial data presented herein has been restated to include the combined results of the acquisitions as though they had always been part of fcg

quarterly financial results the following table sets forth certain unaudited statements of operations data for the eight quarters ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of the company s net revenue for the periods indicated 
this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of the company s management  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with the company s annual audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
unaudited quarterly statements of operations in thousands  except per share data first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net revenue     cost of services     gross profit     general and administrative expenses     merger related cost  income from operations    interest income expense  net other income  net income before income taxes     provision for income taxes     net income loss     diluted net income loss per share net revenue     cost of services     gross profit     general and administrative expenses     compensation expenses related to stock issuances  income loss from operations    interest income expense  net other income  net income loss before income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income loss     diluted net income loss per share percentage of net revenue first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net revenue cost of services gross profit general and administrative expenses merger related cost income from operations interest income expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenue cost of services gross profit general and administrative expenses compensation expenses related to stock issuances income loss from operations interest income expense  net other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss a substantial portion of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation  office rent and occupancy costs  and  in the short run  personnel and related costs are relatively fixed 
certain client reimbursable costs are offset against expenses incurred  and are not included in recognized revenues 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors may include the reduction in size  delay in commencement  interruption or termination of one or more significant engagements or assignments  fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization  the loss of personnel  the loss of one or more significant clients  the unpredictability of engaging new clients and additional assignments from existing clients  increased competition  write offs of client billings  consolidation of  and subsequent reduction in the number of  healthcare providers  pricing pressure  the number  timing and contractual terms of significant client engagements  market demand for the company s services  delays or increased expenses incurred in connection with existing assignments  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes in the company s business strategies  variability in the number of business days within a quarter  and international currency fluctuations 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenue and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing between initial client contract and fulfillment of the criteria necessary for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenue in any given quarter can be materially adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
business practices of clients  such as deferring commitments on new assignments until after the end of fiscal periods  could require the company to maintain a significant number of under utilized consultants which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has experienced and will continue to experience variability in the number of billable days in any quarter 
the company typically experiences a lower number of billable days in the second and fourth quarters of every year 
the company requires attendance at an annual meeting of nearly two thirds of its employees in the second quarter of every year and encourages its employees to take vacation during the december holidays 
variability in the number of billable days may also result from other factors such as vacation days  sick time  paid and unpaid leave  inclement weather  and holidays  all of which could produce variability in the company s revenue and costs 
in the event of any downturn in potential clients businesses or the economy in general  planned utilization of the company s services may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on the preceding factors  the company may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings from expected levels or otherwise fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or the market in general  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   the company generated cash flow from operations of million 
during the year ended december   the company used cash flow of approximately million to purchase property and equipment  including computer and related equipment and office furniture 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was approximately million 
during the year ended december   the company generated cash flow of million from financing activities 
at december   the company had working capital of million and long term investments of million 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the primary reason for the increase in working capital and long term investments was the completion of the company s initial public offering in february essentially all of the million of ipo proceeds were retained as cash or investments at december  the company had a  revolving line of credit which was available through december   at the bank s prevailing prime rate 
the line was subsequently renewed through may  and increased to  the company also had a  line of credit which had been negotiated by iscg  and was terminated in december upon the consummation of the merger between fcg and iscg 
the company has a note payable to the bank with a remaining balance of  at december  the note bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus and is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest with the last installment due july  all borrowings under the company s credit facilities are secured by the company s accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles and equipment 
the line of credit agreement provides that the company must satisfy certain covenants and restrictions 
year compliance many existing computer programs and systems  including those used by fcg s clients  use only two digits to identify the year in the date field 
these programs may be unable to process date time information between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
this inability could cause the disruption or failure of such computer systems the yk problem 
solving the yk problem will require a large amount of time and resources 
fcg s clients may have to reallocate a significant portion of their budgets away from fcg s services to address this problem 
such reallocations would have a material adverse effect on fcg s business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  fcg is not able to predict the extent to which its clients will divert their resources to the yk problem or to estimate the impact  if any  this may have on fcg s revenues 
in addition  business interruptions experienced by fcg s clients due to the yk problem could result in reduced demand for fcg s services or delay in the payment of fcg s invoices 
such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on fcg s business 
additionally  fcg s current time and billing systems for its internal use are not yk compliant 
fcg has purchased an upgrade to these systems that will render them yk compliant and expects to complete deployment of this upgrade in the second quarter of the company estimates that the cost of such upgrade will be less than  there can be no assurance that such deployment will begin as planned or  if begun  will be completed in a timely and cost effective manner 
the computer systems of third parties with whom fcg regularly deals could be disrupted or fail  causing an interruption or decrease in fcg s ability to continue its operations 
fcg relies on third party relationships in the conduct of its business  including suppliers  vendors  utilities  financial institutions and others 
fcg has created a list of the third parties it believes are material to its operations and is attempting to obtain written assurances from them that there will be no interruption of service as a result of the yk problem 
where such assurances are not given  fcg intends  where practical  to devise contingency plans to allow fcg to operate in the event of yk related service interruption 
it is possible that fcg will experience interruptions in third party services despite vendors assurances otherwise  and that fcg will not be able to develop contingency plans to meet individual or multiple third party failures  resulting in an operations interruption that could materially adversely affect fcg s business 
fcg could be exposed to liabilities if any of the custom applications designed  built or modified by fcg for its clients are disrupted or fail 
fcg believes it is likely that certain custom software applications it designed  built or modified in the past are non yk compliant 
fcg has not made a determination of which custom applications may not be yk compliant 
further  fcg has not determined the extent to which it may be legally responsible for either fixing any non yk compliant applications or the consequences of such non compliance 
fcg has not quantified the impact that the foregoing risk could have on its business 
to better estimate the scope of this potential problem  fcg is planning to review representative samples of the custom applications it has worked on in its larger engagements in the past three years 
to the extent this review indicates that any of such applications are not yk compliant  fcg will evaluate whether such non compliance may result in liability for fcg 
even in the absence of legal liability  fcg may determine that it is in fcg s best interests to offer to fix non compliant applications under a variety of arrangements including at no charge or at rates below fcg s normal rates 
the failure of custom software applications delivered by fcg in the past to be yk compliant  and the liability or the need to devote additional resources that could result from such failure  could have a material adverse effect on fcg s business 
fcg has not yet devised  and may not be able to devise  a contingency plan that will adequately address all yk problem 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the yk problem  unforeseen and unpredictable costs and liabilities associated with the yk problem could materially adversely impact the business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations of fcg
