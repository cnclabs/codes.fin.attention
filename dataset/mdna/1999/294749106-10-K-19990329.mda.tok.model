item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the average realized prices of oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to market conditions 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves and other factors 
production rates  value based production taxes  labor and maintenance expenses are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period 
oil and gas reserves 
during  crude oil prices reached year lows  and remained near those levels for much of the year 
natural gas prices in were lower than this decrease in prices had a significant effect on the volumes and values of the company s reserves 
estimates of reserve quantities and related future net cash flows are calculated using unescalated year end oil and gas prices and operating costs  and may be subject to substantial fluctuations based on the prices in effect at the end of each year 
the following table sets forth a comparison of year end reserves  the weighted average prices used in calculating estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows  pre tax future net cash flows discounted at  and per barrel of oil equivalent discounted cash flows at the end of  and quantities in thousands  except for pricing and per barrel of oil equivalent amounts sec year end year end sec pre tax proved reserves prices pre tax values mbbls mmcf oil gas boe oil gas values per boe gas converted at  mcf per barrel 
reserve revisions occur when the economic limit of a property is lengthened or shortened due to changes in commodity pricing 
the following excerpt from the footnotes to the company s financial statements shows the effect of depressed oil prices on the volume of oil reserves shown in thousands of barrels year ended december  proved oil reserves s beginning of year    revisions of previous estimates  extensions and discoveries acquisitions of minerals in place  sales of minerals in place production end of year    the negative revisions of  and  barrels in and  respectively  are primarily price related and take into account those properties where production has been shut in due to marginal economics 
excluding revisions to previous estimates  the company s drilling program in added  barrels of oil equivalent reserves  of production 
the company did not make any producing property acquisitions in should oil and gas prices remain at their current low levels for the balance of  further reductions in capital spending for are likely  which may impact the company s ability to replace production 
the company continues to high grade both exploratory and development projects based on their assumed risks and rewards  balancing this with projects that have specific lease related drilling commitments 
other projects have been delayed or deferred until oil prices strengthen and cash flows increase 
drilling and acquisition activities in the united states and canada added million barrels of oil equivalent to the company s proved reserve base  replacing of production 
in  the company added million barrels of oil equivalent  equal to of oil and gas production 
further information concerning the company s reserve volumes and values can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as a result of depressed year end oil prices  the company recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   net of tax as of december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires successful efforts companies to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying costs of their proved oil and gas properties by comparing the expected undiscounted future net revenues from each producing field with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues from the producing field 
during  the company wrote down the costs of several properties characterized by low margin production  where low oil prices have severely reduced the economic value of their reserves 
during and  the company recorded proved property impairment charges of  and  respectively 
equity loss and impairment of investment in symskaya exploration  incorporated 
in  symskaya plugged and abandoned the lemok well  and charged the drilling costs of the well to expense 
due to the uncertainty relating to symskaya s obtaining additional outside financing and proceeding with development of the license area  all other capitalized costs related to the company s investment in and advances to symskaya were also written off  resulting in a total charge to expense of  the company has no current plans to fund future exploratory drilling in russia 
the company s share of symskaya s net losses in and were  and  respectively  which resulted primarily from administrative related expenses 
the amount includes a write off of approximately  in interest income on a senior note between symskaya and the company that had been accrued in prior periods  as well as the company s share of the bottom hole contribution discussed earlier 
further discussion of this venture is found in item properties  under the caption present activity  and in footnotes and to the financial statements 
results of operations comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
despite record gas production and higher oil production  lower oil and gas prices during resulted in a drop in oil and gas sales 
gas production of bcf in  the highest level in company history  was higher than bcf produced in oil production of  barrels was higher than the  barrels produced in average oil prices for were lower than those of the company s average oil price received for was per barrel  compared to per barrel in gas prices also dipped by  averaging in  compared to in further details of production and pricing are found in item properties  under the caption production 
other income 
during  the company recorded a gain on the sale of certain oil and gas properties of approximately  in addition  the company sold its minority interest in an oil field technology research company 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a gain of approximately  there were no corresponding events in lease operating costs 
lease operating costs continued to decline on a per unit basis in costs per barrel of oil equivalent during of were lower than costs of per barrel of oil equivalent during during much of  the company shut in several high cost  marginally economic wells whose profitability was severely curtailed by low oil prices 
another factor in the decline was a reduction in value based production taxes 
as the majority of the company s production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis comes from crude oil  the decline in average oil prices in brought about declines in production taxes 
in addition  operating costs associated with natural gas properties are lower on a barrel of oil equivalent basis than for oil producing properties 
the company s ratio of gas to oil production continued to rise in compared to prior years  and as it did so  per barrel of oil equivalent operating costs declined 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a 
dd a charges in declined slightly to per barrel of oil equivalent from per barrel of oil equivalent in impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
equity loss and impairment of investment in symskaya exploration  incorporated 
the company is continuing to pursue additional outside financing for its symskaya project in russia 
the company announced in that its owned subsidiary  symskaya  entered into a bottom hole contribution agreement to support the drilling of an exploratory well that is being drilled near the southern block of acreage that symskaya holds as part of its million acre exploration  development and production license 
the equity loss in symskaya increased by approximately  during this increase included a write down of approximately  of accrued interest income on a senior note between symskaya and the company that had been recognized in prior periods 
in addition  the increase includes the company s share of the bottom hole contribution 
there were no corresponding events in d seismic and exploration expenses 
during  the company incurred  in d seismic costs related to its exploration programs  compared to  in the bulk of d costs were associated with its sequoia project in the san joaquin basin of california 
the initial well at sequoia has been delayed until the first half of exploration expenses decreased as the company drilled exploratory dry holes in  compared to dry holes in successful efforts accounting  the method used by the company  requires both d seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs to be charged to expense on a current basis 
interest and income taxes 
higher interest costs in reflect the higher amount of debt outstanding under the company s credit facility 
the income tax benefits recorded for both periods result primarily from the deferred tax benefits associated with net losses reported 
details concerning the components of the tax provision can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
the company s increases in oil and gas and sales were due largely to increases in natural gas production and prices 
during  the company s gas production increased  from bcf in to bcf in average prices of per mcf in were higher than the received in the increase in gas production reflected the contribution from the company s exploration and development programs in california and wyoming 
offsetting the increases in gas production and pricing  oil production was essentially flat from year to year  with  barrels produced in  compared to  barrels in while year end oil prices experienced a sharp decline from the prior year  the decline in average prices received throughout the year was somewhat milder 
average prices of per barrel were lower than the per barrel received in further details of production and pricing are found in item properties  under the caption production 
other income 
during the first half of  the company recorded a gain on the sale of certain oil and gas properties of approximately  the properties sold had reserves of less than  barrels of oil 
there was no corresponding event in in addition  during the third quarter of  the company sold its minority interest in an oil field technology research company 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a gain of approximately  these two transactions combined to increase other income by over levels 
lease operating costs 
despite a higher number of wells on production during as compared to  lease operating costs declined on a per unit basis 
the primary factor in the decline was a reduction in value based production taxes 
as the majority of the company s production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis comes from crude oil  the decline in average oil prices in brought about a similar decline in production taxes 
in addition  operating costs associated with natural gas properties were lower on a barrel of oil equivalent basis than for oil producing properties 
the company s ratio of gas to oil production continued to rise in  and as it did so  per barrel of oil equivalent costs declined 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a 
increased dd a charges in were a direct reflection of lower year end oil prices used in calculating reserves 
generally speaking  as oil prices decline  economic oil reserves also decline 
as these reserves decline  extraction percentages increase  resulting in higher dd a charges 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
equity loss and impairment of investment in symskaya exploration  incorporated 
as discussed above  in  symskaya plugged and abandoned the lemok well  and charged the drilling costs of the well to expense 
due to the uncertainty relating to symskaya s obtaining additional outside financing and proceeding with development of the license area  all other capitalized costs related to the company s investment in and advances to symskaya were also written off  resulting in a total charge to expense in of   after tax 
the company s share of symskaya s net loss in was  which resulted primarily from administrative related expenses 
d seismic and exploration expenses 
during  the company incurred  in d seismic costs related to its exploration programs  compared to  in exploration expenses increased as the company drilled exploratory dry holes in  compared to dry holes in successful efforts accounting  the method used by the company  requires both d seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs to be charged to expense on a current basis 
general and administrative expenses 
the company recorded increases in compensation expense  along with small increases in other administrative charges during interest expense 
during  because of its ongoing exploration project in russia  the company was required to capitalize all interest expense 
with activity in russia curtailed in  interest was charged to expense 
along with increased borrowing on the company s revolving credit facility  this caused interest expense to increase during over levels 
income taxes 
income tax expense for includes additional taxes arising from an audit of the company s canadian tax returns 
the adjustment resulted in the accrual of approximately  in additional canadian taxes related to prior years 
the income tax benefit in resulted primarily from the deferred tax benefit associated with the net loss reported 
details concerning the components of the tax expense can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital 
total cash balances increased from  as a result of a combination of several events discussed in the following paragraphs 
working capital decreased by primarily due to lower accrued oil and gas sales 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   compared to to at december  cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities declined in compared to levels  primarily as a result of lower revenues caused by depressed oil and gas prices 
despite higher oil and gas production in  oil and gas sales dropped by million 
cash flows decreased from levels as a result of a reduction in accounts payable balances  which is mainly a function of timing 
cash flows from investing activities 
capital expenditures in were lower than in excluding property acquisitions  expenditures in were down 
this decrease in capital spending is a direct result of decreased revenues resulting from lower oil and gas prices 
should oil prices remain at their current low levels for the balance of  the company expects further reductions in capital spending for the company continues to high grade both exploratory and development projects based on their assumed risks and rewards  balancing this with projects that have specific lease related drilling commitments 
other projects have been delayed or deferred until oil prices strengthen and cash flows increase 
capital expenditures in were higher than the amount recorded in included in the figures were million associated with proved property acquisitions  and million associated with unproved property acquisitions 
during  the company incurred million and 
million  respectively  for these property acquisitions 
subsequent to the plugging of the lemok in  the company s advances to symskaya exploration  inc decreased significantly 
during and the company advanced approximately  and  to symskaya  respectively  compared to approximately million in the company expects that advances to symskaya in will again be minimal as the company has no current plans to fund any exploratory drilling in russia 
the equity loss in symskaya exploration for includes a writedown of approximately  in interest income on a senior note between symskaya and the company that had been accrued in prior periods 
in addition  the amount included the company s share of a bottom hole contribution discussed earlier 
neither of these two events are recurring 
cash flows from financing activities 
the company used proceeds of   and  in  and respectively  from its revolving credit facility to fund capital expenditures 
the company purchased  shares of its stock on the open market during at an average price of per share 
the purchases were made pursuant to a share repurchase program adopted by the company in june of no treasury stock was purchased during the company purchased  shares of its stock during at an average price of per share 
credit facility 
in march of  the company obtained a million borrowing base credit facility the facility 
on march   the company amended its credit agreement  setting the current commitment under the facility at million 
in addition  on june   the facility was further amended in order to set the first principal payment date to july  from july  the company s commitment under the facility is subject to a redetermination as of july and january of each year  with reserve values calculated using estimated future prices determined by the company s lender 
using a reduced oil price deck  brought about by continued low oil prices  the company s borrowing base was lowered to million after the july  redetermination  and the company was notified to this effect in september of as of december  the outstanding balance under the facility was million at an average interest rate of 
accordingly  at the end of  the company had approximately  of remaining availability on the facility 
primarily as a result of the million property impairment charge  as of december  the company was in violation of the tangible net worth covenant contained in the facility 
in march  the company s bank amended the facility to remedy the covenant violation 
the company is now in compliance with all covenants in the facility 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flows from operating activities  and funds available under the company s credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund on going operations and will allow the company to meet limited capital and exploration spending objectives for the company s drilling plans for have been significantly curtailed due to low oil prices 
the ability of the company to replace its production volumes through drilling with curtailed budgets may be significantly impaired 
should the low oil price environment continue for an extended period of time  the company may have difficulty in meeting its ongoing exploration and development drilling objectives 
the company has adequate liquidity to maintain its operations as they currently exist 
commitments 
under the terms of symskaya s license and production sharing contract psc  equity was committed to advance symskaya a minimum of million during the first contract years  representing of the minimum expenditures called for in the license and psc  with the remainder being funded by leucadia national corporation  symskaya s other shareholder 
the first contract year began november  the amounts spent through november   the end of the fifth contract year  have satisfied all minimum commitments required 
further discussion of this venture is found in item properties  under the caption present activity  and in footnotes and to the financial statements 
other items 
the company has reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
based on that review  the company believes that none of these pronouncements will have any significant effects on current or future earnings or operations 
year in  the company began a project to ensure that its computer systems were year compliant 
the company identified this project as a priority and has allocated personnel and financial resources to it in an effort to minimize the impact of year date related problems 
an officer of the company is supervising the project 
in addition  the company is conducting a year compliance assessment of those of its vendors and customers whose relationship  in the company s business judgment  is material 
although the company s assessment of its year issues is not complete  the company has made a preliminary determination of its mission critical and non mission critical items 
the company s mission critical items include its financial accounting  engineering  and lease land software 
each of these items has either been certified by the vendor as year compliant  or the vendor has certified that a compliant version of the software will be in place before june  all non mission critical systems have been certified as being compliant 
the company is conducting tests to support these claims 
the company does not anticipate incurring any significant expense to ensure year compliance 
although the company is undertaking this project  no assurance can be given that such a program will be able to solve the year issues applicable to the company or that failure to solve will not have a material adverse effect on the company
