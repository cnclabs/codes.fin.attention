item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of its large investment portfolio 
as stated in the company s written investment policy  the company s investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
the company mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  investment liquidity  broad diversification across investment strategies  and limits on the types of investment assets that may be used 
moreover  the policy requires strict due diligence of each manager both before employment and on an on going basis 
foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in more than countries throughout the world and  therefore  can be exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates 
currency exposures are related only to the us us pound sterling exchange rate arising from invoicing european customers in pounds sterling from the company s uk office and to the uk dollar japanese yen exchange rate arising from purchases of some thermal transfer ribbons denominated in yen 
there is no foreign exchange risk associated with the company s investment portfolio 
the company manages its foreign exchange exposure through a policy of selective hedging 
this policy involves selling forward up to days  projected remittances in pounds sterling from the company s uk subsidiary 
the company also purchases a limited number of yen contracts to hedge the cost of yen denominated invoices from certain suppliers 
this policy mitigates  but does not eliminate  the impact of exchange movements on the value of future cash flows 
thus  adverse movements in either the pound or the yen in relation to the dollar can directly impact the company s financial results 
all foreign exchange contracts are executed by the corporate treasury department only with major financial institutions 
under no circumstances does the company enter into any type of foreign exchange contract for trading or speculative purposes 
equity price risk the company does not generally invest in marketable equity securities  except as part of its acquisition strategy  although one of its investment managers utilizes a market neutral strategy that involves offsetting long short equity positions 
the company held no direct equity positions as of december  the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 
the following table sets forth the impact of a movement in interest rates on the value of the company s investment portfolio as of december  similarly  the impact of a change in the value of all equity positions held by the company s investment managers is tabulated 
the impact of a movement in the dollar pound and dollar yen rates is measured as if the company did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and is based on the actual yen obligations of the company as of december   and the present value of the projected average monthly remittances from the company s uk subsidiary for the first quarter of interest rate sensitive instruments  foreign exchange dollar pound  dollar yen  equity price sensitive instruments
