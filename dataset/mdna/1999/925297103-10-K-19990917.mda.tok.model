year certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures and in miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem 
on august   the company s board of directors adopted a comprehensive strategy for achieving year readiness program for versar and its subsidiaries 
the versar year program is designed to a identify computer systems hardware and software and other equipment telecommunications equipment and technical field equipment that may fail to recognize or properly process data on or after january   b upgrade or replace all non compliant systems  components  and software  and c evaluate the year readiness of key clients and critical vendors and service providers 
subsequently  management has implemented the eight step program to identify both internally and externally the extent of any year problem  the cost to the company to mitigate any year effects and identify any significant client or subcontractor compliance issues 
these actions included a comprehensive survey of internal equipment  systems and software to identify potential year failures 
this included a physical inventory of such equipment and products 
we surveyed suppliers of such equipment  systems and software on their year readiness and any requirements for change or upgrade 
the company then implemented a company wide program to replace  modify  upgrade and test such equipment  systems and software 
presently  versar does not believe that the year program will result in any additional material investments  nor does versar have any information that the year problem will have material adverse effects on the business  operations or financial performance of versar 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company and its subsidiaries modified its financial reporting and project management software  and computer systems to be year ready 
the estimated total costs incurred for the year program for hardware  software and internal costs is approximately  the company expects any additional year related costs to be minimal 
in addition  after completing a survey of significant customers and suppliers  versar is not aware of any year problems of its customers  suppliers or network affiliates that will have a material adverse effect on the business  operations or financial performance of versar 
based on the above survey and the work completed on versar s company wide computers and software  the company does not anticipate any significant risks and  therefore  has not developed a year contingency plan
