item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company s revenues have increased significantly during the past three years due to internal growth and acquisitions 
however  net earnings and diluted earnings per share trends were negatively affected by special items in each of these years 
the following table summarizes the company s revenue and earnings during this period dollars in millions  except for per share amounts years ended september  change net sales and other revenues earnings excluding special items special items net earnings diluted earnings per share earnings excluding special items special items net earnings special items represent charges or writedowns which management believes are either one time occurrences or otherwise not related to ongoing operations  and are described under the caption special items below 
such items have been shown separately in order to facilitate analysis of the company s operating trends 
fiscal earnings and diluted earnings per share  excluding special items  declined and  respectively  in comparison with fiscal the slight decline in net earnings  despite higher revenues  principally relates to higher interest expense associated with the additional debt incurred or assumed in connection with certain acquisitions 
lower earnings per share principally reflects the effect of the company s issuance of additional shares of common stock in connection with certain acquisitions 
the company s operating results include the results of acquired entities during the past three years 
such acquisitions  which are described in more detail under the caption business acquisitions herein  are summarized as follows acquisition date acquired entity segment april pharmerica  inc pharmaceutical services february jm blanco  inc pharmaceutical distribution january stadtlander operating company  llc pharmaceutical services december medical initiatives  inc pharmaceutical distribution september ransdell surgical  inc other businesses september choice systems  inc other businesses august the lash group  inc other businesses may pacific criticare  inc other businesses january besse medical services  inc pharmaceutical distribution as described below  of the acquired entities  pharmerica and stadtlander have had the most significant impact on the company s results of operations 
each of the transactions listed above is reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements only from the respective acquisition date 
operating earnings the company reported increases in operating earnings  excluding special items  of and in fiscal and  respectively 
the following table provides a summarized statement of operations on a consolidated basis  including key line item growth rates and ratios 
pharmerica and stadtlander  due to the nature of their pharmaceutical service businesses  have significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the company s principal pharmaceutical distribution businesses 
accordingly  certain ratios in the table have also been shown excluding pharmerica and stadtlander in order to present a more meaningful comparison with historical results 
years ended september  change dollars in millions revenues excluding bulk shipments bulk shipments total net sales and other revenues gross profit operating expenses excluding special items operating earnings before special items special items special receivables provision special charges operating earnings percentage of revenues excluding bulk shipments gross profit operating expenses  excluding special items operating earnings before special items operating earnings percentage of revenues excluding pharmerica and stadtlander in fiscal gross profit operating expenses  excluding special items operating earnings before special items operating earnings revenues excluding bulk shipments increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
of the fiscal increase  represented internal growth while represented the effect of acquired entities 
virtually all of the fiscal increase was attributable to internal growth  with only a minor portion attributable to acquired entities 
along with other companies in its industry  the company reports bulk shipments of pharmaceuticals in revenues and cost of sales 
bulk shipment transactions are arranged by the company with its suppliers at the express direction of the customer  and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to company warehouses for immediate shipment to customers warehouse sites 
bulk sales of pharmaceuticals do not impact the company s inventory since the company simply processes the orders that it receives from its suppliers directly to the customers warehouses 
the company serves as an intermediary by paying the supplier and billing the customer for the goods 
due to the insignificant margins generated through bulk shipments  fluctuations in such revenues have only an immaterial impact on the company s operating earnings 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues excluding bulk shipments gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively  excluding the effect of pharmerica and stadtlander 
of the fiscal decrease of basis points  approximately basis points represent the effect of lifo reserve provisions 
the remaining basis point reduction in and the basis point reduction in fiscal primarily reflect lower margins in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 
such margins declined mainly due to intense price competition within the industry as well as to a change in the sales mix  with a greater proportion of revenues coming from high volume  low margin customers 
the favorable effect of inventory investment buying profits partially offset the aforementioned factors 
gross margins were also slightly lower in the other businesses segment  primarily due to a higher medical surgical sales mix of lower margin shipments to the acute care market 
in all of the company s wholesale distribution businesses  it is customary to pass on manufacturers price increases to customers 
investment buying enables distributors such as the company to benefit by purchasing goods in advance of anticipated manufacturers price increases 
consequently  the rate or frequency of future price increases by manufacturers  or the lack thereof  influences the profitability of the company 
management anticipates further downward pressure on gross margins in the distribution businesses in fiscal because of continued price competition influenced by high volume customers 
management expects that these pressures may be offset to some extent by an increased sales mix of more profitable products and services and continued reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
however  no assurance can be given that such improved sales mix or expense reduction can be achieved since many of the factors that impact such results eg the effect of group purchasing agreements  competitive inroads  market conditions  etc 
are outside the company s control 
operating expenses excluding special items include distribution  selling  general and administrative expenses dsg a and the provision for doubtful receivables 
excluding pharmerica and stadtlander  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues excluding bulk shipments were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant reductions were primarily attributable to continued operating efficiencies and the spreading of fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
the company s distribution infrastructure has been able to process increasing volume without a proportionate increase in operating expenses 
also  the aforementioned shift in the distribution businesses mix towards high volume customers reduced the operating expense ratio because these customers are less costly to service 
segment information substantially all of the company s growth in operating earnings has been contributed by the pharmaceutical distribution segment 
following is a summary of revenue and operating earnings for the company s segments dollars in millions revenue excluding bulk shipments growth rate years ended september  pharmaceutical distribution pharmaceutical services other businesses corporate intersegment eliminations total operating earnings growth rate years ended september  fifo basis  excluding special items pharmaceutical distribution pharmaceutical services other businesses corporate total  fifo basis excluding special items lifo charges credits special items total  lifo basis including special items operating earnings as a percentage of revenue excluding bulk shipments pharmaceutical distribution pharmaceutical services other businesses total  fifo basis excluding special items total  lifo basis including special items pharmaceutical distribution revenues increased and in fiscal and  respectively  substantially all of which represented internal growth only resulted from acquisitions 
bbdc s revenue increased and  respectively  reflecting increased volume across all geographic regions and major customer categories 
asd s revenues increased and  respectively  representing continued growth in all of its specialty product markets 
these increases were comprised of higher shipments to existing bbdc and asd customers as well as to a significant number of new customers 
national industry economic conditions were also favorable  with increases in prescription drug usage and higher pharmaceutical prices contributing to this segment s revenue growth 
operating earnings have grown at a rate equal to or higher than revenues  with increases of and in fiscal and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  operating income was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the past two years  this segment has been able to achieve operating expense efficiencies which have offset or exceeded the reductions in gross margins it has experienced see operating earnings section above 
pharmaceutical services substantially all of the revenue growth in fiscal represented sales by pharmerica million and stadtlander million since their acquisition dates in late april and late january  respectively 
the only other activity in this segment was related to a small mail service entity 
the pharmaceutical services segment operated at just above the breakeven level  excluding special items  in fiscal  with pharmerica reporting a profit and stadtlander reporting a loss 
pharmerica s operations have been adversely affected by negative industry trends resulting from dramatically lower reimbursement to nursing homes for medicare patients under the prospective payment system pps 
the adverse effects of pps included lower occupancy by medicare funded patients at nursing facilities serviced by pharmerica  significantly diminished acuity levels among residents of these facilities  which reduced the overall utilization of drugs  and increased customer pricing pressure  thereby reducing pharmerica s gross margins 
while the company did see some stabilization of these trends in the fourth quarter  management expects that they will continue to affect pharmerica throughout fiscal management has taken steps designed to improve pharmerica s earnings  including enabling pharmerica to participate in the company s generic purchasing programs in order to reduce drug costs  consolidation of pharmacies to streamline operations  outsourcing of delivery services  strengthening of billing and collections management and conversion of pharmerica s long term care pharmacies to a common proprietary as computer system 
stadtlander has shown revenue growth from its pre acquisition period in all of its major markets 
however  it reported an operating loss primarily due to unexpectedly high bad debt provisions and lower than expected gross margins 
stadtlander has taken steps designed to improve receivables collection going forward  for example  stadtlander has implemented new accounts receivable software  strengthened its billing controls  outsourced certain collection activities  and engaged the lash group to assist in obtaining reimbursement sources for indigent patients 
although no assurances can be given  management anticipates that days sales outstanding and bad debt losses will be lower by the end of fiscal in response to lower than expected gross margins  stadtlander is taking several steps designed to improve earnings  including consolidation of branches to streamline operations  reengineering of business processes and seeking better contractual relationships in the marketplace through its relationships with payors and pharmaceutical companies 
for further information regarding stadtlander and pharmerica  see special items below 
other businesses revenue increased and in fiscal and  respectively  principally related to a higher volume of medical surgical shipments 
in fiscal  acquired entities provided of the segment s increase while internal growth accounted for the remaining 
in fiscal  the effect of acquired entities comprised only of the increase  with internal growth contributing the remaining 
operating earnings increased in fiscal after declining in fiscal the increase in fiscal primarily reflects improved profitability of the bbmc medical surgical business due to higher revenue  operating expense efficiencies resulting from a restructuring program  and lower intangibles amortization 
partially offsetting these favorable factors were operating losses at ics and choice  which are still considered to be in a start up phase 
the significant decline in operating earnings in fiscal primarily reflected an unexpected slowdown in revenues and gross margin at bbmc  prior to the implementation of the restructuring program 
corporate corporate expenses decreased million in fiscal and increased million in fiscal these fluctuations primarily reflect changes in incentive compensation under the company s bonus plans 
lifo charges credits the company principally manages its operations on a fifo first in  first out basis  in which inventories are valued at the most recent purchase costs 
for external financial reporting purposes  however  the company uses the lifo last in  first out method  whereby cost of sales is calculated at the most recent purchase costs and inventory is valued at the earlier purchase costs 
due to a history of generally rising prices  fifo inventory is higher than lifo inventory  and a lifo reserve is maintained to adjust fifo inventories to lifo at year end 
the lifo provision represents the non cash earnings effect of adjusting the lifo reserve during the year 
the fiscal lifo provision was unfavorably affected by the timing of manufacturers price increases and the unavailability of certain inventory items to the company 
special items following is a summary of special items during the past three years and their effect on net earnings and earnings per share dollars in millions  except per share amounts years ended september  segment description pharmaceutical services receivables provision other businesses goodwill writedown other businesses restructuring expenses corporate abandoned capitalized software corporate merger related expenses total special items tax effect of special items effect on net earnings effect on diluted earnings per share during fiscal  the company recorded a special receivables provision of million consisting of additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at pharmerica and stadtlander  respectively  principally related to pre acquisition receivables and the adverse effect of medicare pps on pharmerica s customer base 
during fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge of million for the writedown of bbmc goodwill related to certain acquisitions made prior to september  resulting from a realized impairment to the carrying value of bbmc s long lived assets 
the company also recorded a million charge for bbmc restructuring expenses  which represented severance costs associated with streamlining and refocusing the sales organization and costs associated with the consolidations of four divisions to improve efficiency and customer service 
other special charges included million for the abandonment of capitalized software and million related primarily to the proposed merger with cardinal health  inc cardinal  which was terminated on august  during fiscal  the company reported a million charge for expenses related to the proposed merger with ivax corporation  which was terminated on march  all of the aforementioned special items have a current or deferred tax benefit except for the goodwill writedown 
interest expense and distributions on preferred securities the company s financing expenses are comprised of two line items on the statements of consolidated earnings dollars in millions years ended september  net interest expense pre tax distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust pre tax less tax benefit total financing expenses were million in fiscal  including net interest expense of million and million of pre tax distributions on the company s preferred securities  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to higher borrowings under the company s bank credit agreements  new borrowings under a commercial paper program  debt assumed in connection with acquisitions  and the issuance of the preferred securities 
the fiscal increase of million  or  over fiscal resulted from increased borrowings under the company s bank credit agreements 
in fiscal  a significant portion of the higher borrowings was related to the financing of the purchase price of acquired entities and the assumption of the debt of those entities 
in both fiscal and  borrowing increased to fund higher investments in inventory in order to a support the significant growth in the company s revenues  and b to take advantage of increased investment buying opportunities 
taxes on income taxes on income  excluding the tax benefit on distributions of company s preferred securities  were  and of pre tax earnings in fiscal  and  respectively 
the unusually high fiscal rate reflects the nondeductible writedown of goodwill described under special items above  excluding the writedown  the effective tax rate would have been 
the increase in the effective rate in fiscal is mainly attributable to the additional nondeductible goodwill amortization associated with pharmerica  jm blanco and certain other acquired entities 
all of the goodwill amortization of stadtlander is tax deductible 
earnings per share earnings per share fluctuations normally result primarily from changes in the company s net earnings 
however  in fiscal  diluted earnings per share were impacted by a increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  to million shares from million shares in fiscal the increase was primarily related to the issuance of million shares in connection with the acquisition of pharmerica in april and the issuance of million shares in connection with the acquisition of stadtlander in january there were million shares of the company s common stock outstanding at september  liquidity and capital resources following is a summary of the company s capitalization at the end of the last three fiscal years 
except that debt is net of cash herein  these percentages are calculated in accordance with the covenants set forth in the company s credit agreement and credit facility  in which certain non cash charges are excluded from the calculation september  debt  net of cash equity  including the preferred securities the increase in the debt percentage is mainly due to an increase in borrowings  including those under bank credit agreements  discretionary bank lines and commercial paper agreements  as well as debt assumed in connection with acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by increases in equity resulting from the issuance of shares of the company s common stock in connection with acquisitions  the issuance of the preferred securities  and the company s net earnings 
the company currently has billion of available credit under committed revolving bank credit lines  consisting of a million senior credit agreement the credit agreement and a million senior credit facility the credit facility 
the credit agreement and the credit facility rank on a parity with each other 
the credit agreement with a group of domestic and foreign banks is effective through march and allows additional borrowings under discretionary lines outside the credit agreement 
the credit facility with a group of banks was initiated in april and expires in april the company expects to renew the credit facility for another day period and will begin the related discussions with its bank group in january also in april  the company entered into a series of commercial paper agreements the commercial paper agreements with a group of commercial paper dealers which provides for the private placement of short term commercial paper notes of the company up to a maximum of billion outstanding 
the commercial paper agreements allow maturities of up to days from the date of issue and are backed by the credit agreement and senior credit facility 
the amount of credit available under the credit agreement and credit facility are reduced dollar for dollar by the amount outstanding under the commercial paper agreements 
outstanding borrowings under the aforementioned agreements at september  totaled million  consisting of million under the credit agreement and discretionary lines and million under the commercial paper agreements 
on may   the company s bergen capital trust the trust issued  shares of its preferred securities at per security 
the proceeds of such issuances were invested by the trust in million aggregate principal amount of the company s subordinated notes 
the company used the net proceeds from this investment for general corporate purposes  principally retirement of a portion of its outstanding debt 
the subordinated notes represent the sole assets of the trust and bear interest at the rate of  payable quarterly  and are redeemable by the company beginning in may at of the principal amount thereof 
the obligations of the trust related to the preferred securities are guaranteed by the company 
the company s registration statement  which became effective on march   allows the company to sell senior and subordinated debt or equity securities to the public from time to time up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
see notes and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the credit agreement  the credit facility  the commercial paper agreements  the preferred securities and the registration statement 
in december  the company s credit agreement and credit facility were amended to  among other things  a allow the company or any of its subsidiaries to sell  transfer or convey certain trade receivables which would result in aggregate proceeds not to exceed million  and b modify certain financial covenants 
on december   the company entered into an asset securitization program with a bank which provides additional borrowing capacity for the company the asset securitization program 
the initial funded amount is million  which the company is working to increase to million in the second quarter of fiscal through the asset securitization program  the company s bergen brunswig drug company subsidiary will sell  on an ongoing basis  accounts receivable generated by certain of its divisions to a special purpose subsidiary 
that special purpose subsidiary will  in turn  sell such receivables to banking institutions 
on september   the company declared a for stock split on the company s common stock  which was paid on december  to shareowners of record on november  all share and per share amounts presented herein have been restated to reflect the effect of this stock split 
cash dividends declared on common stock amounted to  
and 
per share in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal amount includes a 
per share quarterly dividend which was declared on september  but not paid until december  to shareholders of record on november  the 
dividend constituted the company s fiscal first quarter dividend  the declaration was made earlier than usual to coincide with the announcement of the aforementioned for stock split 
had the timing of the declaration been made in the usual manner  dividends for fiscal and would have been 
and  respectively 
on november   the company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per share  payable on december  to shareowners of record on november  although the company does not have a policy requiring the payment of any specified levels of dividends  the company s historical dividends have averaged approximately of net earnings before special items for the three year period ended september  the company s cash flows during the past three years are summarized in the following table dollars in millions years ended september  net earnings excluding non cash charges increases in operating assets and liabilities cash flows from operations property acquisitions acquisition of businesses  less cash acquired proceeds of debt and trust preferred securities repayment of debt and other obligations cash dividends other net net increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  the company borrowed significantly more funds than in prior years  primarily in order to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the stadtlander and jm blanco acquisitions  to pay off debt assumed with those acquisitions and the pharmerica acquisition  and to fund working capital requirements to support the company s growing operations 
the large negative cash flow from operations in fiscal is primarily associated with the pharmaceutical distribution segment  which had higher receivables and inventory in connection with higher sales levels 
in addition  the timing of the related payments for inventory purchases was such that there was a relatively small benefit from accounts payable 
the company believes that internally generated cash flows  funds available under the credit agreement  the credit facility  the commercial paper agreements  the asset securitization program  and funds potentially available in the private and public capital markets will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash and capital requirements 
however  actual results could differ from this forward looking statement as a result of unanticipated capital requirements or an inability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms when  and if  necessary 
such access to the capital markets may be more difficult or expensive in the future due to the downgrading of the company s debt ratings in november and december working capital increased to million at september  from million at september  the increase primarily reflects higher receivables and inventory balances supporting significant revenue growth as well as acquired entities 
the current ratio decreased slightly to at september  from at september  trade receivables outstanding  net of customer credit balances  were days during fiscal and days during fiscal  substantially all of the increase was due to pharmerica and stadtlander which  due to the nature of their customers  have a significantly longer receivables collection cycle than the company s distribution operations 
the inventory turnover rate on fifo basis was times during fiscal and times during fiscal property acquisitions relate principally to improvements at several new warehouse and office locations  warehouse and pharmacy equipment  and data processing equipment

year readiness disclosure the year problem results from computer programs and devices which do not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer systems that have date sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year this situation may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly or not at all  which would result in significant disruptions of the company s business activities 
since the company relies heavily on computer technology throughout its businesses to effectively carry out its day to day operations  it has made resolution of the year problem a major corporate initiative 
in october  the company established a central office to direct its company wide year efforts for all of its businesses  including bbdc  bbmc  asd and other subsidiaries 
a steering committee comprised of several executive officers provides top level oversight for the program 
both internal and external resources have been used to identify  correct and test the company s systems for year compliance 
the company s year program addressed both information technology it and non it systems 
the company s business applications reside on mainframe  midrange and desktop computer systems 
the company s it infrastructure is comprised of hardware  internally developed software  and software purchased from external vendors 
the company s non it systems include equipment which uses date sensitive embedded technology 
principal non it systems include telecommunications equipment  automated warehouse equipment  and hand held order entry devices which the company has provided to its customers 
the company has divided its year program by business unit and functional area into numerous individual projects in order to provide detailed management for each at risk system 
the company s approach has been to address each year project in the following phases inventory  assessment  planning  renovation  testing and internal certification 
for bbdc  all systems have now been tested and internally certified as year compliant 
in addition  bbdc performed comprehensive enterprise integration testing of all major it systems  including order fulfillment  procurement  financial services and accounting 
bbmc and asd are comprised of a number of entities acquired during the last several years 
although some of the computer systems within these entities were year complaint  certain significant computer systems were not year compliant 
certain of the non compliant systems were remediated for year compliance while the remainder were replaced with year compliant systems 
all of bbmc s and asd s systems have now been tested and internally certified as year compliant 
pharmerica  which was acquired on april   had also centralized its year readiness efforts under an executive steering committee and a project management team prior to the acquisition  similar to the approach used by the company 
all dispensing  financial and other systems have now been internally certified as year compliant 
stadtlander  which was acquired on january   has also completed its year remediation efforts and all of its systems have been internally certified as year compliant 
of particular significance is its new billing and receivables software system  which was installed in november and has significantly improved functionality over the previous system  which was not year compliant 
the company also recognizes that it would be at risk if its suppliers  customers  banks  utilities  transportation companies and other business partners fail to properly remediate their year systems and software 
accordingly  the company has communicated with such entities through questionnaires and other means in order to assess the status of their remediation efforts 
the company has met with major business partners to discuss progress and contingencies  conduct on site assessments  and test critical electronic interfaces 
although the company is not aware of any significant year problems with any of these third parties  there can be no assurances that their systems or software will be remediated in a timely manner  or that a remediation failure would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is also subject to risk should government or private payors and insurers fail to become year compliant and therefore be unable to make full or timely reimbursement to the company s customers 
such a situation could have a material adverse affect on the company s cash flows by reducing the ability of customers to pay for products purchased from the company 
in particular  any medicaid or medicare failures would have a significant impact on pharmerica and stadtlander  which directly or indirectly derive a significant portion of their revenues from these state and federal government payors 
the company has charged the cost of its year program to expense as incurred  except for purchases of computer hardware and other equipment  which have been capitalized as property and depreciated over the equipment s estimated useful lives in accordance with the company s normal accounting policies 
through september   the company s cumulative year costs amounted to approximately million including million of capital expenditures 
the company s remaining costs are expected to be approximately million including million of capital expenditures 
the aforementioned amounts exclude the costs associated with new systems installed primarily to integrate operations and achieve additional information technology functionality and the costs associated with the remediation efforts of pharmerica and stadtlander 
from the respective acquisition dates through september   the aggregate year costs of pharmerica and stadtlander amounted to approximately million including million of capital expenditures 
the remaining costs of pharmerica and stadtlander are expected to be approximately million including million of capital expenditures 
the year remediation effort has not had a material impact on the company s daily operations or the development of its information technology systems 
although the aforementioned cost estimates reflect management s best judgment using current information and assumptions about the future  actual costs could vary significantly from the company s estimates due to technological difficulties  the noncompliance of it vendors or other third parties  and by entities that communicate with the company  and other factors 
while the company is not presently aware of any significant exposure due to its systems and software not having been properly remediated  there can be no assurances that all year remediation processes will be successful or that the contingency plans described below will sufficiently mitigate the risk of a year compliance problem 
if year remediation efforts by the company or third parties are unsuccessful  there could be a significant disruption of the company s business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company has identified major potential failure points and the related adverse consequences associated with them 
for such risks  the company has developed contingency plans for conducting its business until the problems can be corrected 
for example  such plans include alternative electronic and manual means of receiving  processing and shipping customer orders  purchasing inventory from suppliers  and sending and receiving cash payments 
the foregoing discussion concerning the year problem contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties referred to above that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
although the company believes that minimal business disruption will occur as a result of year issues  there is no assurance that all year problems will be successfully remediated by the company or third parties and that any such failures will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  the company plans to adopt a new accounting pronouncement issued by the financial accounting standards board 
this pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s reported financial position or results of operations 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s most significant market risk exposure is the effect of changing interest rates 
the company manages its interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at september   the company s debt consisted of approximately million of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of and million of variable rate debt consisting of borrowings under the bank credit agreement and discretionary lines and commercial paper agreements with a weighted average interest rate of 
the amount of the variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company s cash requirements  the amount borrowed at september  represented the maximum borrowings at any quarter end during fiscal if interest rates on such variable debt were to increase by basis points one tenth of the rate at september   the net impact on the company s pre tax earnings would be approximately million 
the company also believes that its interest rate exposure may be somewhat mitigated due to the favorable effect which inflation may have on the company  specifically  manufacturers price inflation which may accelerate concurrent with a general increase in interest rates  to the extent the company can take advantage of such inflation in purchasing and selling inventory
