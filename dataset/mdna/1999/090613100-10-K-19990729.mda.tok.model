these decreases were immaterial and did not affect the company s earnings during the year because foreign currency translation adjustments to balance sheet items are recognized as a component of shareholders equity in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these adjustments are included in comprehensive income in the company s consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
the company will continue to be exposed to the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company expects that operating cash flows in the near future will be primarily determined by levels of net income  working capital requirements and  payments  if any  on outstanding litigaton matters as discussed in note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows used in investing activities were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the primary use for investing activities were purchases of investments and capital equipment  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments

the company understands the importance of utilizing technologically advanced equipment and its ability to produce superior quality products 
the company expects to spend in excess of million over the next two fiscal years for capital expenditures and research and development activities  including a commitment to selective genetics  inc to fund research and development efforts over a ten year period 
the company will continue to expand its research and development activities overseas in the biomaterials field 
funding is expected to come from currently available funds and cash flows generated from future operations 
year yk date conversion the yk issue exists because of the way dates are recorded in many computer dependent products and software programs 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as the year  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process financial and operations information incorrectly 
the company recognized this challenge early and started work in the company s yk strategy to make systems yk compliant includes a common company wide focus on policies  methods and correction tools  and coordination with customers and suppliers 
this focus has been on all systems potentially impacted by the yk issue  including information technology it systems and non it systems  such as embedded systems  facilities and factory floor systems 
each operating unit has responsibility for its own conversion  in line with overall guidance and oversight provided by a corporate level task force 
the majority of the most vital information systems of the company are now yk compliant 
three of the company s european subsidiaries are undergoing computer hardware and software upgrades to ensure yk compliance 
these upgrades will be completed by september the company is presently completing compliancy testing and finalizing contingency plans 
a company wide process to assess key supplier readiness is ongoing 
the company is unable to definitively determine that all key suppliers will reach a yk compliant status that will ensure no production disruption from suppliers 
the company s yk conversion efforts have not been budgeted and tracked as separate projects  but have occurred in conjunction with normal sustaining activities 
these costs are expensed as incurred and are being funded through operating cash flows 
these costs have not had  and are not expected to have  an adverse impact on operating results 
the company believes there is low risk of any internal critical system  embedded system  or other critical asset not being yk compliant by the end of calendar the company continues to assess its risk exposure attributable to external factors  such as suppliers  both domestic and international 
although the company has no reason to conclude that any specific supplier poses a risk  there does exist the possibility of production disruption due to inability of suppliers to deliver critical materials or processes 
the company is unable to quantify such a scenario  but it could result in a material adverse impact on results of operations or financial position of the company 
contingency plans for suppliers and critical systems are being developed to lessen the impact of such a worst case yk scenario 
other matters as more fully described in note l of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company was involved in appeals of adverse jury awards in two separate cases tronzo and orthofix 
in august  the us court of appeals of the federal circuit struck down the million jury award in the tronzo case 
in the orthofix case  on june   the us court of appeals of the third circuit upheld the district court s million compensatory damage award and reduced the punitive damage award from million to million 
the company has recorded a million special charge in its fiscal consolidated financial statements to recognize this adverse judgment 
effective january   of the member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
the company has evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its businesses 
significant areas of potential business impact were identified and appropriate strategies developed 
the company does not believe the costs of the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on future results 
however  the euro conversion may have competitive implications on the company s pricing and marketing strategies  the total impact of which is not known at this time 
the impact of pending accounting pronouncements on the company s financial statements is discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of financing  investment yields and operations of the company 
during fiscal year  biomer cv through its wholly owned financing subsidiary  biomet merck bv obtained a million unsecured line of credit at a major european bank for biomet merck s european operations 
outstanding borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a variable rate of the lender s interbank rate plus 
and  accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s cost of financing 
the company does not have any investments that would be classified as trading securities under generally accepted accounting principles the company s non trading investments  excluding cash and cash equivalents  consist of certificates of deposit  debt securities  equity securities and mortgage backed securities 
the debt securities include municipal bonds  with fixed rates  and preferred stocks  which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
these financial instruments are subject to market risk in that changes in interest rates would impact the market value of such investments 
the company generally does not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which would decrease market values  except for one of its investment managers who utilizes us treasury bond futures options futures options as a protection against the impact of increases in interest rates on the fair value of preferred stocks managed by that investment manager 
the company marks any outstanding futures options to market and market value changes are recognized in current earnings 
the futures options generally have terms ranging from to days 
realized gains on sales of futures options aggregated  for the year ended may   and unrealized losses on outstanding futures options at may   aggregated  based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at may   including variable rate debt and derivatives used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate preferred stocks  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of may   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
the company s foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the european currencies 
the company faces transactional currency exposures that arise when its foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
the company also faces currency exposure that arises from translating the results of its global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
historically  the company has not used financial derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
based on the company s overall exposure for foreign currency at may   a hypothetical percent change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on the company s balance sheet  net sales  net income or cash flows over a one year period
