item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was incorporated in connecticut in and reincorporated in delaware in september historically  the company has derived a majority of its revenues from products other than mercator  primarily its trading partner family of products and its key master product 
however  revenue related to mercator has grown significantly in each of the last three years and has increased as a percentage of total revenues 
the company believes that future growth in revenues  if any  will be mainly attributable to its mercator product line 
the company believes it cannot accurately predict the amount of revenues that will be attributable to this product line or the life of such products 
to the extent the company s mercator products do not maintain continued market acceptance  the company s business  will be adversely affected 
the company s revenues are derived principally from two sources i license fees for the use of the company s software products and ii service fees for maintenance  consulting services and training related to the company s software products 
the company generally recognizes revenue from software license fees upon shipment  unless the company has significant post delivery obligations  in which case revenues are recognized when these obligations are satisfied 
the company s key master product is licensed under term use contracts rather than for a one time license fee  and the company recognizes revenue from these arrangements on a present value basis at the inception of the contract 
the company does not actively market new term use contracts for key master but continues to receive maintenance revenues 
as a result  maintenance revenue accounts for a larger proportion of key master revenue than license revenues and increases the percentage of the company s total revenues represented by services  maintenance and other revenues 
the company intends to continue to increase the scope of its service offerings insofar as it supports the sale of license revenues from sales of its products 
the company believes that software licensing will continue to account for a larger portion of its revenues than service  maintenance and other revenues 
mercator can be used by information technology it professionals as well as value added resellers vars  independent software vendors isvs  software integrators sis or other third parties who resell  embed or otherwise bundle mercator with their products 
to date  license fee revenues have been derived principally from direct sales of software products through the company s direct sales force 
although the company believes that direct sales will continue to account for a significant portion of software licensing revenues  the company intends to increase its use of distributors and resellers 
furthermore  the company s planned expansion of its sales organization is expected to cause sales and marketing expenses to increase 
the company markets its products in north america primarily through its direct sales and telesales organizations 
throughout the rest of the world  the company markets its products through distributors  resellers and direct sales 
international revenue accounted for and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the company maintains an international sales and support office in the united kingdom 
the company intends to increase its international direct sales force by establishing an office in germany and focusing on additional international distributor and reseller relationships 
the size of the company s orders can range from a few thousand dollars to over  per order 
the loss or delay of large individual orders  therefore  can have a significant impact on the revenues and other quarterly results of the company 
in addition  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its quarterly software licensing revenues in the last month of each quarter  and as a result  revenue for any particular quarter may be difficult to predict in advance 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in significant losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenue  the company s operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  operating results for any quarter are subject to variation  and the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
on november   tsi software agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of software consulting partners  or scp 
scp is a professional services organization which provides installation  maintenance and user support consulting services to enterprises utilizing sap software 
the transaction was recorded for accounting purposes as a purchase and was structured to be a tax free reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
in connection with the transaction  tsi software issued scp  shares of its common stock  with of these shares subject to an escrow to secure certain indemnification obligations of scp and a stockholder of scp 
in addition  the company may issue a maximum of an additional  shares of its common stock earnout shares within ten days following the date on which tsi software announces its balance sheet and results of operations for fiscal year the number of earnout shares to be issued will be based upon professional fee revenues generated and the number of employees who are continuously employed that are related to the scp business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
to date  the establishment of technological feasibility of the company s products and general release of such software have substantially coincided 
as a result  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant  and therefore  the company has not capitalized any software development costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items from the company s statements of operations

taxes at december   the company had remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that all of its federal net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized  accordingly  the company reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes which resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit for the year ending december  due to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  the provision for income taxes in was insignificant 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues total revenues

taxes due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  the provisions for income taxes for and were not significant 
at december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  all of which expire through due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits to offset federal taxable income in future periods could be subject to an annual limitation if a change in ownership for income tax purposes should occur

in  cash provided by operations was million compared to cash used of  in net accounts receivable were million at december  compared to million at december  the number of days of average revenues in accounts receivables was at december  compared to at december  the increase in accounts receivable is due to the increase in sales billed during the last month of the quarter as compared to  the increase in deferred revenue and the granting of extended terms for certain customers 
capital expenditures have been  and future capital expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily for facilities  equipment and computer software to support expansion of the company s operations 
additions to property  plant and equipment accounted for  and  for and  respectively 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances  and net cash generated by operations  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s operating requirements  the company may seek additional debt or equity financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
in an effort to best utilize its working capital  the company intends to pursue the development and acquisition of additional products or businesses which support the current business needs 
although the company is continually considering and evaluating opportunities for future growth  the company has no agreements or understandings with respect to any material acquisitions 
year readiness disclosure awareness  the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty first century dates because such systems may have been developed using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this error could result in system failures  generation of erroneous data or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such year requirements 
the year problem is pervasive and complex 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential impact of year problems 
the company is assessing the potential overall impact of the impending century change on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
state of readiness  based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes the current versions of its software products and services are year compliant that is  they are capable of adequately distinguishing twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
new products are being designed to be year compliant 
although the company s products have undergone  or will undergo  the company s normal quality testing procedures  there can  however  be no assurance that the company s products will contain all necessary date code changes 
furthermore  use of the company s products in connection with other products which are not year compliant  including non compliant hardware  software and firmware may result in the inaccurate exchange of dates and result in performance problems or system failure 
in addition  oem derivative versions of older products may not be year compliant 
any failure of the company s products to perform  including system malfunctions associated with the onset of year  could result in claims against the company 
however  success of the company s year compliance efforts may depend on the success of its customers in dealing with the year issue 
we have issued disclosure statements to all our existing customers and have posted these statements on our website 
although the company has not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date that involves year compliance issues with its products or services  it could be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  regardless of the merits of such disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  excluding consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company believes that purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers of the company may be affected by year compliance issues as organizations expend significant resources to correct their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funding available to such entities for other information technology purchases  such as those products and services offered by the company 
furthermore  customers and potential customers may defer information technology purchases generally until early in the next millennium to avoid year compliance problems 
any such deferral of purchases by the company s customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s business depends on numerous systems that could potentially be impacted by year related problems 
those systems include  among others hardware and software systems used by the company to deliver products and services to its customers including software supplied by third parties  communications networks such as the wide area network and local area networks upon which the company depends to communicate product orders to its manufacturing and distribution operations and to develop products  the internal systems of the company s customers and suppliers  software products sold to customers  the hardware and software systems used internally by the company in the management of its business  and non information technology systems and services used by the company in the management of its business  such as power  telephone systems and building systems 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure in order to identify and modify any products  services or systems that are not year compliant 
based on its initial analysis of the systems potentially impacted by conduct business in the twenty first century  the company is applying a phased approach to making such systems  and accordingly  the company s operations  ready for the year beyond awareness of the issues and scope of systems involved  the phases of activities in process include an assessment of specific underlying computer systems  programs and hardware  renovation or replacement of year non compliant technology  validation and testing of critical systems certified by third party suppliers to be year compliant  and implementation of year compliant systems 
the table below describes the status and timing of such phased activities impacted systems targeted assessment status completion software products sold to customers existing products software products q tested and available completed for distribution new products ongoing hardware and software assessment in process q systems used to deliver products and services communication networks used assessment in progress q to carry products and provide services hardware and software assessment in progress q systems used to manage the company s business hardware and software validation  testing q systems used to deliver and remediation products and services communication networks used validation  testing q to carry products and and remediation provide services hardware and software validation  testing q systems used to manage and remediation the company s business non information technology systems upgraded or q systems and services replaced as appropriate  testing and implementation extensive year testing will be conducted on all systems considered critical to the company 
to date  the company has not encountered any material problems in this regard with its computer systems or any other equipment that might be subject to such problems 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
this could result in system failures or generation of erroneous information and could cause significant disruption to business activities 
the company is reviewing what further actions are required to make all software systems used internally year compliant as well as actions needed to mitigate vulnerability to problems with suppliers and other third parties systems 
such actions include a review of vendor contracts and formal communication with suppliers to request certification that products are year compliant 
cost to address year issues  the total cost of these year compliance activities has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
these costs and the timing in which the company plans to complete its year modification and testing processes are based on management s estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will timely identify and remedy all significant year problems  that remediation efforts will not involve significant time and expense  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingency plan  the company does not presently have a formal contingency plan for handling year problems that are not detected and corrected prior to their occurrence  although the company has identified specific individuals to address and resolve any year related issues 
conversion to a single european currency the company has sales in a number of foreign countries 
however  as the majority of foreign sales are in the uk  conversion to a single european currency would not have a material impact on the company s financial results 
factors that may affect future results tsi software depends on it s mercator product line 
the company introduced its mercator products in in recent years  a significant and increasing portion of the company s revenue has been attributable to licenses of its mercator products and related services  and the company expects that revenues attributable to mercator will represent an increasing portion of the company s total revenue for the foreseeable future 
the development and marketing of its mercator product line has required the company to  among other things  focus its attention and resources away from some of its traditional products  market its products to a different customer base and shift a large portion of its development efforts to the mercator product line 
accordingly  the company s future operating results are highly dependent on the market acceptance and growth of its mercator product line and enhancements to this line 
market acceptance of the mercator product line may not increase or remain at current levels 
the company may not be able to successfully market the mercator product line and develop extensions and enhancements to this product line on a long term basis 
in the event the company s current or future competitors release new products that provide  or are perceived as providing  more advanced features  greater functionality  better performance  better compatibility with other systems or lower prices than the mercator product line  demand for the company s products and services would likely decline 
see risks associated with technological change  product enhancements and new product development and competition 
a decline in demand for  or market acceptance of  the mercator product line as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
tsi software depends on sap r system implementations 
a substantial portion of the company s sales of its mercator products and related services has been attributable to sales of mercator for r and related services 
the company believes that its future revenue growth  if any  will also depend in significant part upon continued sales of mercator for r and related services 
the company has devoted and must continue to devote substantial resources to identifying potential customers in the r market  building strategic relationships and attracting and retaining skilled technical  sales and professional services personnel with expertise in r systems 
personnel with expertise in the r system are in high demand and as such are typically difficult to hire and retain 
regardless of the investments the company makes in pursuing this new market  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing a sales and marketing strategy appropriate for this market or in attracting and retaining the necessary skilled personnel 
demand for and market acceptance of mercator for r and related services will be dependent on the continued market acceptance of the sap r system 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting demand for or use of sap s r system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
implementation of the sap r system is a costly and time consuming process and there can be no assurance that businesses will choose to purchase such systems 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that businesses which may implement such systems will wish to commit the additional resources required to implement mercator for r in addition  sap could in the future introduce business application integration solutions competitive with mercator for r and related services 
moreover  any changes in or new versions of sap s r system could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition if the company were not able to successfully develop or implement any related changes to mercator for r in a timely fashion 
the company will also be required to maintain ale  edi and dmi certifications for mercator for r in order to maintain such certification  the company s product must adhere to sap s technical specifications which are updated by sap from time to time  and the company has no control over whether and when such specifications will be changed 
any material change by sap in such specifications could require the company to devote significant development resources to updating this product to comply with such specifications 
in such event  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully modify mercator for r on a timely basis  if at all  and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company may  in the future  seek to develop and market enhancements to existing products or new products which are targeted for applications  systems or platforms which the company believes will achieve commercial acceptance 
these efforts could require the company to devote significant development and sales and marketing personnel as well as other resources to such efforts which would otherwise be available for other purposes 
the company may not be able to successfully identify such applications  systems or platforms 
also these applications  systems or platforms will achieve commercial acceptance or company may not realize a sufficient return on its investment 
in addition  the introduction or announcement by the company  or by one or more of its current or future competitors  of products embodying new technologies or features could render the company s existing products obsolete or unmarketable dependence upon development of distribution channels 
an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand both its direct sales force and its indirect sales channels such as value added resellers or vars  independent software vendors or isvs  systems integrators or sis and distributors 
although vars  isvs  sis and distributors have not accounted for a substantial percentage of the company s total revenues historically  the company is increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding its indirect distribution channels 
tsi software may not be successful in expanding the number of indirect distribution channels for its products 
furthermore  any new vars  isvs  sis or distributors may offer competing products  or have no minimum purchase requirements of the company s products 
these third parties may also not provide adequate levels of services and technical support 
the inability of the company to enter into additional indirect distribution arrangements  the failure of these third parties to perform under agreements with the company and to penetrate their markets  or the inability of the company to retain and manage vars  isvs  sis and distributors with the technical and industry expertise required to market the company s products successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s planned efforts to expand its use of vars  isvs  sis and distributors may not be successful 
to the extent that the company is successful in increasing its sales through indirect sales channels  it expects that those sales will be at lower per unit prices than sales through direct channels 
therefore revenue to the company for each such sale will be less than if the company had licensed the same product to the customer directly 
selling through indirect channels may limit the company s contacts with its customers 
as a result  the company s ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
the company s strategy of marketing its products directly to end users and indirectly through vars  isvs  sis and distributors may also result in distribution channel conflicts 
the company s direct sales efforts may compete with those of its indirect channels and  to the extent different resellers target the same customers  resellers may also come into conflict with each other 
although the company has attempted to manage its distribution channels to avoid potential conflicts  channel conflicts could materially and adversely affect its relationships with existing vars  isvs  sis or distributors or adversely affect its ability to attract new vars  isvs  sis and distributors 
management of growth 
the growth of the company s business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on the company s administrative  financial  sales and operational resources and increased demands on its systems and controls 
in particular  the company noted an increase in days sales outstanding from december  to december  from approximately days to approximately days  and an increase in total accounts receivable from million to million 
accounts receivable dsos were higher at december  versus december  due to an increase of maintenance billings  an increase in deferred revenue where amounts have been billed and revenue will be recognized in future periods  and a higher proportion of new sales billed during the last month of the company s fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the company has implemented or is in the process of implementing and will be required to implement in the future a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls and to hire additional administrative personnel 
tsi software may not be able to complete the implementation of these systems  procedures and controls or hire such personnel in a timely manner 
the failure of the company or its management to respond to  and manage  its growth and changing business conditions  or to adapt its operational  management and financial control systems to accommodate its growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
to promote growth in the company s sales and operations  the company will also continue to expand its sales and marketing organizations  expand and develop its distribution channels  fund increasing levels of product development and increase the size of its training  professional services and customer support organization to accommodate expanded operations 
the company may not be successful in these endeavors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tsi is exposed to market risk primarily through its investments in marketable securities 
tsi s investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk instruments 
as of december   investments in marketable securities was million 
due to the nature of these investments  any decrease in rates would not have material impact on the company s financial statements
