overview pervasive software inc is a leading provider of application development and deployment software that dramatically simplifies the development  deployment and maintenance of web based and client server applications 
our comprehensive  integrated suite of software products includes development and deployment products  and high performance zero administration databases  combined  these products offer a unique solution that simplifies the development  deployment and maintenance of web based and client server applications and lowers the cost of ownership of web based and client server distributed computing environments 
our business model leverages a channel of software developers  application service providers  web and systems integrators  and value added resellers around the world 
we derive our revenues primarily from shrink wrap licenses through independent software vendors  value added resellers and distributors and through oem license agreements with independent software vendors 
shrink wrap license fees are variable and based generally on user count  or in the case of tango  number of application servers 
our oem licensing program offers independent software vendors volume discounts and specialized technical support  training and consulting in exchange for integrating our products in packaged applications and paying us a royalty based on sales of the applications 
additionally  we generate revenues from version upgrades  user count upgrades  and from upgrades to client server environments from single user workstation or workgroup environments 
we generally recognize revenues from software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we generally recognize revenues related to agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees when we deliver the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
we recognize per copy royalties in excess of a fixed minimum amount as revenues when such amounts are reported to us 
we operate with virtually no order backlog because our software products are shipped shortly after orders are received 
this makes product revenues in any quarter substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
we reserve for estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights  as well as for uncollectable accounts based on experience 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from our pervasive 
sql and btrieve data management products 
on june   we discontinued general availability of our btrieve products to consolidate our development  marketing and technical support resources behind our current tango and pervasive 
sql products 
accordingly  we expect that our revenue from the license of tango and pervasive 
sql will account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future as revenue from the license of btrieve will decline substantially over time 
our future operating results will depend upon continued market acceptance of pervasive 
sql and our ability to develop and market our tango products 
pervasive 
sql may not achieve continued market acceptance  and tango may not achieve market acceptance at all 
any decrease in demand or market acceptance for our pervasive 
sql product would have a damaging effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in february  we launched a marketing program in which we began offering the tango development environment for free through may this program was intended to encourage developers to build applications on the tango platform as a seeding strategy for tango application server licenses 
we cannot be certain that this marketing program or future marketing programs will successfully generate license revenue from our tango products 
on november   we acquired of the outstanding stock of everyware development inc  everyware and acquired the remaining outstanding shares in december  for total consideration of million  including cash paid to the everyware shareholders  transaction costs and the value of stock options assumed 
the transaction was recorded using the purchase accounting method 
the following table presents the allocation of the purchase price in thousands software technology  purchased research and development  excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired  deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired net fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in december  we granted novell  inc  a non exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable license to reproduce and distribute a two user version of pervasive 
sql for distribution in combination with other products distributed by novell 
novell is currently distributing our two user version in a service release and we believe novell may begin general distribution in the fall of we will not receive any royalties directly from novell related to the agreement 
we do believe  however  that we may receive fees in the future by licensing multi user upgrades for some of the two user versions distributed by novell 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of operations 
the results of operations of everyware subsequent to november  are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  year ended june  revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired charge for purchased research and development total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in earnings of subsidiary net income supplemental disclosures operating income  excluding certain charges net income  excluding certain charges amounts for the year ended june  exclude a charge for purchased research and development of million  or of revenue  and amortization of excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired of  or of revenue 
revenues we generated revenues of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  an increase of from fiscal to  and from fiscal to we attributed this revenue increase in each period to increased market acceptance of our products operating on windows nt  the introduction of pervasive 
sql in february and ongoing expansion of our worldwide sales organization 
although our revenues have increased in recent periods  we cannot be certain that revenues will grow in future periods  that they will grow at past rates or that we will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
licenses of our software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems increased to approximately of our revenues in fiscal from approximately in fiscal and in fiscal licenses of our software operating on netware represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in and in we believe that the increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to licenses of our products operating on windows nt and other microsoft operating systems is due to two factors the increased market acceptance of our products operating on microsoft platforms and the increased market penetration of microsoft platforms relative to other operating systems 
we expect that the percentages of our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time 
we cannot be certain that our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future  or at all 
international revenues  consisting of all revenues from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we attribute the increase in each period primarily to expansion of our international sales organization  first in europe and then in japan 
we believe that revenues from international markets represent a significant opportunity 
therefore  we expect that international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future as we expand internationally  primarily in europe and japan  but also in other areas of the world 
costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support 
cost of revenues and technical support consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products and the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  which is typically provided within days of purchase and license fees for third parties technologies embedded in our products 
cost of revenues and technical support was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing   and of revenues  respectively 
cost of revenues and technical support increased in each period due to increased sales volume and increased technical support and service personnel in the us  europe and japan 
we anticipate that cost of revenues and technical support will continue to increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in the future as we expand our international operations  incur increased license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products  provide technical support for additional products and invest in personnel to deliver professional services and training services to others 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced sales and marketing expenditures 
sales and marketing expenses increased in dollar amount each period primarily due to increased costs associated with hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  the promotion of pervasive 
sql  market development activities for tango and increased infrastructure costs associated with foreign sales office expansion 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as we aggressively invest in the market development activities for tango and promote pervasive 
sql  hire additional sales and marketing personnel and continue to expand our international operations 
sales and marketing expenses are likely to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to the timing and extent of tango market development activities and costs associated with new product releases  marketing promotions  brand awareness campaigns  lead generation programs and international expansion 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in dollar amount each period primarily due to the increased hiring of and or contracting with additional research and development personnel 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and that such expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount  however such expenses are likely to continue to fluctuate as a percent of revenue due to the timing of costs associated with future product releases 
software development costs that were eligible for capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
were insignificant during these periods 
accordingly  we charged all software development costs to research and development expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the personnel and other costs of our finance  human resources  information systems and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
we attribute the increase in dollar amount in each period primarily to the increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations  both domestically and internationally 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue in each period primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced general and administrative expenditures 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount in the future as our administrative staff expands to support our growing worldwide operations 
charge for purchased research and development 
we acquired of the capital stock of everyware development inc in november  and acquired the remaining outstanding shares in december  for total consideration of million  including cash paid to the everyware shareholders  transaction costs and the value of employee stock options assumed 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
we hired an independent third party appraisal company to determine the valuation of the intangible assets acquired 
the valuation allocated the purchase price as follows million attributed to purchased research and development  million attributed to current technology  and  attributed to the assembled workforce 
we charged to operations million in purchased research and development in the quarter ended december   because the underlying research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
we are using the purchased research and development to complete new products that have  and in some cases will  become part of our product lines subsequent to the acquisition 
we believe these new products will include new technology that furthers the extensibility  ease of use  productivity and performance of our web application server and web development and deployment solutions  as well as new integrated tools and utilities for administration and analysis 
we expect that substantially all the purchased research and development will reach technological feasibility  but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability of these products will actually be achieved 
if commercial viability is not achieved  we would look to other alternatives to provide these solutions 
we do not believe that a delay in providing such alternative solutions would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated the time to be incurred to transform the purchased research and development into commercially viable products as approximately man months or approximately  the nature of the efforts required to complete development of the purchased research and development into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
an independent third party appraiser determined the value assigned to purchased research and development 
this third party appraiser projected cash flows related to future products expected to be derived once technological feasibility is achieved  including costs to complete the development of technology and the future revenues and costs which are expected to result from commercialization of the products 
projected cash flows from the core technology and other supporting assets were discounted back to their present value at a rate of for one project and for another project 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of revenues  cost of revenues and technical support  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses and income taxes resulting from such projects 
our estimates were based on expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of completion of purchased research and development 
nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe substantial changes need to be made to the underlying assumptions 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was approximately  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively  before considering the impact of the charge for purchased research and development 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year and fiscal increased primarily due to foreign taxes associated with our increased operations overseas and non deductible amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of everyware 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
these factors include 
limited history of operating profits in the company s canadian subsidiary  
the potential impact of anticipated deductions due to exercise of employee stock options on deferred tax assets with limited carryforward periods  
recent increases in expense levels to support our growth  and 
the intensely competitive market in which we operate and which is subject to rapid change 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the canadian subsidiary and to the extent domestic deferred tax assets exceed the potential benefit from carryback or carryover of deferred items to offset taxable income in the current year  prior years or the next succeeding year 
we expect our effective tax rate will increase in the future as our domestic deferred tax asset is substantially realized 
quarterly results from operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k and believe that all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below and present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of everyware are included in the quarterly results beginning with the acquisition date  november  the data for the december  quarter includes a charge relating to the acquisition of everyware for purchased research and development of million

amounts for the quarters ended march  and june  exclude amortization of excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired of  and  or of total revenues in each period  and have the effect of and per diluted share  respectively 
due to the nature and magnitude of these expenses  we believe disclosure of the supplemental operations data is relevant to investors  but is not intended to be a substitute for amounts reflected in our audited financial statements 
in addition  the supplemental operations data may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
for example  we incurred a loss in the quarter ended december  as a result of a write off associated with our acquisition of everyware development inc liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash generated by operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable consistent with the increased sales volume during fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from increased earnings  excluding a non cash charge for purchased research and development and amortization expense related to the acquisition of everyware 
during fiscal and  we invested million and million  respectively  in marketable securities  consisting of various taxable and tax advantaged securities 
in addition  we purchased property and equipment totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for our growing employee base and approximately million for furniture and fixtures and improvements related to our new facility 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase as our employee base grows 
in march  we completed a secondary offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriter s discount and expenses of the offering 
in november  we acquired of the outstanding stock of everyware development inc  and acquired the remaining outstanding shares in december we financed the acquisition by using available funds of approximately million during the quarter ended december  in february  we acquired smithware  inc a developer of database development and reporting components for pervasive products 
we acquired smithware for approximately  consisting of  in cash   shares of our common stock valued at  and acquisition costs of  plus up to an additional  of cash and  shares of common stock payable upon achievement of certain milestones in the future 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we repaid smithware s outstanding debts of approximately  in fiscal  we paid  in cash and issued  shares of our common stock valued at  to the former smithware shareholders upon achieving the first two milestones specified in the acquisition agreement 
in february  we purchased an additional ownership interest in our majority owned subsidiary  pervasive software co  ltd 
formerly known as btrieve technologies japan  ltd  by acquiring stock held by minority shareholders for approximately  in cash 
following this purchase  we hold of the outstanding stock of pervasive software co  ltd 
in september  we completed an initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriter s discount and expenses of the offering 
we have entered into licensing agreements with two vendors and anticipate entering into a licensing agreement with a third vendor related to technology included  or to be included  with our internally developed products which require fixed minimum license payments totalling million for the year ended june  and  for each of the years ended june  and these license agreements provide for use of the technologies on a perpetual basis or for fixed periods of time 
on june   we had million in working capital including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
we have a million revolving line of credit with a bank  but have at no time borrowed under such line 
our line of credit contains certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters including our ability to pay cash dividends and effect mergers or acquisitions without the bank s prior approval 
we are currently in compliance with such financial covenants and restrictions 
we have granted a first priority security interest in substantially all of our tangible assets as security for our obligations under our credit lines 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  issued statement of position  software revenue recognition  which changes the requirements for revenue recognition 
in march  the aicpa issued sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  software revenue recognition 
we adopted sop and sop in fiscal the effect of such adoption was not significant 
in december  the aicpa issued statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop amends sop to extend the deferral of the application of certain passages of sop provided by sop through fiscal years beginning on or before march  all other provisions of sop are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning march  we believe that the adoption of sop will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the statement supersedes the disclosure requirements in statements no 
 employers accounting for pensions  no 
 accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
statement revises the required disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
we believe that the adoption of statement will have no affect on our results of operations  financial position or disclosures in the future 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers for one year the effective date of statement statement is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after our fiscal year we do not anticipate that the adoption of statement will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position because of our minimal use of derivatives 
year compliance the year issue results from an industry wide practice of representing years with only two digits instead of four 
beginning in the year  date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates or 
as a result  in the coming months  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
our year readiness plan for our current versions of pervasive 
sql  pervasive 
sql  btrieve v  odbc interface v  tango v and tango v includes the following 
assessment take an inventory of products to be tested  survey third party programs utilized  generate compliance plan  and define what compliance will mean  
implementation devise upgrades to correct any year issues  
validation test and debug current versions of products  and 
contingency planning plan to implement in the event that we do not achieve year compliance by january  we have completed all phases of our plan with respect to the current versions of all of our products 
based on our review  each of the current versions of our products was found to have no known year limitations  when configured and used in accordance with the related documentation  and provided that the underlying operating system of the host machine and any other software used with or in the host machine are also year compliant 
an earlier release of scalable sql and certain other discontinued products were not designed to be year compliant 
however  the product documentation for these earlier products did describe how to utilize the products in a manner which would support four digit entries 
earlier versions of our products have not been tested for year compliance as these earlier versions of our products are no longer supported by us 
we recommend upgrading to the current version of our products if customers have any concerns 
we have defined year compliant as the ability to 
correctly handle date information needed for the transition from december  to january   
function according to the product documentation provided for this date change  without changes in operation resulting from the approaching new century  assuming correct configuration  
where appropriate  respond to two digit date input in a way that resolves the ambiguity as to century in a disclosed  defined  and predetermined manner  
if the date elements in interfaces and data storage specify the century  store and provide output of date information in ways that are unambiguous as to century  and 
recognize year as a leap year 
we do not currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of our customers or third party vendors who embed or resell our products 
third party applications that utilize our products may still be written in a manner that does not take advantage of the year capabilities of our products 
if our current or future customers fail to achieve year compliance or if they divert technology expenditures away from software products such as those offered by us to address year issues  our business  operating results  or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have not specifically tested software licensed from third parties that is marketed through our channel  but we have received warranties and representations from our vendors that the licensed software is year compliant 
despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  and assurances from developers of products incorporated into our products  our products may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
unknown errors or defects in our products could result in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
some commentators have predicted significant litigation regarding year compliance issues 
because of the nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent we may be affected by it 
our internal systems include both our information technology and non it systems such as our security system  building equipment  and embedded microcontrollers 
our year compliance project has assessed our material internal it systems and our non it systems 
the project encompasses two major areas of our internal it structure the technical services area  including all hardware  operating system  and standard application issues  and the applications area  including all corporate database  accounting and custom applications 
to the extent that we are not able to test the technology provided by third party vendors  we are seeking assurances from such vendors that their systems are year compliant 
although we are not currently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing our internal it and non it systems for the year  we may experience material unanticipated problems and costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in such systems 
undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal it and non it systems could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we have funded our year plan from operating cash flows and have not separately accounted for these costs in the past  nor do we have specific dollars budgeted for the project as the costs are not considered to be material 
we have not yet fully developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if we are unable to achieve year compliance of any of our critical operations 
the cost of developing and implementing such a plan may itself be material 
finally  we are also subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation company year compliance failures and related service interruptions 
the costs associated with any such external forces could be material 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of its transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  the company does have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  the company has operations in japan  germany  france  ireland  england  belgium  hong kong and canada and conducts transactions in the local currency of each location 
in fiscal the us dollar weakened against the japanese yen 
had the us dollar to japanese yen rate remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million and  respectively 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies was not material for fiscal the company monitors its foreign currency exposure and  from time to time will attempt to reduce its exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for years ended june   and pervasive is subject to interest rate risk on its cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as the company s investment policy requires the company to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
