purchased in process r d includes the value of products in the development stage and not considered to have reached technological feasibility 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  purchased in process r d is required to be expensed 
the value assigned to purchased in process r d  based on a valuation prepared by an independent third party appraisal company  was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  including arthroscopic resection and procedure specific surgical instruments  imaging technology for minimally invasive surgical procedures  specialty surgical powered instruments  and other 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of

additionally  during the first quarter of  the company recorded a non cash extraordinary charge related to the write off of deferred financing fees 
operating cash flow for was positively impacted by increases in accounts payable and accrued interest  and a reduction in the net deferred income tax asset 
adversely impacting operating cash flows in was an increase in accounts receivable and inventories primarily as a result of the timing of conmed s assumption of linvatec s international operations previously managed by zimmer 
in connection with the linvatec acquisition  conmed assumed responsibility for the majority of linvatec s international operation on july  accordingly  the receivables and inventory of the international operations were not acquired or funded by conmed until the second half of net cash used by investing activities in included million paid related to the arthroscopy product line acquisition from minnesota mining and manufacturing company and million of payments related to the linvatec and davol acquisitions

upon the application of mandatory principal payments including the subordinated note proceeds  the company s term loans at december  aggregated million and are repayable quarterly over remaining terms of four and six years 
the company s credit facility also includes a million revolving credit facility which expires december  of which million was available on december  the borrowings under the credit facility carry interest rates based on a spread over libor or an alternative base interest rate 
the covenants of the credit facility provide for increase and decrease to this interest rate spread based on the operating results of the company 
additionally  certain events of default under the credit facility limit interest rate options available to the company 
the weighted average interest rates at december  under the term loans and the revolving credit facility were and  respectively 
additionally  during the commitment period  the company is obligated to pay a fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate swaps  a form of derivative  are used to manage interest rate risk 
currently  the company has entered into two interest rate swaps expiring in june which convert million of floating rate debt under the company s credit facility into fixed rate debt at rates ranging from to 
provisions in one of the interest rate swaps cancels such agreement when libor exceeds 
the credit facility is collateralized by all the company s personal property 
the credit facility contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require maintenance of certain working capital levels and financial ratios  prohibit dividend payments and restrict the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
the company is also required to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issue of equity and asset sales and also from any excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company s operating results will meet excess cash flow provisions of the credit agreement and  accordingly  the company expects to make mandatory prepayments on the term loans of approximately million by march  the significant portion of the prepayment amount will be borrowed under the company s revolving credit facility 
coincident with this mandatory prepayment  it is expected that the interest rate on the term loans and revolving credit facility will be reduced by the notes are in aggregate principal amount of million and have a maturity date of march  the notes bear interest at per annum which is payable semi annually 
the indenture governing the notes has certain restrictive covenants and provides for  among other things  mandatory and optional redemptions by the company 
the credit facility and notes are guaranteed the subsidiary guarantees by each of the company s subsidiaries in existence on the closing dates of the credit facility and the notes the subsidiary guarantors 
the subsidiary guarantees provide that each subsidiary guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the company s obligations on a joint and several basis 
each subsidiary guarantor is wholly owned by the company 
under the credit facility and subordinated note indenture  the company s subsidiaries are subject to the same covenants and restrictions that apply to the company except that the subsidiary guarantors are permitted to make dividend payments and distributions  including cash dividend payments  to the company or another subsidiary guarantor 
management believes that cash generated from operations  its current cash resources and funds available under its credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to ensure continued working capital for operations  debt service and funding of capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
year the company and its subsidiaries use information technology it and non it systems that contain embedded technology throughout their businesses 
third parties with which the company has material relationships also use such systems 
after december   these systems will face a potentially serious problem if they are not able to recognize and correctly process dates beyond december  all of the company s products  operations and information technology systems have been inventoried and those that are not year ready have been identified 
the upgrading and testing of those which are not year ready is on schedule to be completed by june  the company is also in the process of contacting its vendors and customers to ascertain their preparation for the year issue and is in the process of identifying critical business partners for which the need for additional due diligence will be assessed 
the costs of the company s year assessment and remediation program have not been and are not expected to be material 
although the company does not expect the year issue to have a material effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition  failure of critical it and non it systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
further  the company cannot eliminate the risk that revenue will be lost or costs will be incurred as a result of the failure by third parties to properly remediate their year issues 
because the company has not identified any areas of its own or its third parties it and non it systems that will not be year compliant  it has not yet developed any necessary contingency plans

an additional risk with respect to the company s european operations relates to the conversion of certain european countries to a common currency which began january  the euro conversion 
the company has formed an internal task force to evaluate the risks and implement any required actions with respect to the euro conversion 
based on the analysis of this task force  the company does not believe that the costs to the company to convert to a common currency will be material 
additionally the company does not believe that there will be any material impact from a competitive point of view with respect to the impact of the euro conversion on the sales of products
