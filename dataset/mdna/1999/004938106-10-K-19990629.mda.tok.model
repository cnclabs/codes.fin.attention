results of operations net sales change change dollars in thousands net sales    fiscal compared to fiscal net sales to the company s americas dealer network during the year ended march  increased when compared to the previous year 
net sales to the americas dealer network represented and of total net sales in the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in net sales in the americas dealer channel as a percentage of total net sales is attributable to the continued success of the company s strategic partner relationships as some dealers purchase the company s products through these partners rather than directly from the company 
the company feels this is an efficient method of distributing its basic voice mail products  due to lower distribution and product support costs 
the increase in overall revenue in the dealer channel when compared to the prior year is attributable to the incremental sales provided by the company s year yk program  which provides discounts to dealers who upgrade their customers non yk compliant systems 
to a lesser extent  the introduction of new switch integrations and additional features for repartee  and the first full year of sales of the lingo product  also contributed to the revenue increase in the channel 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  the company released unity to general availability for all customers 
revenues from unity were not material for the year ended march  net sales to the company s corporate sales channel increased during the year ended march  over the comparable period in the prior fiscal year 
net sales to corporate sales customers represented and of total net sales for the fiscal years and  respectively 
inswitch and repartee replay plus product revenues accounted for the majority of the increase in net sales to corporate sales customers 
inswitch was introduced during the second half of fiscal year and the benefit of a full year s sales in fiscal resulted in a five fold increase in inswitch revenue 
sales of the inswitch product benefited from the success of nec s electraelite switch sales  a high percentage of which are now sold with voice mail 
in fiscal  the corporate sales channel also experienced growth in replay lingo product revenue  and year over year revenue from all major strategic partners increased 
the company reached an agreement with alcatel in the quarter ended march  to jointly develop and deliver a fully customized unity based product to alcatel customers 
as of march  the company had significant strategic partner relationships 
the largest corporate customer represented of total corporate sales  and of total company net sales 
net sales to international customers grew in the year ended march  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
international sales represented and of total net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in international sales can be partially attributed to the success of the international rollout of the company s lingo product  particularly in the united kingdom and australia pacific markets 
in addition  the company has continued to successfully supply replay systems to crane in the united kingdom 
the company s sales in the asia pacific region continued to struggle due to the effects of the weak asian economy in the first half of the year but began to improve during the second half of fiscal the company continues to see the positive results of its product localization efforts for various european countries  as evidenced by the increase in replay and replay plus units shipped there 
the company continues to increase its volume of business with phillips  and anticipates further development of this relationship with the release of an inswitch product to phillips in fiscal recent developments in the international channel include the opening of new sales offices in south africa and sweden 
beyond the usual risks associated with international sales currency fluctuations and restrictions  export import regulations  customs matters  foreign collection problems  and military  political and transportation risks  the company s international sales involve additional governmental regulation  product adaptations to local languages and switching systems  and uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations 
other revenue comprised of the company s fiscal net sales  compared to in fiscal this increase primarily represents revenue contributed from the company s pronexus subsidiary  which grew in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company experiences significant quarterly variability in the level of sales through its three distinct distribution channels 
the diversification provided by these three channels has in the past reduced the quarterly volatility of aggregate net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal effective april   the company s south and central american customers  which were previously under the umbrella of international sales  joined with the north american dealer channel to create the americas dealer channel 
due to the rearrangement of the sales channels and the desire to offer consistent data when compared to the prior year s form k  the figures are not directly comparable to the figures 
however  the numbers have been restated to reflect the change in the americas channel in the fiscal compared to fiscal narrative  but the numbers were not restated in the fiscal compared to fiscal discussion 
this allows the relationships to be examined by comparing fiscal to  and fiscal to net sales to the company s north american dealer network during the year ended march  declined when compared to the previous year 
net sales to the north american dealer network represented and of total net sales in the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales to the north american dealer channel as a percentage of total net sales is partially attributable to a shift in the distribution of the company s low end products to the corporate sales channel 
the decrease can also be attributed to the delayed release of repartee vp and cti in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company discounted certain interim sales of replay and replay plus products  which were phased out in this channel with the introduction of repartee vp and cti 
the delay also caused customers to defer orders in anticipation of the new repartee product offering 
it is anticipated that the standardization of the code base offered by repartee vp and cti will simplify the product offering by establishing a consistent feature set and the ability to offer more telephone switch integrations 
this transition also allows the company to offer telanophy capability to every repartee product sold in the channel 
the introduction of lingo helped to mitigate the overall revenue decline  of the new dealers the company added in fiscal  were specifically devoted to selling lingo 
net sales to the company s corporate sales channel increased during the year ended march  over the prior fiscal year 
net sales to corporate sales customers represented and of total net sales for the fiscal years and  respectively 
a greater than increase in the unit sales of repartee was a significant factor in this year over year change 
the release of the high unit volume inswitch product during the third quarter of fiscal more than offset the year over year decline in replay systems revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company successfully launched lingo to a strategic partner  broadening the product offerings in the channel and contributing to the increase in revenue 
the company also reached an agreement with ingram micro in the quarter ended march  to distribute repartee and lingo  and to develop a sales channel for the release of the company s forthcoming nt based product 
as of march  the company had significant strategic partner relationships 
the largest corporate customer represented of the channel s sales  and of total company revenue during the year ended march  net sales to international customers grew in the year ended march  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
international sales represented and of total net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in international sales can be attributed to the evolution of the company s international strategy towards a decentralized approach  providing the local sales managers the latitude to take advantage of the unique opportunities in their markets 
the acquisition of active voice bv  the company s european distributor  in september allowed the company to improve its responsiveness to its european customers 
the company continued to invest in product localization efforts  especially in the german and french markets 
the international channel also experienced an increase in revenue from replay  offset by declining unit sales of repartee systems and kits 
the strength of the us currency  particularly relative to the australian dollar  mitigated some of the overall increase in international revenues 
other revenue comprised of the company s fiscal net sales  compared to in fiscal this increase primarily represents revenue contributed from the company s pronexus subsidiary  acquired in january the company also recognized revenues for the receipt of patent license fees related to the company s stutter detect patent 
gross profit change change dollars in thousands gross profit    percentage of net sales the company s gross margin varies in part depending upon the mix of higher margin voice board and software kit sales offered to all customers and software only sales  such as inswitch available only to strategic partner accounts as opposed to turnkey system sales which include the cost of a pc and other related hardware 
the proportion of sales contributed from each distribution channel also affects the overall gross margin  as international sales have historically had higher gross margins than sales through the other distribution channels 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from the company s yk upgrade program has contributed to the reduction of the overall gross margin percentage in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
the pc hardware components of the company s products carry a lower gross margin percentage  and the pc hardware component is greater under the yk program than in the company s non yk business 
another factor contributing to the decline is the continuing shift of a larger portion of the company s revenue through the strategic partner channel  which has resulted in increased unit volume at the expense of higher margin percentages 
specifically  the company s lingo sales  which contributed a higher proportion of margin dollars in fiscal than the prior fiscal year  but at a lower gross margin percentage  also accounted for the decline in gross margin percentage between the comparable periods 
the overall decline has been partially offset by the company s inswitch product  which carries a higher software component than traditional turnkey system sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in gross margin between fiscal and is attributable to a variety of factors  particularly product platform changes that required the company to increase allowances for excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in addition  the company wrote off the value of unreturned out of warranty items and certain demo units 
also  in the fourth quarter replay and replay plus units were discounted in preparation for the repartee transition 
the margin decrease related to the transition was offset by margin gains in the strategic partner channel with the third quarter release of the inswitch product  as well as a overall increase of telanophy sales 
other factors mitigating the margin decrease included the settlement of third party vendor hardware problems as well as recognition of patent license fees related to the company s stutter detect patent 
research and development change change dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the acceleration of the development effort associated with the company s windows nt based product  unity  resulted in the majority of the fiscal year increase in research and development expenses over the prior fiscal year 
the substantial development resources required to build a native nt unified messaging product from the ground up necessitated the dollar growth in research and development expenses 
the company does not capitalize software development costs 
as the development expenditures associated with unity  which was released at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  were in advance of actual product revenues  the research and development expenses as a percentage of sales also increased 
contract development staff and employee compensation related expenses were the largest components of the increase 
a one time bonus in the fourth quarter of fiscal was awarded to the unity development staff for meeting the product s targeted release date  and accounted for approximately of the incremental expenses 
the customization of products for the company s strategic partners and the ongoing globalization of products for international markets also contributed to the increase 
in addition  the competitive nature of the labor market and the company s effort to attract and retain skilled employees has led to an overall increase in engineering salaries 
the company believes that in order to remain competitive in a rapidly changing technological environment  it will continue to be necessary to allocate significant resources to the development of new products  globalization of products for international markets and customization of products for strategic partners 
the company expects the dollar amount of research and development expenditures to continue to increase for the foreseeable future  and that these expenses as a percentage of sales will vary from period to period 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in research and development expenses  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of net sales between the fiscal years ending and were primarily attributable to an increase in compensation related costs associated with additional engineering and development personnel and project based contract development staff and associated recruiting costs 
the increase in engineering personnel is attributable to the company s development of new windows nt based products as well as to the addition of pronexus inc development staff 
in addition  engineering salaries have increased due to the competitive nature of the labor market and the company s effort to attract and retain skilled employees 
significant releases during fiscal included the lingo and inswitch products  described above 
the introduction of repartee in the fourth quarter to the north american dealer network offers telanophy capability with every repartee system sold within the channel 
the company also developed and announced version of viewcall registered trademark plus  which takes advantage of a powerful new scripting tool  phonebasic tm 
with phonebasic  viewcall plus can be integrated to work with a variety of general business applications 
sales and marketing change change dollars in thousands sales and marketing    percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended march  over the prior fiscal year were primarily attributable to increased compensation related expenses associated with growth in sales and marketing personnel and higher commissions due to increased sales levels 
leveraging these additional expenses over a growing revenue base resulted in a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in unit volume has also caused expenses to be higher when compared to the prior year  as more resources have been devoted to supporting a larger number of systems 
furthermore  in preparation for the release of unity  training expenses and additional technical staff were necessary to strengthen the company s product support infrastructure 
sales and marketing expenses include both costs that are essentially fixed as well as costs that vary from period to period relative to sales volume and thus can be expected to fluctuate both in dollar amount and as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
fiscal compared to fiscal most of the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended march  when compared to the prior year is due to overall increased compensation related expenses and the addition of new personnel  particularly technical and strategic partner support staff 
the increase in technical support personnel is attributable to the demand for network and desktop support resources as a result of the product shift to repartee and cti offerings 
a increase in unit volume has also caused expenses to be higher when compared to the prior year  as more resources have been devoted to supporting a larger number of systems 
trade show expenditures and other promotional efforts also increased in an effort to establish awareness of the new lingo and repartee products  as well as pronexus visual basic application tools 
general and administrative change change dollars in thousands general and administrative    percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  is attributable to higher compensation related expenses 
specifically  the company added information system staff and devoted more resources to internal workstation and network support 
depreciation associated with the company s continued investment in its management information system infrastructure as well as higher software costs also contributed to the increase 
the company s international general and administrative expenses also increased when compared to the prior year  due to the acquisition of its european distributor in mid fiscal  and to the conversion of its australian and uk offices from branch to subsidiary operations 
general and administrative expenses can be expected to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
fiscal compared to fiscal approximately two thirds of the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended march  can be attributed to increased headcount and additional compensation related expenses  and one fourth the result of increased consulting services 
these additional expenses are primarily associated with the company s continued investment in its management information systems infrastructure 
specifically  in fiscal the company upgraded and standardized many of its in house computer systems and network equipment  as well as implemented a new customer management software program 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable due to improved collection statistics 
non recurring charge for purchased  in process research and development during january  the company recognized a non recurring charge of million for purchased  in process research and development as a result of the acquisition of a majority interest in pronexus  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense and interest income change change dollars in thousands interest expense interest income fiscal compared to fiscal the company incurred interest expense in fiscal year ended march  as it borrowed against its line of credit to fund operations 
the decrease in interest income in the current year compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower average invested cash and marketable security balances as the company allowed its investments to mature without reinvesting the proceeds 
average cash and marketable security balances decreased due primarily to the company s net loss 
see liquidity and capital resources 
fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income during fiscal was primarily attributable to lower average invested cash and marketable security balances 
average cash and marketable security balances decreased due to increased inventory holdings  vendor prepayments and certain business combinations 
income tax benefit provision change change dollars in thousands income tax   effective tax rate variations in the customary relationship between the income tax provision and the statutory income tax rate of result from certain nondeductible expenses  tax exempt investment income  research and development tax credits  and the benefit provided by the company s foreign sales corporation 
the company expects the effective tax rate to fluctuate in the future due to the impact of changing research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest income  and foreign sales corporation benefits as a percentage of taxable income 
in addition  the company anticipates that its operations may fall under the jurisdiction of additional taxing authorities as its operations continue to expand into new geographical areas 
fiscal compared to fiscal under financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a deferred tax asset is recognized for deductible future temporary differences 
a valuation allowance against this asset is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
fas requires an assessment of all available evidence both positive and negative 
management believes the company will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance because a significant portion of the operating loss was generated by the deliberate investment in the development of the unity product ahead of planned revenues  prior to which the company had a long and stable history of earnings 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will generate taxable income or that all of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to benefit rate as a result of pretax losses in the fiscal year ended march  during the year the company exhausted all net operating loss nol carrybacks 
any additional nol s will be carried forward  resulting in income tax benefits in future periods with taxable income 
as a result of the company s pretax losses for the year ended march   the company will receive a refund of income taxes previously paid 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s effective tax rate increased to benefit rate as a result of a pretax loss in fiscal from in fiscal the significant increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the company s small pretax loss in fiscal as the company s operating results approach the break even level as in fiscal  the tax benefits provided by tax exempt income  the fsc and the research and development tax credit increase as a percentage of the pretax operating result even though the absolute dollar value of these benefits has not significantly changed 
net income loss and earnings loss per share change change dollars in thousands  except per share data net income loss    percentage of net sales earnings loss per share basic  diluted  fiscal compared to fiscal net income loss and earnings loss per share for the year ended march  in comparison to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year were primarily attributable to the increased operating expenses  as discussed above under the individual income statement captions 
the company believes these investments are essential to prepare for new product direction and future growth 
these investments in the development  marketing and support of new products are expected to continue into the next year 
furthermore  the declines in gross margin as a percentage of net sales have also contributed to the decreases in net income and earnings per share 
the average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the two periods was comparable 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income and earnings per share in fiscal decreased compared to due primarily to increased operating expenses  as discussed under the individual income statement captions 
the company believes these investments are essential to prepare for new product direction and future growth 
this investment in the development of new offerings and distribution channels  and the individuals that support them  is expected to continue throughout the next fiscal year 
furthermore  the decline in gross margin percentage  combined with relatively modest increases in sales volume to leverage over the added operating expenses  has contributed to the decrease 
the average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the two periods was comparable 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities decreased to million  or of total assets  at march  from million  or of total assets  at march  the decrease is due primarily to the net loss 
cash flow used in operations totaled million during the twelve months ended march  the company had net working capital of million at march  accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased to million at march  from million at march  the increase in accounts receivable balances was due to higher net sales in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year compared to net sales in the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year 
days sales outstanding at march  declined approximately from march  inventory decreased to million at march  from million at march   reflecting the company s continued efforts to efficiently manage component stocking levels

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that ongoing maturity of securities in its investment portfolio  together with cash flow from operations and the availability of alternative financing arrangements will provide sufficient resources to finance operations for at least the next year 
year yk an issue affecting the company and others is the inability of many computer systems and applications to correctly process date data in and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company formed task forces to investigate the year readiness of its products and of its internal systems 
the company has completed its assessment of the year readiness of its internal business process systems and applications 
the company has received assurances from the suppliers that the company s most critical business process systems and applications are currently or will be year ready by december  the company believes that other internal systems are also year ready 
the company intends to continue monitoring its systems through the year the company estimates that the total cost of replacement or upgrade of internal systems replaced solely to achieve year readiness will be less than  the majority of which has already been incurred 
the company has also implemented programs to assist customers with older versions of its products in obtaining year readiness by making software upgrades or replacement hardware available and offering programs for migrations to current product versions 
the company estimates that the costs of creating software patches and administering its upgrade programs for customers will be approximately  the majority of which has already been incurred 
the financial impact to the company of the development and administration of the upgrade programs has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
however  if any customers do not make necessary modifications  conversions  migrations  or upgrades  it could have a material adverse effect on the company in the form of legal costs or the loss of customers 
the company has been served with three class action lawsuits  one in alabama state court  one in indiana state court  and one in massachusetts state court  related to the alleged inability of the company s products prior to repartee to function properly with respect to the year the plaintiffs in the suits seek to require the company to remedy the alleged defect in these products and also seek damages 
the company has filed its answer in the suits in alabama and massachusetts 
the company believes that the claims stated in the cases are without merit  that the cases are not appropriate for class action  and the company intends to defend itself vigorously 
however  due to the preliminary status of the proceedings  it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cases or their financial impact on the company 
the company has contacted its third party suppliers to assess and seek reasonable assurances concerning the year readiness of their products and has contacted its primary suppliers concerning the year readiness of their internal systems as well 
the company has received assurances from many of its suppliers that their products and services are year ready  but has concerns that some suppliers may be unable to control their supply chain and may experience year interruptions 
because the company has no control over third parties products  services or internal operations  the company cannot ensure year readiness by its suppliers 
the company is developing contingency plans for third party suppliers it believes may be at risk  including qualifying alternative suppliers or increasing inventory levels prior to january because some products and services are highly proprietary  the company cannot ensure that acceptable substitutes will be available 
the company has also requested and will assess any available information from major customers concerning their internal year readiness 
because the company has no control over third parties products  services or internal operations  the company cannot ensure year readiness by its customers 
the company has not determined the most likely worst case scenario for the company with respect to the year problem as it is still assessing the year readiness of its important business partners 
risk factors affecting future operating results certain statements contained herein are dependent upon numerous factors  circumstances and contingencies 
the following factors  while not all inclusive  could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated competitive pressure from new entrants to the cti market  including large software companies and telephone switch manufacturers with greater resources  could adversely affect the company s business 
introduction of new products by the company or its competitors and the extent of their success or failure could produce significant fluctuations in market demand for the company s products 
increasing price competition in the company s marketplace could influence the amount and timing of changes in the company s prices to its customers  and therefore negatively impact the company s gross margins 
gross margins may also either increase or decrease as a result of further shifts in product mix depending upon the percentage of net sales contributed by software only sales in comparison to turnkey system sales 
there can be no assurance that new products will not be delayed  resulting in lost customers or allowing competitors to gain market share  or that such products will be successful in the marketplace 
the extent and timing of new product development and the need or desire to modify existing products may cause notable increases in research and development spending 
increasing international sales may require notable increases in development spending associated with localization of products for foreign markets 
additional operating losses in excess of management expectations may cause the company s existing cash and marketable security balances to be insufficient to fund its operations 
as a result  the company may be required to seek alternate sources of financing or may be required to abate current expense levels 
there can be no assurance that alternate financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
risks that the company  its suppliers  or its customers do not address any year readiness issues in a timely or effective manner 
see year update above 
if the company experiences delays in shipments whether it is due to delays from customers or as a result of the timing of new product introductions by the company in a given quarter  or if new order bookings do not meet anticipated levels  substantial fluctuations in operating results will occur 
frequently  these developments may not become apparent to the company until near or at the end of the quarter 
in addition  changes in the product and channel mix  and the timing of customer orders  will continue to affect the variability of quarterly results of operations in future quarters 
dependence on continued sales to significant customers could have a significant impact on the company s operations as there is no assurance that any particular customer will continue to purchase similar volumes of the company s products 
risks associated with the company s movement into the larger end user market  such as product acceptance and demand and failure to attract sufficient market share  could affect the company s future performance 
growth strategies involving acquisitions  strategic relationships  and vendor relationships may encounter legal and or unforeseeable business risks beyond the company s control 
risks associated with foreign operations such as gains and losses on the conversion of foreign currencies to us dollars  export import regulations  customs matters  foreign collection problems  and military  political and transportation risks may significantly affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s international sales involve additional risks associated with governmental regulation  product adaptation to local languages and switching systems  and uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not use or hold any derivative financial instruments 
the company is exposed to both foreign currency and interest rate risk  either of which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company has assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to international sales  distribution and support subsidiaries
