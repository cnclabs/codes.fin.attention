the company does not expect to generate additional positive cash flow from operations until the second half of due to the substantial costs for commercialization of its adcon family of products  additional research and development costs for adcon a  adcon i and adcon c and for costs related to its cognition modulation and ad programs  preclinical testing  clinical trials and operating expenses associated with supporting such activities

year the year issue results from computer programs and systems that were created to accept only two digit dates 
such systems may not be able to distinguish from this could result in miscalculations and system failures that could inhibit the company s ability to engage in normal business activities 
the following discussion of the implications of the year issue for the company contains numerous forward looking statements 
the cost of the company s year project and the date upon which the company plans to complete its internal modifications are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing a number of assumptions of future events  including  without limitation  the continued availability of internal and external resources  third party modifications and other factors 
although management believes it will be able to make the necessary modifications in advance  there can be no guarantee that these estimates and timetable will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition  the company relies upon the computer systems of certain third parties such as customers  suppliers and financial institutions 
although the company is assessing the readiness of these third parties and preparing contingency plans  there can be no guarantee that the failure of these third parties to modify their systems in advance of december  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
state of readiness 
in  the company commenced a program intended to mitigate and prevent the adverse effect of the year issue 
this program consists of the following phases awareness phase development of a detailed strategic approach to address the year issues  assessment phase an assessment of all computer systems  software  building infrastructure components and equipment with embedded technology to indentify each item that will require date code remediation and an assessment and certification of third parties year compliance  remediation phase implementation of code enhancements  hardware and software upgrades  systems replacements  vendor and customer assurances  contingency planning and other associated changes  and validation phase testing of systems for year readiness 
the awareness and assessment phases have been completed 
the company expects the remediation phase to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of the company s remediation phase consists of numerous individual projects that vary in size  materiality and importance 
the company has established a year project team that is currently reviewing information technology it systems and non it systems that could be affected by this issue 
the company believes that its network information systems  including network operating system nos software and enterprise resource planning erp software have been thoroughly tested as year compliant  and should be able to process year and data information beyond the year while the manufacture of the company s products are not dependent on computer chip driven processes  any interruption in receipt of supplies  delivery of goods by outside carriers  or processing of orders by distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition or result of operations 
the company communicated its year status to all of its existing customers and vendors by december  in this communication  the company requested that these same customers and vendors respond with their year status 
the company maintains a database of customers and vendors who have and have not responded to such inquiry  and the company will promptly submit further inquiries to certain of such third parties as business requirements dictate 
although the company estimates that  as of december   it had received responses from over of its customers and vendors  it had received responses from all material suppliers  customers and vendors 
the company has also requested similar information regarding year status from hospitals where its products are being used and the company monitors responses  if any  received from these hospitals 
there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent any material adverse effect on the operations and business of the company if such suppliers and business partners fail to convert their systems before december  costs 
the company expects to primarily utilize internal resources to reprogram  replace and test its computer systems  software  equipment and building infrastructure components for year modifications 
the company now estimates that year expenditures will be less than  and will be funded by normal operating cash flow 
all year expenditures are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material effect on results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
as of december  approximately  of the estimated project cost have been incurred 
the remaining costs are expected to be incurred evenly over the period up through january  these cost estimates may change as additional remediation and testing efforts progress 
risks 
the year issue presents a number of risks and uncertainties that could affect the company  including failure of utilities  competition for skilled personnel and disruption of company operations due to system failures or operational failures of third parties 
with respect to risks associated with the company s computer systems and equipment  management believes that it will be able to make the necessary modifications and conversions in advance of the year with respect to risks associated with the failure of computer systems or equipment of third parties  the company could experience a material adverse impact on its operations if such third parties fail to make timely conversions or modifications 
the most serious impact on the company operations in this regard would result if the third party manufacturer is unable to supply the company with product and if basic services such as telecommunications  electric power  financial services and other non it processes were disrupted 
contingency plans 
the company is in the process of developing business resumption contingency plans specific to the year these plans will address the actions that would be taken if critical business functions cannot be carried out in the normal manner upon entering the next century due to systems or third party failures 
management estimates that these contingency plans will be developed by the end of the second quarter of euro conversion 
on january   eleven of the fifteen countries the participating countries that are members of the european union established a new uniform currency known as the euro 
the currency existing prior to such date in the participating countries will be phased out during the transition period commencing january  and ending january  during such transition period both the euro and the existing currency will be available in the participating countries 
although certain of the company s products are being sold in the participating countries through independent distributors  the company receives revenues from such sales in us dollars 
as a result  the company does not anticipate that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect the company s business  prospects  results of operations or financial condition
