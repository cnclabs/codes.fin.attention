see year readiness 
in may  the company acquired a percent ownership interest in itc for million  and incurred approximately  of expenses associated with the investment 
itc was a development stage company in may and was focusing its efforts on developing certain early stage technologies 
due to the uncertainty regarding the realization of its investment  the company charged the purchase price and related acquisition costs to operations during the year ended december  as in process research and development 
in connection with the company s investment in itc  the company extended to itc a credit line of up to million of senior debt under a loan agreement the loan agreement that bears interest at per annum

as of february   itc had borrowed  under this facility 
the company has not recorded interest income on the note receivable from itc because interest is not due until the earlier of i the closing of any debt or equity financing by itc resulting in at least  in gross procees to itc  ii the merger or consolidation  or other combination  of itc into or with another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of itc or iii thirty months following november  or following the date upon which the company exercises its option to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of itc 
in addition  under the loan agreement  the payment of all interest will be waived if the company exercises its option to convert its senior debt into additional equity 
this option to convert expires may  but may be extended until no later than november  under certain conditions 
the company believes that if it does not exercise this option the amount due from itc will be collectible from itc s future cash flows or from independent financing 
during the year ended december   the company recorded  as its equity in the loss of itc  and reduced the carrying value of the note receivable by such amount 
the company believes that the carrying value of the note  approximately million as of december   is fully realizable 
during  itc generated  of product revenues and expects product revenues to increase significantly during on march   itc entered into an agreement for the issuance and sale of  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share to a third party 
the agreement provides for the issuance of additional shares of common stock to the purchaser if itc does not reach certain milestones as set forth in the agreement 
in connection with this issuance  itc issued  shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock to nmt in order for nmt to maintain its percent ownership interest in itc 
a portion of the proceeds from this financing was used to repay certain bridge financing  including  provided by the company in december the company is party to various other substantial contractual arrangements including salaries and fees for current employees and consultants which are likely to increase as additional agreements are entered into and additional personnel are retained 
the company also has committed to purchase certain minimum quantities of the vena cava filter from a supplier through june see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  all of these arrangements require cash payments by the company over varying periods of time 
certain of these arrangements are cancelable on short notice and certain require termination or severance payments as part of any early termination 
the company may require additional funds for its research and product development programs  preclinical and clinical testing  operating expenses  regulatory processes  manufacturing and marketing programs and potential licenses and acquisitions 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the sales of its products  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in the company s existing research  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any collaborative  licensing and other similar arrangements that the company may establish 
year readiness prior to the company s acquisition of eni  the company had reviewed its internal computer systems and their capabilities of recognizing the year and years thereafter 
at that time  the company believed that it was year compliant in all material respects 
in addition  prior to the acquisition of eni by the company  management of eni had determined that its financial and operational systems needed modification or replacement not only to be year compliant but to a improve functionality  b assure continued euro currency compliance  c provide more meaningful information and d integrate the various companies within eni onto a world class enterprise reporting system erp 
eni management had developed a comprehensive plan for implementing the new system  including selecting the system and related providers of implementation assistance  but the decision to proceed was postponed until the closing of the acquisition 
after the closing of the acquisition  the company authorized the plan described above in august  and committed to the implementation of a new erp system for its nmt neurosciences division 
the new systems are expected to be operational by the end of the third quarter of at a total project cost of million  of which approximately million will be for computer hardware and other capital expenditures 
the company anticipates financing the capital component above and expects to fund the remainder from operating cash flows 
while the company currently does not have a contingency plan in the event a particular system is not year compliant  such a plan will be developed if it becomes clear that the company is not going to achieve its scheduled compliance objectives 
since the company is completely replacing the systems at its neurosciences division with a commercially available and tested erp product  it is believed that the project will proceed more efficiently than had the company chosen to modify its existing systems 
currently  the project is slightly behind schedule due to a delayed start 
however  target dates have remained unchanged as the company believes they continue to be realistic 
since the company interfaces with its major customers and suppliers via telephone and fax  the company does not expect to incur significant losses in the event that either the company or its customers and suppliers are not year compliant 
the company has obtained notices from major customers and suppliers that they are year compliant 
in addition  the company s products are year compliant 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the implementation of its erp system are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member states of the european union adopted the euro as their national currency unit and irrevocably established fixed conversion rates between their existing or legacy currency units and the euro 
during the three year transition period between january  and january   the euro will be a cashless currency  existing only as a unit of account 
payments made to accounts in these member states may be made either in the denominated legacy currency unit of the account or in euros 
beginning on january   euro banknotes and coins will be introduced  and legacy currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn from circulation 
no later than july   the euro will be the sole national currency unit in these member states  and the legacy currency banknotes and coins will no longer be accepted as legal tender 
the company  including its neurosciences division  conducts a substantial portion of its business within the member countries of the european union  and accordingly  its existing systems are generally capable of accommodating multiple currencies  including the euro 
the new erp system described above will also assure continued euro currency compliance 
the company has formed a task force and has begun to assess the potential impact to the company that may result from the euro conversion 
in addition to tax and accounting considerations  the company is assessing the potential impact from the euro conversion in a number of areas  including the following the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  the impact on currency exchange costs and currency exchange rate risk  and the impact on existing contracts 
at this early stage of its assessment  the company cannot yet predict the anticipated impact of the euro conversion on the company 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have failed to meet covenants in our subordinated loan agreement and have obtained a waiver 
we financed our acquisition of the neurosurgical instruments business of elekta with million of cash plus approximately million of acquisition costs and a million subordinated note we issued to an affiliate of one of our stockholders 
the subordinated note is secured by all of our assets  is due on september  and requires us to pay interest on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of 
the note includes certain restrictive covenants relating to the maintenance of certain ratios and cash levels 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants at december  as of march   we were not in compliance with one of the covenants contained in the subordinated note relating to our cash position 
we negotiated a waiver of the default with the noteholder and  in connection with such waiver  the covenants were amended to be more restrictive including monthly financial covenants in some cases 
also  we issued to the noteholder warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
although we believe that we will be able to satisfy the covenants as modified  our failure to meet our financial plan in any given month could result in our breach of certain of the covenants 
if we breach any of the covenants under the subordinated loan agreement and are not successful in obtaining a waiver  the noteholder could demand repayment of the note 
in addition  in the event of a breach of certain of the covenants  including the financial covenants  the interest rate under the note will increase to per annum until we cure the default or the noteholder waives the default 
currently  we are seeking to refinance this debt 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance this debt at all or on acceptable terms 
we face uncertainties with respect to commercialization  product development and market acceptance of our products 
we currently market eight product lines 
before certain of our products can be marketed and sold in the united states  we may be required to conduct further research  product development  preclinical and clinical testing and obtain additional governmental regulatory approvals 
we cannot be certain that our current products  or any other products that we develop  will achieve or continue to have market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
currently  the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments  and these other treatments have a long history of use 
we cannot be certain that our devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community  in general  will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional products 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
we may be unable to compete successfully due to intense competition and rapid technological change in the industry 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will continue to compete directly with our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that utilize our products 
as a result  any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
our business could be materially adversely effected if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses 
in july  we completed the purchase of the neurosurgical instruments business of elekta ab publ 
acquisitions such as the elekta purchase involve a number of special risks  including 
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
difficulties in the assimilation of the personnel  information systems and operations of the acquired business  
risks in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and 
the loss of key employees of the acquired company 
the anticipated benefits of an acquisition  including the elekta purchase  may not be achieved unless we effectively address those special risks 
while we believe that we will successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired to date  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in integrating the operations and products of acquisitions or that the benefits from any integration will be realized 
we face challenges in managing our recent growth 
the company s business has grown rapidly in the last year 
our staff grew from full time employees and one part time employee at december  to full time employees and part time employees at december  in addition  our recent expansion has resulted in substantial growth in the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic area of our operations and customers  resulting in increased responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the expansion and growth of our business has placed significant demands on management and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage our growth effectively  including by 
developing and improving our operational  financial and other internal systems  
improving our sales and marketing capabilities  and 
continuing to train  motivate and manage our employees 
management has limited experience managing a business of our size 
any inability to manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain key personnel and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face additional capital requirements in the future  and insufficient funds may prevent us from implementing our business strategy 
we may require additional funds for our research and product development programs  preclinical and clinical testing  operating expenses  regulatory processes and manufacturing and marketing programs 
our cash needs will depend on a number of factors  including product sales  the progress of research and development programs and preclinical and clinical testing  the cost and time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in our key existing business relationships and the terms of any new relationships that we establish 
although we believe that existing resources and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the balance of the current fiscal year  if our cash and current resources are not sufficient  we will need to obtain additional sources of funding 
we can not assure you that additional sources of funding will be available at all or on acceptable terms 
insufficient funds may prevent us from implementing our business strategy or may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and product development programs or to license to third parties rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
our future success may depend in part upon maintenance of business relationships with collaborators 
we have entered into distribution agreements with bard radiology and bard international granting them exclusive distribution rights to our snf  and into a license agreement with boston scientific granting boston scientific exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  market and distribute our stent technology  along with products incorporating such technology 
although bard radiology and bard international have agreed not to sell competing filters  boston scientific is not prohibited from selling other stents and  in fact  manufactures and licenses from others a variety of stents that may compete with our stents 
boston scientific may choose to emphasize such other stents in its developmental and marketing efforts 
we cannot be certain that these arrangements will be renewed or that our existing relationships with bard radiology  bard international or boston scientific will continue in their current form 
our business could be materially adversely affected if these arrangements prove unsuccessful or if these companies terminate their arrangements with us  negotiate lower prices  sell additional competing products  whether manufactured by themselves or others  or otherwise alter the nature of their relationships with us 
our limited manufacturing history  dependence on third party manufacturers and the possibility of non compliance with manufacturing regulations raise uncertainties with respect to our ability to commercialize future products 
we use third parties to manufacture and distribute certain of our products 
if our third party manufacturers experience delays or difficulties in producing  packaging or distributing our products  market introduction and subsequent sales of such products would be adversely affected  and we might have to seek alternative sources of supply 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to commercialize medical products as planned 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards including  but not limited to  good manufacturing practices and iso these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production or purchasing costs and may even prevent us from making or obtaining our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we  or a third party manufacturer  change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before that process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 
we may be unable to successfully market our products due to limited marketing and sales experience 
the company s neurosurgical implants and instruments and septal repair devices are generally marketed directly through the company s direct sales force 
because we have marketed our older products through third parties  we have limited experience marketing our products 
in order to market directly the cardioseal septal occluder  our neurosurgical instruments and any other related products  we will have to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may face intellectual property infringement claims 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be certain that 
any pending patent applications or any future patent application will result in issued patents  
the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us  
any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or 
others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued or that may be issued in the future to us or to our licensors 
whether or not patents are issued to us or to our licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as a result of government regulations  we may experience lower sales and earnings 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis or at all 
the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  regulatory approvals or clearances  
the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  
limitations on the intended use of a device imposed as a condition of regulatory approvals or clearances  or 
our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in addition  sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainties with respect to the availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as private insurance reimbursement programs  greatly affect revenues for suppliers of health care products and services 
such third party payors may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount  if any  of reimbursement which they provide to the physicians and clinics using our devices  or any other products that we may develop 
if  for any reason  the third party payors decided not to provide reimbursement for our products  this would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
moreover  mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause the government or private insurers to implement more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers and by governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
we may not have successfully redesigned the clamshell septal repair device 
between and  bard sponsored trials of an earlier version of the septal repair device  known as the clamshell 
in  bard discovered fractures of the stainless steel framework in certain of the devices implanted during such clinical trials and  following such discovery  suspended its clinical trials worldwide except for patients whose status of being at high risk for surgery made their use of the clamshell particularly necessary 
we determined that the fractures were caused by metal fatigue  resulting from higher than anticipated forces acting on the clamshell 
our redesign efforts resulted in the design of the current version of the septal repair device 
although the cardioseal septal occluder has undergone in vitro testing  we cannot be certain that such testing accurately simulates the actual forces in the human body or that similar fractures will not occur with the cardioseal septal occluder 
if such fractures occur with adverse clinical consequences  our efforts to commercialize the cardioseal septal occluder may be significantly delayed  as we may be required to invest significant resources in further design and engineering of the device  or we may even have to discontinue development efforts 
product liability claims  product recalls and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials carry an inherent risk that users will assert product liability claims against us or our third party distributors 
in these lawsuits  users might allege that their use of our devices had adverse effects on their health 
a product liability claim or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our devices are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
although we currently maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that in the future we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will avoid significant product liability claims and the attendant adverse publicity 
any product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
intense industry competition for qualified employees threatens our ability to attract and retain necessary  qualified personnel 
in the medical device field  there is intense competition for qualified personnel  and we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
both the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise such as marketing 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk is immaterial to the company 
as an international concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the united kingdom and france  as a result of its manufacturing activities and assets in those countries 
the accounts of the company s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
in translating the accounts of the foreign subsidiaries into us dollars  assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at year end  while stockholders equity is translated at historical rates 
revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate in effect during the year 
the company s foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations since the functional currency is the us dollar 
the adoption of the euro by certain members of the european union occurred on january  in light of the recent adoption of the euro  the company cannot yet predict what impact  if any  the euro will have on its foreign exchange exposure
