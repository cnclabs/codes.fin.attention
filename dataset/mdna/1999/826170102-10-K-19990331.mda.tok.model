license revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
license revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in the fiscal period as compared to in the fiscal period and in the fiscal period 
license revenues increased in absolute dollar amount during these periods from the respective prior year periods due to an increase in the number of licenses of siebel applications sold to new and existing customers and also due to licenses of new modules  released with the latest version of siebel applications  to existing users of siebel base applications 
this increase in the number of licenses was primarily due to continued demand by new and existing customers for products in the siebel applications family both in the united states and internationally 
during  approximately  of license revenue was attributable to products developed from technology acquired from nomadic systems  inc nomadic and interactive workplace  inc 
interactive 
the company expects that license revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but will remain the same or decrease as a percentage of total revenues as the company s maintenance revenues continue to grow as a result of increases in the installed base of customers on maintenance 
professional services  maintenance and other 
professional services  maintenance and other revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as a percentage of total revenues were in the fiscal period as compared to and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
these increases in absolute dollar amount were due to growth in the company s consulting business and growth in the installed base of customers with a maintenance component and maintenance renewals from products licensed in prior periods 
first year maintenance is typically sold with the related software license 
revenue related to such maintenance is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically twelve months 
the company expects that professional services  maintenance and other revenues will remain the same or increase as a percentage of total revenues due to increased maintenance revenues derived from the company s growing installed base and due to the company s expansion of its consulting organization to meet anticipated customer demands in connection with product implementation 
a relatively small number of customers account for a significant percentage of the company s license revenues 
for  and  sales to the company s ten largest customers accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
the company expects that licenses of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a large percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company markets its products in the united states through its direct sales force and internationally through its sales force and distributors primarily in japan  latin america  south africa and asia 
international revenues accounted for  and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the company is increasing its international sales force and is seeking to establish distribution relationships with appropriate strategic partners and expects international revenues will continue to account for a substantial portion of total revenues in the future 
cost of revenues software 
cost of software license revenues includes third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation and production 
cost of license revenues through december  has averaged less than of software license revenues 
all costs incurred in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred  and  as a result  cost of license revenues includes no amortization of capitalized software development costs 
these costs are expected to remain the same or increase as a percentage of total revenues 
professional services  maintenance and other 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues consist primarily of personnel  facilities and systems costs incurred in providing customer support 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as a percentage of professional services  maintenance and other revenues were for the year ended december  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in the absolute dollar amount reflect the effect of fixed costs resulting from the company s expansion of its maintenance and support organization and growth in the company s consulting business 
the company expects that professional services  maintenance and other costs will continue to increase in absolute dollar amount as the company expands both its customer support organization to support a growing installed base and its consulting organization to meet anticipated customer demands in connection with product implementation 
these costs are expected to remain the same or increase as a percentage of total revenues 
operating expenses product development 
product development expenses include expenses associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities  and consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  consulting costs and the cost of software development tools 
product development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in the fiscal period from and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
the increases in the dollar amount of product development expenses were primarily attributable to costs of additional personnel in the company s product development operations 
the company anticipates that it will continue to devote substantial resources to product development 
the company expects product development expenses to increase in absolute dollar amount but remain at a similar percentage of total revenues as in the company considers technological feasibility of its software products to have been reached upon completion of a working model that has met certain performance criteria 
the period between achievement of technological feasibility and general release of a software product is typically very short  and development costs incurred during that period have not been material 
accordingly  the company has not capitalized any software development costs to date 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  field office expenses  travel and entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as a percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses were in  from and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
the increases in the dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses reflect primarily the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  costs associated with expanded promotional activities  and indirect merger related costs  such as corporate sales training and marketing programs 
the company expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amount as the company continues to expand its sales and marketing efforts  establishes additional sales offices in the united states and internationally and increases promotional activities 
these expenses are expected to remain at a similar percentage of total revenues as in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and occupancy costs for administrative  executive and finance personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as a percentage of total revenues were in the fiscal period as compared to and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
the increases in the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses were primarily due to increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s increased scale of operations 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amount as a result of the continued expansion of the company s administrative staff and facilities to support growing operations 
the company anticipates that its general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues should remain at a similar percentage as in merger related expenses 
in connection with the merger with scopus  the company incurred direct merger related expenses of approximately  comprised primarily of investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other professional fees of  duplicate facilities and equipment of  and other miscellaneous expenses of  the company also incurred indirect merger related expenses of approximately  for joint sales training and merger related marketing costs  which are included within sales and marketing expenses 
the company incurred merger costs of approximately  in the third quarter of in connection with scopus planned merger with clear with computers  inc the merger plan was terminated early in the fourth quarter of on october   the company completed its purchase of interactive  a developer of intranet based business intelligence software technology that has been incorporated into the siebel interactive product 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
the company recorded a charge to income of  or per diluted share  pursuant to an allocation of the purchase price by an independent appraiser  as a write off of acquired research and development 
purchased in process research and development is related to the completion of interactive s data integration  filtering and formatting technology and its integration into the company s products 
at the time of acquisition  a prototype of interactive s product existed and was in limited trials  however  the prototype was not stable or sufficiently developed to be scalable on an enterprise wide basis 
interactive s technology was completed  at a cost of approximately  and incorporated as a separate module into the siebel product suite  which was released in june the company estimated that technology was approximately complete as of the acquisition date 
at that date  the only identifiable asset acquired was the technology under development 
accordingly  essentially all of the excess purchase price over net assets acquired  except for amounts assigned to net current assets  fixed assets and workforce in place  was assigned to in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired research and development was prepared using the income approach and contemplated that sales of products incorporating interactive s technology would be  in  increasing to  in  and declining significantly thereafter 
revenue increases were based upon the historical growth rate of software sales for the erm market and the company 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue ranged from in to in based upon the company s normal operating margin 
operating cash flows were reduced by an expected effective tax rate of consistent with the company s effective tax rate 
net cash flows were discounted to their present value at the acquisition date using an after tax risk adjusted discount rate of 
the company believes this discount rate is consistent with that required by venture capitalists for investments in unproven but partially developed software products 
through the end of  total revenues from siebel interactive were approximately  however  the company is unable to quantify the effect of siebel interactive as a competitive differentiator 
the company does not track selling  general and administrative costs by product but believes the incremental costs associated with selling and distributing siebel interactive were substantially lower than those used in the valuation due to synergies associated with selling the product as a separate module in the siebel product suite 
if the company is unable to continuously upgrade the siebel interactive product or existing and future customers do not elect to purchase this module  the company s ability to recover the value assigned to the acquired research and development will be impaired and revenue and profitability will be adversely affected 
on november   the company completed its purchase of nomadic  a provider of innovative business solutions to pharmaceutical sales forces 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
technology acquired from nomadic has been incorporated into the siebel pharma product 
the company recorded a charge to income of  or per diluted share  pursuant to an allocation of the purchase price by an independent appraiser  as a write off of acquired research and development 
the appraisal of the acquired research and development was based upon the present value of forecasted operating cash flows from the technology acquired  giving effect to the stage of completion at the acquisition date 
these forecasted cash flows were then discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved in completing the acquired technology 
the forecasted cash flows assumed inclusion of the product developed from acquired technology into the existing siebel product suite 
the purchased in process research and development expense related to completion of nomadic s second generation pharmaceutical sales force automation product 
this product was completed and enterprise wide deployment to end user customers commenced in march much of the functionality was incorporated into the company s pharma product  which was released in june at the time of the acquisition  nomadic had a first generation product at a limited number of customers  with a very small user base 
there were a considerable number of uncertainties as to increasing the product s scalability for deployment on an enterprise wide basis  improving the stability of the application and identifying and fixing bugs 
the company allocated limited excess purchase price over net assets acquired to net current assets  fixed assets and workforce in place 
the majority of the excess purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets goodwill based upon the expected cash flows from nomadic s existing product and the product under development  giving consideration to the stage of completion of the technology under development at the acquisition date 
this technology was completed  at a cost of approximately  for enterprise wide release in march the valuation of acquired research and development was prepared using the income approach and contemplated that sales of products incorporating nomadic s technology would be  in  increasing to  in  and declining significantly thereafter 
revenue increases were based upon the historical growth rate of software sales for the erm market and the company 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue were estimated at  based upon the company s normal operating margin 
operating cash flows were reduced by an expected effective tax rate of consistent with the company s effective tax rate 
net cash flows were discounted to their present value at the acquisition date using an after tax risk adjusted discount rate of 
the company believes this discount rate is consistent with that required by venture capitalists for investments in unproven but partially developed software products 
through the end of  total revenues from products incorporating the nomadic technology under development at the acquisition date were approximately  although the company does not track selling  general and administrative costs by product  because these products are sold as vertical erm solutions for the pharmaceutical industry  the company believes the operating margin is similar to the company s consolidated operating margin 
if the company is unable to continuously upgrade the pharma product or superior products are released by competitors  the company s ability to recover the value assigned to the acquired research and development will be impaired and revenue and profitability will be adversely affected 
operating income and operating margin operating income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  and operating margin was in the fiscal period  as compared with and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
excluding merger related expenses  operating income increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and operating margin was in the fiscal period as compared to and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
these increases in operating income and margin  excluding merger related expenses  were due to increases in license revenues without a proportional increase in cost  particularly costs associated with the hiring of new personnel 
other income  net other income  net  is primarily comprised of interest income earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and reflects earnings on increasing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes income taxes are comprised primarily of federal and state taxes 
the provision for income taxes was   and  in   and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was  and  respectively 
the tax rate in was higher than the rates in and primarily due to non deductible items related to acquisitions 
the company expects its effective tax rate in to be approximately  excluding the effect of non deductible costs such as merger related expenses 
net income loss the company had net income of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  and net income of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income per share was per diluted share in fiscal  compared with a net loss of and net income of in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
excluding merger related expenses  the company had pro forma net income of  for the year ended december  compared to net income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pro forma net income per diluted share was per share in fiscal  compared with pro forma net income of and in the fiscal and periods  respectively 
pro forma net income as a percentage of total revenues was in the year ended december  compared to and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to  as of december  from  as of december   representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to cash flows from operations and  to a lesser extent  sale of common stock through the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
the increase was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  purchases of property and equipment and short term investments 
the company has generated positive cash flow from operating activities in  and of the approximately  of purchases of property and equipment during  approximately  related to computer and networking equipment to support the company s introduction of siebelnet 
siebelnet is a family of application hosting  outsourcing and training services designed to help customers quickly deploy and easily manage their sales  marketing and customer service systems 
the company has used fully serviced office suites on a month to month rental basis to establish its presence in new locations 
as these locations expand  the company expects to transition more of the office suites to leased space 
this transition will involve build out of tenant improvements  acquisition of furniture and fixtures  and other capital costs  which were not incurred in connection with the use of fully serviced office suites 
the company has already built out leased facilities  both domestically and internationally  and expects this trend to continue 
capital expenditures of the nature described above are expected to increase during and the company believes that the anticipated cash flows from operations  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be adequate to meet its cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
recent developments on may   the company completed the acquisition of scopus of emeryville  california  a leading provider of customer service  field service  and call center software solutions 
under the terms of the agreement  each outstanding share of scopus common stock was exchanged for newly issued shares of common stock of the company 
this resulted in the issuance of approximately million additional shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  all outstanding stock options of scopus were converted into the right to acquire the company s common stock at the same exchange ratio with a corresponding adjustment to the exercise price 
in connection with the merger  the company incurred direct merger related expenses of approximately  consisting of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other professional fees of  integration charges related to duplicate facilities and equipment of  and other miscellaneous expenses of  the company also incurred indirect merger related expenses of approximately  for joint sales training and merger related marketing costs  which are included within sales and marketing expenses 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the financial statements of siebel have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations of scopus for all periods presented 
prior to the merger with siebel  scopus ended its fiscal year on march the restated financial statements as of december   and for prior periods  include siebel s results of operations for the calendar periods noted and scopus results of operations for the fiscal periods ending three months later 
beginning january   the reporting periods of siebel and scopus were conformed  and results of operations were combined for the calendar periods presented 
as a result of conforming the reporting periods of siebel and scopus  the operating results of scopus for the three month period ended march  are included in the restated financial statements for both and scopus revenues and net income for the three month period ended march  were  and  respectively 
net income for this period of approximately  is reflected as a reduction of opening retained earnings in the restated financial statements 
year preparedness many existing computer programs and systems use only two digit fields to identify the year  eg  and they are unable to process date and time information between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
accordingly  computer programs and software may need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
failure to complete the necessary modifications could cause a disruption or failure of such program and system 
the company s yk initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff and third party consultants specializing in yk issues 
the team s activities are designed to identify potential yk problems and to ensure that there is no adverse effect on our core business operations and that transactions with clients  suppliers and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company s efforts have focused on three areas i the company s products  ii internal operating systems and iii interfaces with third party systems 

products 
the company has put in place a certification program to verify the yk compliance of its products 
beginning with version siebel  the company s programs have been designed to be yk compliant 
the company has applied a number of test approaches and criteria to each of its products beginning with siebel and believes that all such products are yk compliant 
while we believe that most of our currently developed and actively marketed products are yk compliant for significantly all functionality  our software products could contain errors or defects relating to yk 
the company has advised certain of its customers that internal testing of yk compliance should be conducted to ensure that the operations managed by siebel products continue without disruption 
if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the yk issue could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
the costs incurred to test the company s products for yk compliance were incurred as normal product development expenses 
any additional expenses are expected to be minimal 

internal operating systems 
the company has implemented a plan to test all internal operating systems  such as computer hardware and software  telephone pbx systems  fax machines  facilities systems such as building access and other miscellaneous systems on a worldwide basis 
the company is approaching its yk internal readiness program in the following three phases i assessment  ii planning and iii implementation 
these phases include such individual steps as taking an inventory of the company s operating systems prioritized by risk  identifying failure dates  defining a solution strategy  estimating repair costs  identifying specific tasks necessary to ensure readiness  determining resource requirements and allocations  and finally  testing and fixing the operating systems as well as putting in place contingency plans for operating systems that have a high impact on the company s business 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the yk issue will not pose significant operational problems to our internal operating systems 
as of march  the implementation phase is underway 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the yk issue could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
costs incurred to date and expected costs to complete this process are not expected to be material 

third party systems 
the company has developed a yk process for dealing with its key suppliers  distributors  vendors and system integrators and other partners 
the company has been in contact with its key third party relationships regarding their yk compliance 
the company has received responses from its critical third party relationships  most of whom have stated that they expect to address all of their significant yk issues in a timely manner 
the company is working to identify and analyze the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios for third party relationships affected by yk 
these scenarios could include possible infrastructure collapse  the failure of water and power supplies  major transportation disruptions and failures of communications or financial systems any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to deliver its products and services to its customers 
while the company has contingency plans in place to address most issues under its control  an infrastructure problem outside of its control could result in a delay in product shipments  depending on the nature and severity of the problems 
as of february   the company has initiated the process of analyzing its third party systems and expects to complete the process by the fourth quarter 
however  if such analyses and required modifications  if any  are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the yk issue could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
costs incurred to date and expected costs to complete this process are not expected to be material 
although the company has spent a large amount of time and resource to address potential yk problems  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to identify and address all yk issues 
even if the company acts in a timely manner to complete all of its assessments and planned solutions  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
the discussion above regarding estimated completion dates  costs  risks and other forward looking statements regarding yk is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available and is subject to change 
as the company continues to progress with its yk initiatives  it may discover that actual results will differ materially from these estimates 
see risk factors year problems may cause an interruption in our business 
risk factors a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business 
we began operations in july we first shipped our siebel sales enterprise product in april and our siebel service enterprise product in december subsequent versions of these products were first shipped in and accordingly  we have a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
you should evaluate our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and uncertainties that companies in their early stage of development frequently encounter 
net revenue and operating results may fluctuate 
our net revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include 
level of product and price competition  
length of our sales cycle and customer purchasing patterns  
the size and timing of individual license transactions  
delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  
success in expanding our customer support organization  direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  
timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  
appropriate mix of products and services sold  
levels of international sales  
activities of and acquisitions by competitors  
timing of new hires and the allocation of our resources  
changes in the economy and foreign currency exchange rates  and 
our ability to develop and market new products and control costs 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based on the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our net revenue and operating results may vary drastically from quarter to quarter 
the main factors  which may affect these fluctuations  are 
the discretionary nature of our customer s purchase and budget cycles  
the size and complexity of our license transactions  
the potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  
the timing of new product releases  
seasonal variations in operating results  and 
variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
each customer s decision to implement our products and services is discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources and is subject to their budget cycles 
in addition  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  which has ranged to date from two to eighteen months 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
although we have not experienced significant seasonal variations in operating results  such variations could develop in the future 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily useful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
it is likely that our future quarterly operating results from time to time will not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which would likely have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
reliance on strategic relationship with systems integrators 
we have established strategic relationships with a number of organizations that we believe are important to our sales  marketing and support activities and the implementation of our products 
we believe that our relationships with these organizations provide marketing and sales opportunities for our direct sales force and expand the distribution of our products 
these relationships allow us to keep pace with the technological and marketing developments of major software vendors and provide us with technical assistance for our product development efforts 
in particular  we have established a non exclusive strategic relationship with andersen consulting  one of our principal stockholders 
we have also entered into significant relationships with other third party systems integrators such as pricewaterhousecoopers and deloitte consulting 
a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers for whom andersen consulting  or another systems integrator with which we have a significant relationship  have been engaged to provide system integration services 
any deterioration of our relationship with these significant third party systems integrators could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also have relationships with microsoft corporation  compaq computer corporation  itochu corporation and itochu techno science corporation  among others 
our failure to maintain existing relationships  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our current and potential customers may also rely on third party system integrators to develop  deploy and or manage siebel enterprise applications 
if we do not adequately train a sufficient number of system integrators  or if these integrators do not have or devote the resources necessary to implement our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the internet presents unique risks 
the siebel enterprise applications communicate through public and private networks over the internet 
the success of our products may depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products which are compatible with the internet 
we cannot predict with any assurance whether the internet will be a viable commercial marketplace or whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our products and the introduction of new products 
we may not be able to effectively compete in the internet related products and services market 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  demand  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation  remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of our products and distribution of our software 
if these critical issues are not favorably resolved  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
a competitive and rapidly changing market 
the market for client server application software is relatively new  highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we market our products only to customers who have migrated or are in the process of migrating their enterprise computing systems to client server computing environments 
our future financial performance will partly depend on the continued growth of organizations successfully adopting client server computing environments 
if the client server market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the market for customer information software is also highly competitive and rapidly changing 
our future financial performance will largely depend on growth in the number of customer information applications developed for use in client server environments 
if the customer information software market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
customers may not successfully implement our products 
many of our customers purchase and implement our products in phases 
our customers frequently deploy our products to large numbers of sales  marketing and customer service personnel 
these end users may not accept our products 
our products are also being deployed on a variety of computer hardware platforms and used with a number of third party software applications and programming tools 
this use may present significant technical challenges  particularly as large numbers of personnel attempt to use our product concurrently 
if existing customers have difficulty further deploying siebel enterprise applications or for any other reason are not satisfied with siebel enterprise applications  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
a limited number of products for our license revenues 
in  a substantial majority of our license revenues were attributable to sales of siebel sales enterprise  siebel service enterprise and related products 
we expect that such products and related consulting  maintenance and training services will continue to account for a substantial majority of our future revenues 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for such products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the length of time required to engage a client and to implement our products may be lengthy and unpredictable 
the timing of the sales and implementation of our products and services is lengthy and not predictable with any degree of accuracy 
you should not rely on prior sales and implementation cycles as any indication of future cycles 
the license of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by prospective customers and generally requires us to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
in addition  the implementation of our products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers and is commonly associated with substantial reengineering efforts that may be performed by the customer or third party system integrators 
the cost to the customer of our product is typically only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and integration costs of implementing a large scale sales and marketing information system 
for these and other reasons  the period between initial contact and the implementation of our products is often lengthy and is subject to a number of factors which may cause significant delays  many of which we have little or no control over 
these factors include i the size and complexity of our license transactions and ii delays in our customers implementation of client server computing environments 
a delay in the sale or implementation of even a limited number of license transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
expanding distribution may create additional risks 
we have expanded the distribution of our products in recent years 
this expansion has placed new and increased demands on our direct sales force and technical and sales support staff 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and training sufficient direct sales  technical and customer support personnel 
although we invest significant resources to expand our direct sales force and our technical and customer support staff  we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
we also may not be able to successfully expand our direct sales force or other distribution channels 
in addition  such expansion may not result in increased revenues 
any failure to expand our direct sales force or technical and customer support staff or to expand our distribution channels could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
revenue is concentrated in a relatively small number of customers 
our success depends on maintaining relationships with our existing customers 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
for  and  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of a small number of customers or any reduction or delay in orders by any such customer  or failure to successfully market our products to new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
success requires us to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by i rapid technological change  ii frequent introductions of new products  iii changing customer needs  and iv evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of the siebel enterprise applications that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements to the siebel enterprise applications are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
success requires us to effectively compete in the customer information systems market 
our products target the customer information systems market 
this market is highly competitive  rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product introductions 
we face competition primarily from our customers internal information technology departments and systems integrators  as well as from other application software providers that offer a variety of products and services to address this market 
many of our customers and potential customers have attempted to develop customer information systems  in house either alone or with the help of systems integrators 
we may not be able to compete successfully against such internal development efforts 
we rely on a number of systems consulting and systems integration firms for implementation and other customer support services  as well as for recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
although we seek to maintain close relationships with these service providers  many of them have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors 
if we are unable to develop and retain effective  long term relationships with these third parties  our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 
further  many of these third parties have significantly greater resources than we do and may market software products that compete with us 
the following table lists some of our current and potential competitors and their products 
company name product acxiom directmedia baan nv aurum software  inc nv frontoffice borealis corporation arsenal clarify  inc clearsales  clearsupport dendrite international  inc force one  dendrite series early cloud co

in addition  many competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
there are many factors that may increase competition in the customer information systems market  including i entry of new competitors  ii alliances among existing competitors and iii consolidation in the software industry 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we cannot compete successfully against current and future competitors or overcome competitive pressures  our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
if we do not maintain our relationship with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result 
portions of our products incorporate software that was developed and is maintained by third party software developers 
although we believe there are other sources for these products  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we depend in part on these third parties abilities to enhance their current products  to develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of that functionality could materially adversely affect our sales 
software errors or defects could reduce revenues 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
although we conduct extensive product testing during product development  we have been forced to delay the commercial release of products until the correction of software problems 
we could lose revenues as a result of software errors or defects 
our products are intended for use in sales applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  we expect that our customers and potential customers will have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
testing errors may also be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully manage our growth  our business may be negatively impacted 
our business has grown rapidly in recent years 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
to manage future growth we must continue to i improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and ii expand  train and manage our employee work force 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of our key personnel could negatively affect our performance 
our performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  particularly thomas m 
siebel  our chairman and chief executive officer 
none our key employees has entered into an employment agreement with us 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the protection of our proprietary information is limited 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
any patents issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate 
we have entered into agreements with substantially all of our customers that require us to place siebel enterprise applications source code into escrow 
such agreements generally provide that such parties will have a limited  non exclusive right to use such code if i there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  ii we cease to do business  or iii we fail to meet our support obligations 
although we do not believe that we are infringing any proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
furthermore  former employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such former employers 
any such claims  with or without merit  could i be time consuming to defend  ii result in costly litigation  iii divert management s attention and resources  iv cause product shipment delays  and v require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license or create a workaround for such infringed or similar technology may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we license certain software from third parties 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any of these software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions 
this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
year problems may cause an interruption in our business 
many existing computer programs and systems use only two digit fields to identify the year  eg  and the are unable to process date and time information between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
accordingly  computer programs and software may need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
although the company has spent a large amount of time and resource to address potential yk problems  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to identify and address all yk issues 
failure to complete the necessary modifications could cause a disruption or failure of such program and system 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year preparedness 
international operations involve unique risks 
our revenues are primarily derived from large multi national companies 
to service the needs of these companies  we must provide worldwide product support services 
we have expanded  and intend to continue expanding  our international operations and enter additional international markets 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for siebel enterprise applications 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including i foreign currency fluctuations  ii economic or political instability  iii shipping delays and iv various trade restrictions 
any of these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
significant increases in the level of customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in situations where direct sales are denominated in foreign currency  any fluctuation in foreign currency or the exchange rate may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain stockholders may be able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholders approval 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us together beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock as of december  in particular  thomas m 
siebel  our chairman and chief executive officer  owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise certain control over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of our assets 
this may prevent or discourage tender offers for our common stock 
stock price may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in june the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in earning estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the software and computer industries and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to ours and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our charter documents may prevent certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further approval by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of the common stock 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have instituted a classified board of directors in our certificate of incorporation 
this and certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our bylaws and of delaware law  could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest 
audit committee the company has established an audit committee of the board of directors  the charter of which is to oversee the activities of management and the company s external auditors as they relate to the financial reporting process 
in  the audit committee was comprised of james c 
gaither  charles r 
schwab and george t 
shaheen 
in particular  the audit committee s role includes ensuring that management properly develops and adheres to a sound system of internal controls  and that the company s auditors  through their own review  assess the effectiveness of those controls and management s adherence to them 
in fulfilling their responsibilities  the audit committee conducted regular  quarterly meetings with the company s outside auditors 
in each of these meetings  the audit committee met with the company s outside auditors  independent of management  to assure the audit committee an independent and confidential view of the company s management and internal controls as they relate to the quality and reliability of the company s financial statements 
the company is committed to supporting this process and the audit committee in fulfilling their role of ensuring the integrity of the company s internal controls and financial reporting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about the company s derivative financial instruments and financial instruments that are subject to market risk 
these include foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency receivables and intercompany balances  which are subject to exchange rate risk  and available for sale short term investments  which are subject to interest rate risk 
the company does not consider its cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
the company manages its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into contracts to sell foreign currency at the time a foreign currency receivable is generated 
when the foreign currency receivable is collected  the contract is liquidated  thereby converting the foreign currency to us dollars and mitigating the exchange rate risk 
the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio with debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
the company also manages interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that it is typically able to hold its investments to maturity 
the following summarizes the company s foreign currency forward contracts  all of which mature in  by currency  as of december  contract amounts are representative of the expected payments to be made under these instruments in thousands fair value contract contract at amount local amount december  currency us us german marks contracts to pay dm receive us dm   british pounds contracts to pay pounds receive us pounds  japanese yen contracts to pay yen receive us yen   the following summarizes the company s available for sale investments  as of december  expected maturity date thereafter us treasury securities   municipal securities
