safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained herein and in the following section and like statements elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of various factors 
set forth below are the principal factors and risks considered most likely to cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are results of insignia pops program 
it will be necessary to achieve lift results from the insignia pops program that are comparable to the results to date from the insignia pops program in order to obtain additional participating manufacturers and retailers at the rate anticipated by the company 
competition 
insignia pops will be competing for the marketing expenditures of branded product manufacturers  who use various forms of point of purchase marketing methods  such as displays  coupons  in store samples  etc 
there is no assurance that insignia pops will compete successfully with these traditional marketing methods 
sign production 
the company s ability to produce the planned number of signs will depend on a number of factors  including receipt of data and information from both the retailers and manufacturers and conducting the necessary training 
business conditions of the general economy 
cost of the raw material 
the company s printing gross margin percentage is a sensitive function of the cost of the raw paper materials 
sign card revenue 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from the sale of the bar coded sign cards required by the impulse and signright systems  which are no longer being marketed domestically by the company 
if a substantial number of existing customers discontinue the use of the sign card there could be a serious adverse effect on the company s revenue 
dependence on key employees 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of its present officers  and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the company 
none of the company s officers are bound by employment or non competition agreements with the company 
the success of the company will also depend on its ability to attract and retain capable sales and marketing personnel 
page year compliance general description the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or imbedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
year compliance the company has modified or upgraded portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  this modification and upgrade was completed in march the company believes that with these modifications and upgrades  the year issue has been mitigated 
third party the company does not have any direct interfacing with significant third party vendors 
the company has queried significant suppliers and subcontractors who do not share information systems with company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of insuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
cost the company utilized both internal and external resources to reprogram and modify the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project was approximately  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
product the company has made modifications to any of its products which require remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to the company s products
