item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company seeks to balance its mix of products and services and maintain overall stability in its operating results principally through increased levels of aftermarket sales  increased non us sales and end market diversification 
aftermarket sales accounted for of total company sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal sales to non us customers were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal of total company sales 
the company s primary markets are specialty chemicals  agri chemicals  pharmaceuticals  oil and gas exploration and production  wastewater treatment and food and beverage 
in fiscal  the company acquired a controlling interest in universal glasteel equipment in december  chemineer de mexico in june and gmm pfaudler limited in july these acquisitions are in the company s process systems business segment 
the total cost of the acquisitions was million in cash 
these acquisitions accounted for million of sales and million of ibit in fiscal in fiscal  the company purchased flow control equipment  inc fce and technoglass  srl technoglass in december fce is in the energy systems segment and technoglass is in the process systems segment 
the total cost of the acquisitions was million in cash  notes and assumed debt million after application of available fce cash at closing 
these acquisitions accounted for million of sales and million of ibit in fiscal in fiscal  the company purchased process supply  inc  spectrum products  inc 
and the high shear mixer business of greerco in february and industrie tycon spa tycon in may these acquisitions are in the process systems segment 
the total cost of the acquisitions was million in cash  company stock  notes and debt assumed 
these acquisitions accounted for million of sales and million of ibit in fiscal results of operations the following tables present components of the company s consolidated income statement and segment information 
consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses ibit before amortization and other amortization other ibit segment process systems sales    ibit before amortization and other    ibit    energy systems sales    ibit before amortization and other    ibit    total sales    ibit before amortization and other    ibit    fiscal compared to fiscal sales of million for fiscal were million lower than fiscal  an decrease 
pro forma sales  assuming all of the businesses owned at august   were owned for all of fiscal and fiscal decreased by million or 
the process systems segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal on a pro forma basis  the process systems segment sales decreased by million  an decrease 
this decrease was primarily driven by weak market demand in the specialty chemical market 
capital spending in this market has been reduced as operating rates and profitability levels have been weak 
order levels have declined faster than sales resulting in backlog decreasing to million from million at the beginning of the year 
the process systems segment is a long lead time business and this low level of opening backlog signals a slow first half of fiscal for this segment 
the energy systems segment was dramatically influenced by the decrease in crude oil prices in fiscal and  reaching a low of a barrel in early fiscal from price levels that were per barrel for several years 
oil exploration was significantly reduced and marginal wells were shut down 
as a result  our energy systems segment sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal on a pro forma basis sales decreased by million  a decrease 
late in fiscal crude oil prices recovered to the per barrel level and the company has seen a modest increase in order levels 
longer term stability in crude oil prices is needed before there is a full recovery in this market 
this segment is a short lead time business and backlog levels have increased slightly to million from million at the beginning of the year 
gross profit margins have declined to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the change in product mix 
the company s energy systems segment is a higher gross margin business and the significant decline in sales has caused total gross margin to decline 
secondarily  the lower volume in the process systems segment has also reduced gross margin levels slightly 
ibit before amortization and other for fiscal is million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
this decrease is primarily in the company s energy systems segment which declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  on a sales decline of million 
costs to support products in this segment are of a high fixed cost nature 
therefore  the cost structure cannot be adjusted quickly when sales decline rapidly 
the company is closing its fairfield  california manufacturing facility and has consolidated management 
however  these actions did not significantly benefit fiscal fiscal will see some of the cost benefit with the full impact coming in fiscal the benefits will not be fully realized until because the fairfield plant is expected to continue operating into the second quarter of fiscal in the process systems segment ibit before amortization and other decreased million on a sales decline of million and as a percent of sales decreased from to 
this level of volume decrease is more manageable and variable costs  primarily employment levels and variable pay plans  were adjusted to the lower volume levels minimizing the effect on ibit before amortization and other 
other has increased million 
this increase is primarily from the million charge in the second quarter of fiscal for closing and relocating the fairfield manufacturing plant and million of additional costs for relocation  transfer and training costs related to the fairfield plant which could not be accrued in the second quarter 
additionally  termination costs of million were recorded during the year  primarily related to employment reductions at moyno and chemineer 
lastly  equity income decreased by million because controlling interests were acquired in uge and gmm  the company s only equity investees  in december and july  respectively 
these businesses were consolidated and equity income was no longer recorded from those dates 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is from higher average debt levels in fiscal primarily because the million spent for fce was outstanding all of fiscal and only a portion of fiscal the company s effective interest rate was for both fiscal and fiscal the effective tax rate was for both fiscal and fiscal the fiscal rate is lower than the statutory rate because of a reduction in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in countries outside the us taxable income was generated in these countries justifying the reduction of these allowances 
additionally  the company generates a tax benefit from its foreign sales corporation 
net deferred income tax assets of million at august  primarily relate to us operations 
available carrybacks and future pretax income at recent levels would be sufficient to realize these assets 
net income and earnings per share for fiscal are million and compared to million and in fiscal excluding the effect of the charge from the fairfield closure and one time severance costs  net income would have been higher by million and respectively 
the remaining decrease was primarily from the decline in the energy systems business and to a lesser degree the decline in the process systems segment and slightly higher interest costs  as discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales of million for fiscal were million  or higher than for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the acquired businesses 
pro forma sales  assuming all of the businesses owned at august  were owned for all of fiscal and fiscal  decreased by million or 
the process systems segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was all from acquired businesses 
on a pro forma basis sales were the same as fiscal sales were fiat in this segment as large project orders were cancelled or delayed due to the economic uncertainty of orders declined by more than sales in fiscal because of this uncertainty  resulting in backlog declining by million 
the energy systems segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was all from acquired businesses 
on a pro forma basis sales actually declined million or 
this decline was because of the steady drop in crude oil prices from per barrel in early fiscal to under per barrel by the end of fiscal backlog levels also dropped to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal the gross margin percent increased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to cost containment and positive contribution from the acquisitions 
ibit before amortization and other for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily from the acquired businesses  improved operating margins in the process systems segment and corporate cost reductions 
ibit before amortization and other as a percent of sales increased in the process systems segment to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily from cost containment programs and reductions in variable pay 
ibit before amortization and other as a percent of sales decreased in the energy systems segment to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was from the overall lower sales volumes and lower operating margins in the acquired fce business 
amortization expense increased to million from million in fiscal this increase is from the acquired businesses  primarily fce  and a full year of expense from the acquisitions 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this was due to higher average debt levels related to the acquisition costs of the acquired businesses  as the effective interest rate remained stable 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was due to a reduced benefit in fiscal from the utilization of loss carryforwards outside the us as these loss carryforwards were fully realized in and in certain countries 
net deferred income tax assets of million at august  primarily relate to us operations 
available carrybacks and future pretax income at recent levels would be sufficient to realize these assets 
net income of million was higher than for fiscal diluted income per share rose to compared to for fiscal the increases were from the acquisitions and higher operating margins in the process systems segment 
liquidity and capital resources the company s significant cash needs expected for fiscal are planned capital expenditures of million  cash needed for a share repurchase program announced in october and shareholder dividends 
the share epurchase program is a twelve month program to repurchase up to or  shares or share equivalents in the convertible notes 
the company expects cash flow from operating activities to be adequate for these needs 
there are no significant restrictions on the company s ability to transfer funds from its non us subsidiaries to the company 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company completed the share repurchase program to purchase up to of the company s outstanding shares  or about  shares 
in   shares were purchased by the company for million and  shares were purchased by the company s us defined benefit pension plan master trust master trust for million 
in fiscal   shares were purchased by the company for million and  shares were purchased by the master trust for million 
total purchases under this program were  shares for million 
in fiscal cash flow from operating activities was million 
this cash was primarily used for million of net debt repayments  million for capital expenditures  million for acquisitions and million to complete the share repurchase program 
in fiscal free cash flow  cash provided by operations less capital expenditures  was million  an increase of over fiscal despite lower income levels 
the company was able to react to the lower income levels and preserve free cash flow through working capital reductions and reduced capital spending in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities of million and net debt borrowings of million generated million of cash 
significant cash uses in fiscal were million for acquisitions  capital expenditures of million  million to fund the purchase of  shares through the share repurchase program and dividend payments of million year and euro certain software and hardware systems are time sensitive 
older time sensitive systems often use a two digit dating convention rather than that could result in system failure and disruption of operations as the year approaches 
this is referred to as the year issue 
the year issue will impact the company  its suppliers  customers and other third parties that transact business with the company 
each business unit within the company has a year team 
these teams identified issues related to substantially all hardware and software systems within the company  products sold by the company  and significant suppliers and other third parties that transact business with the company 
projects were established to address all significant year issues 
each year team reports regularly to senior management on the progress of significant year projects 
senior management reports to the board of directors quarterly on the company s progress with year projects 
most year activities were to test hardware and software systems  including non information technology systems such as telephones and cnc machines 
the company determined that it needed to replace or modify some of its software and hardware systems 
the company replaced most of the systems with year issues and reprogrammed only a few software systems 
the company believes it has no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for products sold as few company products contain time sensitive hardware or software systems 
the company initiated communications with significant suppliers  customers and other relevant third parties to identify and minimize disruptions to the company s operations from year issues 
however  there can be no certainty that the impacted systems and products of other parties on which the company relies will be year compliant 
the costs for resolving year issues were approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal most of these costs were to replace existing software and hardware systems 
the company believes it has diligently addressed the year issues and that it has satisfactorily resolved significant year problems 
the company believes it has no significant exposure to the introduction of the new euro currency

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk in its normal operations the company has market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates 
as a result of the company s global operations  it has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars 
the company s significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
the company manages its exposure to its net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing its us dollar net asset positions through maintaining a portion of its bank debt in italian lira and matching net asset positions in certain currencies with net liability positions in other currencies that move in similar directions in relation to the us dollar for example the italian lira and the german mark 
the company also enters into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps under established policies and guidelines  that enable it to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
the company does not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions  as established policies require that such hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
the company s main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  german marks  italian lira and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the dollar value of future non us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the company as of august   the company s net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
using this method the company s ibit and cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitor s products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of such potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
the company also has market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   the company has million in interest bearing debt obligations that are subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the company attempts to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
such a balance in the debt profile is expected to moderate the company s financing cost over time 
if long term corporate interest rates were to drop substantially  the company is limited in its ability to refinance its fixed rate debt 
however  the company does have the ability to change the characteristics of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve its objective of balance 
no such interest rate swaps are outstanding at august  at august   million of the outstanding debt is at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million is at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of the company s total debt at august   is approximately million 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities and related weighted average interest rates of the company s debt obligations at august   by maturity dates in thousands maturity us dollar us dollar italian lira date fixed rate variable rate variable rate amount rate amount rate amount rate thereafter  total
