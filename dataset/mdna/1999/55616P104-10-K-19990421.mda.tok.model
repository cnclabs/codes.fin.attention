year the company relies on computer based technology and utilizes a variety of third party hardware and proprietary and third party software 
the company s retail functions  such as merchandise procurement and distribution  inventory control  point of sale information systems and proprietary credit card account servicing  generally use proprietary software  with third party software being used more extensively for administrative functions  such as accounting and human resource management 
in addition to such information technology it systems  the company s operations rely on various non it equipment and systems that contain embedded computer technology  such as elevators  escalators and energy management systems 
third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships  including vendors of merchandise for resale by the company and of products and services used by the company in its operations such as banking and financial services  data processing services  telecommunications services and utilities  are also highly reliant on computer based technology 
in february  the company commenced an assessment of the potential effects of the year issue on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in conjunction with such assessment  the company developed and commenced the implementation of the compliance program described below 
the company s year compliance program proprietary it systems 
pursuant to the company s year compliance program  the company has undertaken an examination of the company s proprietary it systems 
all such systems that have been identified as relating to a critical function and as not being year compliant have been or are being remediated or replaced 
the company believes that the remediation of its proprietary it systems is substantially complete  and nearly all of the proprietary it systems that have been remediated have been installed and placed into production 
the company commenced testing of such remediated systems for year compliance in august and has completed a comprehensive  integrated test of all of its main frame and mid range it systems including third party and proprietary hardware  software  network components and interfaces 
the company is presently conducting varying levels of follow up testing of selected systems 
third party it systems 
the strategy instituted by the company to identify and address year issues affecting third party it systems used by the company includes contacting all third party providers of computer hardware and software to secure appropriate representations to the effect that such hardware or software is or will timely be year compliant 
the company has received year compliant versions of almost all third party software and is currently engaged in testing those third party software programs that have been identified as being critical to the company s operations 
the company is also developing contingency plans as to third party hardware and software used by the company in respect of which the company has not received adequate compliance assurances to date 
non it systems 
the company has undertaken a review of its non it systems and is in the process of implementing a remediation program in respect of those systems that are within the control of the company 
the company expects to complete this remediation effort by april  in addition  the company s centralized real estate department has communicated to the developers  landlords and property managers of substantially all of the company s properties the company s expectation that the systems utilized in the management and operation of such properties that are not within the company s control are or will timely be year compliant 
as a further step  the company plans to engage in written or oral communications with its key developers  landlords and property managers in order to assess the year readiness of their respective operations 
non it vendors and suppliers 
the company procures its merchandise for resale and supplies for operational purposes from a vast network of vendors located both within and outside the united states  and is not dependent on any one vendor for more than of its merchandise purchases 
the company procures its private label merchandise  which constitutes approximately of the company s total sales  principally from manufacturers located outside the united states 
all of the company s vendors have been notified in writing of the company s expectation that the systems and operations of such vendors will be year compliant before january  as a part of its contingency planning effort  the company has commenced making inquiries as to the year readiness of selected key vendors and private label manufacturers in order to identify any significant exposures that may exist and establish alternate sources or strategies where necessary 
as of january   approximately of the selected key vendors contacted had provided to the company written or oral assurances that they are in the process of implementing compliance programs that are intended to address the year issues affecting their respective operations 
contingency planning 
the company s year compliance program is directed primarily towards ensuring that the company will be able to continue to perform three critical functions i effect sales  ii order and receive merchandise  and iii pay its employees 
the company is currently gathering data in an effort to assess the potential effects on these mission critical functions of a failure of the company s year compliance program to be fully effective and  to the extent deemed appropriate  to develop a contingency plan to address such effects 
the company expects to complete its contingency plan by july  costs 
the company has incurred to date approximately million of costs to implement its year compliance program and presently expects to incur approximately million of costs in the aggregate  of which approximately represents capitalized expenditures for hardware purchases 
all of the company s year compliance costs have been or are expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
the company s year compliance budget does not include material amounts for hardware replacement because the company has historically employed a strategy to continually upgrade its main frame and mid range computer systems and to install state of the art point of sale systems with respect to both pre existing operations and in conjunction with the acquisitions and mergers effected by the company in recent years 
consequently  the company s year budget has not required the diversion of funds from or the postponement of the implementation of other planned it projects 
risks 
the novelty and complexity of the issues presented and the proposed solutions therefor and the company s dependence on the technical skills of employees and independent contractors and on the representations and preparedness of third parties are among the factors that could cause the company s year compliance efforts to be less than fully effective 
moreover  year issues present a number of risks that are beyond the company s reasonable control  such as the failure of utility companies to deliver electricity  the failure of telecommunications companies to provide voice and data services  the failure of financial institutions to process transactions and transfer funds  the failure of vendors to deliver merchandise or perform services required by the company and the collateral effects on the company of the effects of year issues on the economy in general or on the company s business partners and customers in particular 
although the company believes that its year compliance program is designed to appropriately identify and address those year issues that are subject to the company s reasonable control  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts in this regard will be fully effective or that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
