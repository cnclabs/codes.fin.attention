average balances the consolidated comparative statement analysis table sets forth a comparison of average daily balances  interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis and interest rates calculated for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  amounted to  for  an increase of  over  in as shown in the rate volume analysis table  the increase in net interest income in was attributable to higher net interest income from changes in volume of  reduced in part by a reduction in rates of  the volume related change resulted primarily from increases in investment securities partially offset by decreased average balances for loans see discussions on loan portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale and an increase in time deposits 
the rate related change was primarily the result of the decrease of interest earned on loans and investments being greater than the decrease on interest paid on deposits and debt 
net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  in increased  over the figure of  this increase was the result of growth in loans  investments  deposits and long term debt 
also affecting was the increase in interest rates earned on deposits exceeding the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

the interest spread was  and for  and  respectively 
the impact on earnings by the reduction in the interest spread was diminished in part by the  increase in of non interest bearing deposits 
the following table sets forth a rate volume analysis  which segregates in detail the major factors that contributed to the changes in net interest income for the years ended december  and  as compared to the respective previous periods  into amounts attributable to both rate and volume variances 
in calculating the variances  the changes were first segregated into changes in volume change in volume times the old rate  changes in rates change in rate times the old volume and changes in rate volume changes in rate times the change in volume 
the changes in rate volume have been allocated in their entirety to the change in rates

non performing loans the following discussion relates to the bank s non performing loans which consist of those on a non accrual basis and accruing loans which are past due ninety days or more 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the company views these loans as non accrual  but considers the principal to be substantially collectible because the loans are protected by adequate collateral or other resources 
interest on these loans is recognized only when received 
the table non accrual loans shows the balance and the effect on interest income of non accrual loans for each of the periods indicated 
there were  of loans on a non accrual status at december  the increase in non accrual loans during of  resulted from the deterioration of certain residential real estate and consumer loans

the company measures impairment of a loan based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
sfas no 
allows creditors to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans 
the company has identified a loan as impaired when it is probable that interest and principal will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the accrual of interest is discontinued in such loans and no income is recognized until all recorded amounts of interest and principal are recovered in full 
loan impairment is measured by estimating the expected future cash flows and discounting them at the respective effective interest rate or by valuing the underlying collateral 
the recorded investment in these loans and the valuation for credit loses related to loan impairment at december  and are as follows dollars in thousands at december  principal amount of impaired loans accrued interest deferred loan costs less valuation allowance at december  the activity in the allowance account for credit losses related to impaired loans is as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended valuation allowance at january  provision for loan impairment direct charge offs recoveries valuation allowance at december  total cash collected on impaired loans during was  of which  was credited to the principal balance outstanding on such loans  and  was recognized as interest income

the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in from was  in  the decrease in the provision was  from the allowance for possible loan losses is established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expenses 
loans are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio are managed through various control processes  including credit evaluations of individual borrowers  periodic reviews  diversification by industry  and the establishment of lending targets to various segments of the portfolio 
risk is further mitigated through the application of lending procedures such as the holding of adequate collateral and the establishment of contractual guarantees 
management believes that these procedures provide adequate assurances against the adverse impact from any event or set of conditions  and that the level of the allowance for possible loan losses is sufficient to meet the present and potential risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  including the current level of non performing and past due loans 
management ranks loans or portions thereof which present unfavorable factors according to the degree of collectibility 
such analysis and examinations form the principal foundation on which management makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses

impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
another significant effect of inflation is on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations 
year the company has adopted a year policy to address the year issue concerning the inability of certain information systems and automated equipment to properly recognize and process dates containing the year and beyond 
if not corrected  these systems and equipment could produce inaccurate or unpredictable results commencing on january  the company  similar to most financial services providers  is particularly vulnerable to the potential impact of the year issue due to the nature of financial information 
potential impacts to the company may arise from software  computer hardware  and other equipment both within the company s direct control and outside of the company s ownership  yet with which the company electronically or operationally interfaces 
in order to address the year issue  the company has developed and implemented a five phase compliance plan divided into the following major components awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and testing  and implementation 
the company has completed the first three phases of the plan for all of its mission critical systems and is currently working on the final two phases 
the company has identified its mission critical systems as those that affect the company s ability to process banking transactions and its general accounting systems 
such systems include deposit  loan and trust accounting  check and deposit processing and branch teller equipment 
the company purchases most of its computer software from major outside providers of bank software 
a significant component of the year plan is to install the year compliant software provided by these vendors and also to test these supplied systems 
the company s major software providers have informed the company that  based on tests they have conducted and continue to conduct  they believe their respective systems to be year compliant 
in addition  the company is conducting its own tests on these systems provided by vendors 
the company also has some internally generated programmed software 
this software has been corrected for year and is in final testing 
the company anticipates that all mission critical systems will be tested by june the company has reviewed the impact of year on other equipment and systems such as heating  air conditioning  telecommunications  electric service  vaults  photocopiers  personal computers  printers and other equipment where necessary 
some of this equipment  such as personal computers  has been replaced 
other items such as vaults  heating  air conditioning  photocopiers and printers have been tested and found not date sensitive 
the company s providers of telecommunications and electric service have been contacted 
these providers have indicated they do not expect any interruption of service in the year other important segments of the year plan are to identify those suppliers and customers whose possible lack of year preparedness might expose the company to financial loss 
included in this process was communications to all the company s customers and identification of loan and deposit customers whose failure to address the year issue might impact their banking relationship 
as a result of this communication  the company has identified those customers who may be affected by the year risk factors have been assigned to these customers 
the company does not anticipate any significant loss as a result of these risks 
the company has initiated communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company has developed contingency plans to address any or all systems that  despite all testing  still do not operate correctly in the year the contingency plans provide for manual and personal computer based systems to process checks  deposits and loan transactions 
the company will increase its inventories of the various required supplies  such as new account and loan forms  deposit withdrawal forms and other pre printed forms  available at the company s main office and branch offices 
alternative communications systems have been established and alternative power sources are being investigated 
these plans will be finalized and tested during the first half of at this time  the company cannot estimate the cost  if any  that might be required to implement such contingency plans 
during  the company spent  on year compliance matters 
as of december    has been spent on this project 
these expenses are comprised of the replacement of branch teller and new account systems for  replacement of personal computers for  replacement of mortgage lending software for  and enhancements to banking and trust systems of  additional expenses expected in include  for an alternative electric power system   for replacing an automated teller machine   for replacing additional personal computers   for branch new account systems   for additional mortgage lending software   for check processing software and  for other banking systems 
the expenses related to year are financed by the general revenues of the company and are included in the company s other operating expenses in the company s financial statement 
the company anticipates that its total year project cost will not exceed  this estimated project cost is based upon currently available information 
the aforementioned year project cost estimate also may change as the company progresses in its year program and obtains additional information and conducts further testing 
at this time  no significant projects have been delayed as a result of the company s year effort 
financial institution regulators have intensively focused upon year exposures  issuing guidance concerning the responsibilities of senior management and directors 
year testing and certification is being addressed as a key safety and soundness issue in conjunction with regulatory exams 
the federal banking agencies have highly prioritized year compliance in order to avoid major disruptions to the operations of financial institutions and the country s financial systems when the new century begins 
the federal banking agencies have been conducting year compliance examinations 
the failure to implement an adequate year program can be identified as an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the company and the bank are subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve bank and the comptroller of the currency which regularly conducts reviews of the safety and soundness of the company s operations  including the company s progress in becoming year compliant 
the regulatory agencies have established examination procedures which contain three categories of ratings satisfactory  needs improvement and unsatisfactory 
institutions that receive a year rating of unsatisfactory may be subject to formal enforcement action  supervisory agreements  cease and desist orders  civil money penalties  or the appointment of a conservator 
in addition  federal banking agencies will be taking into account year compliance programs when reviewing applications and may deny an application based on year related issues 
failure by the company to adequately prepare for year issues could negatively impact the company s banking operations  including the imposition of restrictions upon its operations by the comptroller of the currency 
despite the company s activities in regards to the year issue  there can be no assurance that partial or total systems interruptions or the costs necessary to update hardware and software would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and business prospects 
there is also no guarantee that the hardware  software and systems of third parties such as utility companies  other banks  computer services and supply companies  the federal reserve bank  other federal agencies and other vendors who provide services and supplies to the company will be free of unfavorable year issues 
the failure of such third parties could have a material adverse impact upon the company 
earnings per common share the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share in sfas no 
eliminates primary and fully diluted earnings per share and requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share 
basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock 
prior periods earnings per share calculations have been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative discussion about market risk market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since most of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are located at the bank  the majority of the company s interest rate risk is at the bank level 
as a result  most interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level see discussion on interest rate sensitivity 
the company and the bank operate as a community banking institution primarily in the counties of northampton  lehigh and monroe  pennsylvania 
as a result of its location and nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank makes real estate loans primarily in the counties adjacent to its operations and thus is subject to risks associated with those local economies 
the bank holds a concentration of residential real estate loans of total loans and commercial loans supported by real estate of total loans in its loan portfolio see note q of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these loans are subject to interest and economic risks 
the bank also originates residential real estate loans for sale in the secondary market 
such loans are identified as mortgage loans held for sale on the company s balance sheet and are subject to interest rate risk see discussion on mortgage loans held for sale 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps see discussions on investment securities and securities available for sale 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest income would change due to changes in the level of interest rates 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to reduce a company s vulnerability to future interest rate fluctuations and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income 
the bank s asset liability management committee meets semi monthly to examine  among other subjects  interest rates for various products and interest sensitivity 
rate sensitivity arises from the difference between the volumes of assets which are rate sensitive as compared to the volumes of liabilities which are rate sensitive 
a comparison of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities is monitored by the bank on a regular basis using several time periods 
the mismatch of assets and liabilities in a specific time frame is referred to as interest sensitivity gap 
generally  in an environment of rising interest rates  a negative gap interest sensitive liabilities being greater than interest sensitive assets in a given period of time will decrease net interest income  and in an environment of falling interest rates  a negative gap will increase net interest income 
assets and liabilities are allocated to a specific time period based on their scheduled repricing date or on an historical basis 
at december   assets of  of total assets were subject to interest rate changes within one year 
this compares to assets subject to interest rate changes within one year of  of total assets at the end of and  of total assets at the end of liabilities subject to rate change within one year were   and  in  and  respectively 
a negative one year gap position of  existed as of december  the gap positions at december  and were negative  and negative  respectively 
the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for the one year time frame was 
at the end of  compared to 
at the end of and 
at the end of the interest sensitivity analysis in the following table presents a sensitivity gap analysis of the company s assets and liabilities at december  for five time intervals 
the company s negative gap position for the one year time frame increased in as a result of an increase in interest bearing demand deposits with a maturity of one year or less and an extension of loan maturities 
the change in the deposit mix was due to consumer concerns over lower interest rates paid on deposits 
the change in loan maturities was due in part to customers refinancing at lower interest rates and the sale of residential mortgage loans 
management intends to continue to purchase adjustable rate securities  make adjustable rate loans  market longer term certificates of deposit and sell fixed rate mortgage loans to maintain an acceptable gap position 
interest sensitivity analysis over days days days years years total interest bearing deposits with banks   federal funds sold   inv securities       loans held for sale loans       other assets    total assets       non interest bearing deposits   int bearing deposits       securities sold under agreements to repurchase   long term debt    other   capital   total liabilities and capital       net interest sensitivity gap     cumulative int sensitivity gap   cumulative gap rsa rsl historically  non interest bearing deposits reflect insignificant change in deposit trends and  therefore  the company classifies these deposits over five years 
while using the interest sensitivity gap analysis is a useful management tool as it considers the quantity of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in a given time period  it does not consider the relative sensitivity to market interest rate changes that are characteristic of various interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
consequently  even though the company currently has a negative gap position because of the unequal sensitivity of these assets and liabilities  management believes that this position will not materially impact earnings in a changing rate environment 
for example  changes in the prime rate on variable commercial loans may not result in an equal change in the rate of money market deposits or short term certificates of deposit 
a simulation model is therefore used to estimate the impact of various changes  both upward and downward  in market interest rates and volumes of assets and liabilities on the bank s net income 
this model produces an interest rate exposure report that forecasts changes in the market value of portfolio equity under alternative interest rate environments 
the market value of portfolio equity is defined as the present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of changes in the market value of portfolio value at december  are as follows dollars in thousands at december  market value of percent of changes in rate portfolio equity change basis points  basis points  basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  basis points  basis points  the assumptions used in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates are based on management s consideration of past experience  current position and anticipated future economic conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the assumptions on which the calculations were based
