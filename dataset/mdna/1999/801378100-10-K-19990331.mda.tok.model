which are more fully described in item above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto found elsewhere in this report 
the addition of company operated and franchised restaurants associated with these transactions are the principal reasons for the significant differences when comparing results of operations for the period ending december  with the results of operations for the period ending december  the comparability of future periods will also be affected by the aforementioned transactions and may also from time to time be affected by the implementation of the company s acquisition strategy 
the costs associated with integrating new restaurants or under performing or unprofitable restaurants  if any  acquired or otherwise operated by the company  may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenues  unless otherwise indicated  of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of income for the years indicated years ended december  revenues restaurant operations franchised restaurants and other total revenues restaurant operating costs food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits occupancy and other operating costs advertising pre opening expense general and administrative operating income loss interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss fiscal includes operating results of timber lodge  jb s restaurants and galaxy diner from and after september  as a percentage of revenues from company operated restaurants

for fiscal  food and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal the decrease in food and packaging costs was the direct result of lower food and packaging costs negotiated with vendors in payroll and other employee benefits increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the increase is attributable to the addition of jb s and timber lodge in fiscal which operate with higher payroll and other employee benefits costs than green burrito 
for fiscal  payroll and other employee benefits costs decreased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal the decrease in payroll and other employee benefits costs was primarily due to the increase in same store sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal occupancy and other operating costs decreased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal as compared with in fiscal the decrease in occupancy and other operating costs is attributable to the addition of jb s restaurants and timber lodge in fiscal which operate with lower occupancy and other costs than green burrito 
occupancy and other operating costs were constant at of revenues in fiscal and fiscal advertising costs increased to of sales in fiscal as compared with and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in advertising costs is entirely due to the addition of jb s restaurants and timber lodge in fiscal which typically spend three to four percent of sales on advertising costs 
pre opening expense of  in fiscal represents costs associated with the conversion of three jb s restaurants to timber lodge steakhouse restaurants in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal as compared with in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues is attributable to the addition of jb s restaurants and timber lodge which  are primarily comprised of company operated restaurants that operate with significantly lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales than the primarily franchise oriented operations of the company prior to the acquisitions 
for the years ended december  and general and administrative expense was million and million  respectively  representing and  respectively  of total revenues 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to is primarily the result of decreased corporate expenses relating to the downsizing of the corporate office and staff which were the result of the management change that occurred in interest expense primarily reflects interest costs associated with capitalized real property leases associated with jb s restaurants 
other income  net primarily reflects interest income on invested cash  short term investments and notes receivable 
other income  net increased by  or in fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase is mostly attributable to higher cash and short term investment balances in fiscal as compared with fiscal other income  net of  in fiscal was only slightly higher than the  of other income  net generated in fiscal year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of data sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company is investigating the impact of the year problem on its business  including the company s operational  information and financial systems  as well as the operational systems of the businesses recently acquired by the company 
based on the preliminary review of the company s existing and recently acquired businesses  the company does not expect the year problem  including the cost of making the company s computerized information systems year compliant  to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in future periods 
however  the inability of the company to resolve all potential year problems in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company has also initiated communications with significant suppliers and vendors on which the company relies in an effort to determine the extent to which the company s business is vulnerable to the failure by these third parties to remediate their year problems 
while the company has not been informed of any material risks associated with the year problem on these entities  there can be no assurance that the computerized information systems of these third parties will be year compliant on a timely basis 
the inability of these third parties to remediate their year problems could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company s review of its information systems and those of the businesses recently acquired indicates that the point of sale cash register systems in certain restaurants must be replaced 
in addition  the company will have to modify certain applications and replace some of the hardware used in the processing of financial information 
in conjunction with these upgrades  which are expected to be completed by the end of september   the company believes it will have addressed any potential significant year issues 
total expenditures related to the upgrade of the information systems are expected to range from million to million 
as of december   the company has incurred and expensed approximately  of expenditures consisting of internal staff costs  as well as outside consulting and other expenditures related to this upgrade process 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
to the extent possible  the company will be developing and executing contingency plans designed to allow continued operation in the event of failure of the company s or third parties computer information systems 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  and  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million and million respectively  which expire in the years through at december  and  the company had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively  which expire in the years through utilization of the carryforwards will be limited to specific amounts each year 
these net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately million as of december  however  sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
due to the uncertain nature of the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset based upon the company s past operating performance and expiration dates of the loss carryforwards  the company established a valuation allowance against these carryforward benefits 
the benefits would be recognized only as reassessment demonstrates they are realizable  which is entirely dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions 
while the need for this valuation allowance is subject to periodic review  if the allowance is reduced  the tax benefits of the carryforwards will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of the company s income tax expense 
effect of inflation 
food and labor costs are significant inflationary factors in the company s operations 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the statutory minimum wage  therefore  increases in the minimum wage increase the company s costs 
in addition  most of the company s leases require it to pay base rents with escalation provisions based on the consumer price index  in addition to percentage rentals based on revenues  and to pay taxes  maintenance  insurance  repairs  and utility costs  all of which are expenses subject to inflation 
the company has generally been able to offset the effects of inflation to date through small menu price increases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to offset the effects of inflation through menu price increases

liquidity and capital resources 
the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  and million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to the company s receipt of million from the exercise of  common stock purchase warrants by fidelity in connection with the company s acquisition of timber lodge steakhouse and jb s restaurants on september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities was  during fiscal the company used million in cash to pay down accounts payable and accrued payroll liabilities assumed in the acquisition of jb s restaurants 
additionally  the company used  to purchase inventory and other current assets 
these cash outflows were offset by net income and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
investing activities required the company to use million in cash to fund million of capital additions partially offset by net cash received from acquisitions of  and  in proceeds from the sale of one jb s restaurant that had been previously closed 
financing activities generated million of cash primarily as result of the receipt of million from the exercise of  common stock purchase warrants by fidelity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities at december  was compared to at december  the dramatic change in liquidity from to is due to the acquisition of jb s restaurants and timber lodge steakhouse  both of which operate with a significant negative working capital balance as result of the relatively small receivable and inventory balances carried by each which typically turn faster than accounts payable to vendors 
during fiscal the company completed the conversion of three under performing jb s restaurants to the timber lodge steakhouse concept at an average conversion cost of approximately  including pre opening costs 
a fourth jb s to timber lodge conversion was completed on january  the company expects to complete two additional jb s to timber lodge conversions during fiscal in addition  in  the company plans to begin remodeling certain jb s restaurants to improve and update the customer areas of the restaurants 
these remodels are expected to cost between  and  per restaurant and the company plans to complete between and of these remodels in the company expects to fund jb s conversions to timber lodge and jb s remodels through available cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
during the first quarter of  the company will begin replacing certain point of sale cash registers in the company s restaurants and other hardware in order to meet year requirements 
the company expects to utilize equipment lease financing to fund the anticipated million to million cost of these replacements 
the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  including acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity and or debt financings  the sale of assets or from other sources 
in addition  substantially all of the real properties owned by the company and used for its restaurant operations are unencumbered and could be used by the company as collateral for debt financing  however  there can be no assurance that real estate financing or other financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company 
market risk 
the company maintains investments in the publicly traded common stock of certain affiliated companies 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these securities at december   was million 
the potential loss in fair value  using hypothetical and declines in prices  is estimated to be approximately  and million  respectively 
such loss in fair value would not impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  unless the company liquidated their investments in affiliated companies  as such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  such investments will not be adjusted to market value unless an other than temporary impairment exists 
at march   the fair value of the company s investment in the common stock of affiliated companies approximated million
