item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  this report may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including manufacturing risks associated with implementing new process technology  achieving commercial scale manufacturing levels  achieving consistent yields and quality  uncertainty of market acceptance and the timing of market acceptance  as well as other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including the company s registration statement on form s filed on december   as amended through february  these risks i have materially and adversely affected  and may in the future materially and adversely affect  the company s results and ii have caused and may in the future cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by bolder 
general since its inception in march  bolder technologies corporation the company has been a development stage company  principally engaged in the research and development of its thin metal film tmf r battery technology  and has devoted significant resources to the development of its technology and processes to manufacture its tmf batteries 
in may  the company moved to a new  square foot leased manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters in golden  colorado 
this facility has been designed to accommodate multiple production lines and two research and development lines  as well as all of the company s other operations 
the company had disclosed in early february that the qualification of its first high volume manufacturing line for producing a sub c cell had proceeded more slowly than originally anticipated  due to the late delivery and installation of equipment and the time involved in initially testing and debugging of the line 
since february  the company focused on making key modifications to the production line and completing the debugging  testing  and qualification process 
in september  the company completed this process 
in october  the company introduced its sub c cell  which can be used as a modular building block for various battery packs 
based on the sub c cell  the company also introduced a modular line of battery packs known as its tmf rebel rechargeable battery packs 
the company is currently producing a few thousand sub c cells per month for sampling  to fulfill small orders and for experiments to improve the production process and product performance 
the company believes that the task of improving the efficiency of its first production line  the efficiency of the overall manufacturing process  and the performance of its tmf products will be an ongoing activity  as with any new process technology  even beyond the start of commercial operations 
additional modifications will be required from time to time to improve the production capability of the line 
similarly  changes in the design of the company s products will be required from time to time to improve product performance 
as with any new enabling technology  the company expects to go through a period of market adoption in which customers test and evaluate the bolder tmf batteries  subsequently designing the batteries into customer s products 
initially  the company expects modest product shipments until significant numbers of customers have completed this process 
the company expects to generate revenues primarily from the sale of its tmf batteries 
the company does not expect a significant volume of product shipments and resulting revenues prior to the second half of in june  the company and jci established a joint venture the joint venture to develop high volume manufacturing technology for tmf batteries  to manufacture tmf batteries for sale by both partners and to pursue hev battery development opportunities for tmf batteries 
in  having substantially completed its primary objective of developing the high volume manufacturing technology  the company and jci announced a new relationship  which replaced the joint venture effective as of july under the terms of the new relationship  which was finalized in july  each party is separately implementing tmf battery manufacturing facilities to best meet the unique requirements of the markets addressed by each 
in connection with the agreement to discontinue the joint venture  bolder received a cash payment from jci  as well as all of the tangible net assets of the joint venture 
in return  bolder granted jci certain royalty bearing licenses and committed to provide certain technology transfer services 
the company completed all of its obligations to provide technology transfer services to jci in all of the licenses are royalty bearing  and certain of the licenses are subject to minimum royalties and minimum performance criteria 
bolder and jci also entered into a cross supply agreement with commitments to supply the other party with minimum quantities of tmf battery products for several years 
the company believes that its results of operations to date may not be indicative of results in future periods 
future operating results may be affected by a wide range of factors and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues decreased to  in from  in as in previous reporting periods  the majority of revenues resulted from research and development services r d 
revenues from product sales decreased to  in from  in and are expected to remain at nominal levels until the company has gone through a period of market adoption by customers and commercial operations begin to increase 
approximately and percent of the  and  of r d revenues in and  respectively  resulted from the company s recognition of revenue from services performed in connection with the technology transfer arrangement with jci 
the remainder of the r d revenues in and  respectively  resulted from customer funded research and development programs 
the r d revenues associated with the jci agreement were non cash items in the technology transfer agreement with jci was completed in  and no additional r d revenues will be recognized beyond from this agreement 
the company considers r d revenues as an insignificant part of the future of the business 
cost of revenues decreased to  in from  in most of the decrease in was due to lower levels of customer funded product development programs compared to research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in was primarily due to additional technical staff and associated expenses  and new manufacturing facility and production line expenses related to the company s expanded efforts to commercialize its sub c cell and to implement high volume manufacturing 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  in compared to  in the small decrease in reflected lower expenses for legal fees and recruiting and relocation than in the prior year 
selling and marketing expenses increased to  in compared to  in the increases in were primarily due to increased staffing levels and small amounts of advertising expenses associated with the commercial introduction of the company s products 
interest income increased to  in from  in this increase was due to larger invested cash balances in  primarily resulting from the company s private placement of series a preferred stock in october and proceeds from debt financing in march interest expense increased to  in  compared to  in the increases in were due to increased levels of debt financing 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company received revenues from services provided under a technology transfer agreement with jci  from a small business innovation research sbir research and development agreement  from a customer funded development program and from the sale of batteries for testing and evaluation by customers 
r d revenues increased to  in from  in approximately percent of the r d revenues resulted from the technology transfer agreement with jci  which agreement did not exist in the remaining percent of r d revenues in and all of the r d revenues resulted from a combination of both private customer funded and the sbir product development programs 
product sales revenues increased to  in from  in and were expected to remain at nominal levels until the beginning of high volume production 
cost of revenues increased to  in from  in the increase was a result of higher costs directly related to commercial and government funded product development programs 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in  primarily due to additional technical staff and associated expenses and new manufacturing facility expenses related to the company s increased efforts to commercialize its sub c cell and prepare to implement high volume manufacturing 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was due to additional administrative staffing and added expenses for insurance  legal and investor relations 
also  included in the expenses were  of costs printing  legal and accounting associated with the registration statement filed in february and withdrawn in may selling and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to increased marketing and business development activities related to the company efforts to obtain new customers for future delivery of product 
interest income increased to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from slightly higher average cash balances invested during than in interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from increased levels of lease and debt financing in year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company received revenues from a customer funded development program  from the sale of batteries for testing and evaluation by customers  and from an sbir research and development agreement 
total revenues increased to  in from  in  primarily from a customer funded product development program 
product sales in and were nominal and were expected to remain at nominal levels until the beginning of high volume production 
cost of revenues increased to  in from  in the increase was a result of increased costs directly related to commercial and government funded product development programs 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in  primarily due to the company s increased efforts to commercialize its sub c cell and develop its manufacturing process 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was due to additional administrative staffing and added expenses for insurance  legal and investor relations associated with becoming a public company 
selling and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to increased marketing and business development activities related to the company s efforts to heighten customer interest as the company increased efforts to commercialize its sub c cell 
interest income increased to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from investment of the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering and from the exercise of warrants by stockholders in april interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease resulted primarily from the absence of debt service in on convertible promissory notes issued to certain stockholders in march  which were converted into common stock in may liquidity and capital resources from its inception through december   the company has financed its operations and met its capital requirements primarily through private and public offerings of its equity securities  raising net proceeds of million from sales of these securities 
the company has also received net proceeds of million from a debt agreement with transamerica business credit corporation 
at december   the company s balances of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities totaled million  compared to million at december  in october  the company received approximately million in net proceeds from the private placement of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
the first dividend payment  in the form of shares of the company s common stock  was made on march   resulting in the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
the total amount of this dividend payment  representing the period from october  through march   was  an additional dividend payment  in the form of shares of the company s common stock  was made on june  this resulted in the issuance of  shares 
the total value of the dividend payment  which covered the period from march  through june   was  a dividend payment in the amount of  made on december   for the period from july  through december   resulted in the issuance of  shares of bolder common stock 
in march  the company obtained loan proceeds of million from its debt agreement with transamerica business credit corporation tbcc 
the company has no additional financing available from the tbcc debt agreement 
the remaining loan balance  which is collateralized by tenant improvements and the high volume production line  is million at december  as of december   the company had made payments of million to fund the construction of its first high volume production line  of which million were financed through its debt agreement with tbcc 
the company has no additional obligations to the supplier of its production line 
in  the company invested approximately million in leasehold improvements  machinery  equipment  and office furnishings to support its new facility and its development  production  sales and administrative activities 
except as noted above  the company currently has no other significant capital commitments other than its commitments under notes payable 
the company believes that its existing sources of liquidity and projected cash generated from operations will satisfy the company s funding requirements at least through year end to provide funds for future production lines  the company will need to access additional sources of equity capital or debt 
if these financing sources are not available  the company would likely delay any substantial expansion of fully automated manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate revenues and operating income sufficient to satisfy its working capital and equipment expenditure needs in the future 
in addition  the company is unable to predict the precise amount of future capital that it may require  and there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the company if that need arises or that financing will be in a form or on terms acceptable to the company 
the inability to generate revenues and operating income or obtain required financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
consequently  the company could be required to significantly reduce or suspend its operations  seek a merger partner or sell additional securities on terms that could be dilutive to the company s stockholders 
income taxes net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million are available to reduce taxable income as of december  the net operating loss nol carry forwards expire from through the company has not paid income taxes since its inception 
the tax reform act of and other income tax regulations contain provisions which may limit the nol carry forwards available to be used in any given year  if certain events occur  including significant changes in ownership interests 
a change of ownership of a company greater than percent within a three year period results in an annual limitation on the company s ability to utilize its nol carry forwards from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
the private placement sale of series a convertible  redeemable preferred stock in october resulted in such a change of ownership  and the company estimates that the resulting nol carry forwards limitation will be approximately million per year for periods subsequent to october  the company does not believe that this limitation will affect the eventual utilization of its total nol carry forwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance for the entire amount of its deferred tax asset since inception due to its history of operating losses 
year state of readiness 
the company relies on software in its information systems and manufacturing equipment 
most of this equipment and software was installed and written within the past three years 
the company has completed an inventory of its critical control systems  computers  and application software 
costs 
the company has a plan to validate each of these systems by the end of third quarter this plan of total expected hours completed to march  will be accomplished through a combination of written vendor confirmations and specific validation testing 
the company has contracted with third party vendors to assist in planning tests and or testing these systems 
cost of the testing and validation phase are not expected to exceed  including consulting and internal resources 
due to the fact that the company s information and embedded systems are new  generally off the shelf  and vendor relationships still exist for the subject equipment and software  year remediation costs are expected to be relatively small 
they are expected to consist of replacing relatively low cost personal computers  and installations of bug fixes from major manufacturers of equipment  along with some customer software fixes 
these costs  including hardware replacements accelerated by the year situation  and other contingency plan activities  are not expected to exceed  risks 
the most likely risks to the company from year issues are external  due to the difficulty of validating key third parties readiness for year the company will seek confirmation of such compliance and seek relationships that are compliant 
however  the risk that a major supplier of raw materials  or a major oem customer  will become unreliable due to year problems will still exist 
the company will maintain contingency plans for each of these key relationships as they arise  such as second sourcing  purchasing additional inventory  and creating joint contingency plans for year situations with each relationship
