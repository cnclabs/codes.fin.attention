item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s principal product is its clave needleless iv connection system 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by product as a percentage of total net sales product line clave click lock mcgaw protected needle lopez valve and other rf rf rhino budget medical products mcgaw safeline revenue sharing total the company sells its products to independent distributors and through strategic supply and distribution agreements with b 
braun mcgaw and abbott the b 
braun mcgaw agreement and the abbott agreement  respectively 
most independent distributors handle the full line of the company s products 
b 
braun mcgaw and abbott both purchase clave products  principally bulk  non sterile connectors 
b 
braun mcgaw also purchases the mcgaw protected needle and abbott also purchases the rhino  a low priced connector specifically designed for abbott 
through  both agreements established minimum transfer prices and a revenue sharing formula under which the company could receive more than the minimum transfer prices based on selling prices of products incorporating the company s products 
the b 
braun mcgaw agreement provided for revenue sharing based on b 
braun mcgaw s selling prices of clave products and the abbott agreement provided for revenue sharing based on abbott s selling prices of both clave products and rhinos 
effective august   the abbott agreement was amended to establish fixed selling prices for rhinos and eliminate revenue sharing  and effective january   both the abbott and b 
braun mcgaw agreements were amended to establish fixed selling prices on clave products and eliminate revenue sharing on clave products 
in june  b 
braun melsungen ag b 
braun acquired mcgaw from ivax corporation 
in june  the company and b 
braun mcgaw concluded a new definitive agreement effective as of january  the new agreement extends the prior agreement for clave products from june to december  has extension provisions beyond then  and generally reduces prices 
in january  the company and abbott agreed to a significant expansion of their agreement for clave products 
the new agreement has assurances of substantial increases in sales volume  accompanied by price reductions 
the agreement is extended from april to december and designates the company as abbott s preferred supplier for all abbott s needlefree technology 
the company believes that as the healthcare provider market continues to consolidate  the company s success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on the company s ability  either independently or through strategic supply and distribution arrangements  to secure long term clave contracts with major buying organizations 
further  the company s marketing and distribution strategy may result in a significant share of the company s revenues being concentrated among a small number of customers 
the loss of a strategic supply and distribution agreement with an iv product manufacturer such as b 
braun mcgaw or abbott or the loss of a large contract by such a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
management believes the success of clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
the company is aware of a number of such products 
in response to competitive pressure felt in the third quarter of  the company since october has been reducing prices 
management expects that the average price of its clave products will continue to decline 
there is no assurance that the company s current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
comparison of to in  the company reported net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the most significant factor in the increase was a  or  increase in clave net sales 
net sales in all of the company s other product lines were equal to or more than those for  except for a decrease in click lock and piggy lock net sales 
the company s independent distributors accounted for of the company s net sales in  with mcgaw accounting for and abbott the remaining 
in  the comparable percentages were  and  respectively 
total clave net sales increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with b 
braun mcgaw and abbott accounting for the entire unit growth 
unit sales to independent distributors were down slightly 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to b 
braun mcgaw and abbott  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted for by bulk  non sterile claves 
net sales to b 
braun mcgaw  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave net sales to b 
braun mcgaw increased approximately  principally because of an increase in unit shipments 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle were virtually unchanged  but management expects those sales to decline in the future as the market for safe connectors continues its shift to needleless technology 
management expects increases in unit shipments to b 
braun mcgaw in  although there is no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
under an agreement with b 
braun mcgaw  the company receives revenue sharing payments on b 
braun mcgaw s sales of its safeline products  such payments commenced in  and the company recorded estimated revenue sharing of approximately  in  as compared with  in although management anticipates that such revenue sharing will continue  the actual amount will depend on the volume and selling prices of b 
braun mcgaw s safeline products  which management has no means of forecasting accurately 
net sales to abbott amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave sales were times the amount in most of the balance of the sales were in the low priced rhino  which were  as compared with  in based upon the terms of the abbott agreement as amended in january  management expects a substantial increase in clave unit and dollar sales volume with abbott in  although there is no assurance as to the amount of such increase 
management expects that unit sales of clave to its independent distributors in will be approximately the same as in or slightly lower 
although management had expected that the price reductions commenced in october  which have aggregated by the end of  would eventually be more that offset by increased volume  this has not occurred to date for independent distributors in the aggregate 
there is no assurance that independent distributors will achieve increased unit volume in the future 
further  the ability of the independent distributors to sustain their unit sales may be impacted by competition from existing and new competitive products or acquisition of clave market share by abbott and b 
braun mcgaw 
management expects to encounter continued pricing pressure from individual end users  and expects continued declines in net prices to the independent distributors 
net sales of click lock and piggy lock decreased in as compared to  because of the safe connector market s continued shift to needleless technology 
management expects that decline to continue 
the lopez valve showed a growth in net sales as compared to principally because of increased unit shipments 
management expects continued increases in lopez valve net sales in the company s subsidiary bmp  which markets custom iv sets  recorded  net sales in as compared to  in  its second year of operations 
most of the increase in net sales was because of increased unit shipments of custom iv sets incorporating the clave 
bmp s production is relatively labor intensive  resulting in a generally lower gross profit margin than for the company s other products 
bmp had a small gross profit in and the company is currently taking steps aimed at expanding bmp by increasing systems capabilities  improving manufacturing efficiency  reducing labor cost and enhancing distribution 
because significant innovation is required to achieve these goals  there is no assurance that these steps will achieve the desired results 
however  even if they are successful  management expects that gross profit margins in bmp will be lower than those historically recorded by the company because production of its products is relatively labor intensive 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in as compared to  in those amounts do not include distribution in canada in april  boc ohmeda ab ohmeda  the company s principal distributor in europe  sold its european distribution to a competitor of the company  and the company has terminated substantially all distribution by ohmeda since august the company is currently arranging alternative distribution in europe  although there is no assurance that satisfactory alternative distribution arrangements will be made 
the company believes that the loss of distribution through ohmeda did have an adverse effect on the growth of european sales 
to enhance growth of the european distribution  the company has hired four additional product specialists in europe bringing to six the total in europe 
management expects that its sales to european and other foreign distributors will continue to increase in the future 
gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the shift in sales mix toward a higher percentage of the relatively higher margin clave products  continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive production automation  and the increased absorption of overhead by higher production volumes offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
the company expects that its unit production costs will continue to decrease in as unit volumes increase  but that the gross margin percentage will be equal to or slightly lower than that achieved in as average unit sales prices continue to decrease 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by approximately  to  in  as compared to  in sg a costs were of net sales in as compared with in the increase in sg a costs was primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the company s domestic expansion of the clave product line  growth of bmp  expansion of the international sales efforts  and legal fees 
management expects sg a costs to increase in  because of growth in the company  increased domestic and international sales and marketing costs  promotional costs of new products and expansion of bmp 
research and development r d costs decreased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  as compared with approximately  or of sales  in management estimates that r d costs in will continue at approximately the same percentage of net sales as in however  r d costs could differ from those estimates and the r d may not be completed as expected 
the operating margin decreased to in  compared with in  principally because sg a increased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income increased from to  principally because of an increase in invested funds 
the company s effective income tax rate in was  approximately the same as in management expects its effective tax rate in to be equal to or slightly higher than the rate 
income from operations increased  as the increase in operating expenses of exceeded the increase in gross profit 
net income increased 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income  principally because the increase in the price of the company s stock increased the dilutive effect of stock options 
comparison of to in  the company reported net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the most significant factor in the increase was a  or  increase in clave net sales  including revenue sharing from b 
braun mcgaw on sales of clave products 
net sales in all of the company s other product lines increased over  except for a decrease in click lock  piggy lock and mcgaw protected needle net sales 
the company s independent distributors accounted for of the company s net sales in  with b 
braun mcgaw accounting for and abbott the remaining 
in  the comparable percentages were  and  respectively 
total clave net sales increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with b 
braun mcgaw and abbott accounting for the entire unit growth 
unit sales to independent distributors were down slightly 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to mcgaw and abbott  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted by bulk  non sterile claves 
net sales to b 
braun mcgaw  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave net sales to b 
braun mcgaw increased approximately  principally because of an increase in unit shipments 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle declined 
estimated safeline revenue share was approximately  in  as compared with  in net sales to abbott amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave sales were  an increase of from the  in the balance of the sales were in the low priced rhino  which were  as compared with  in net sales of click lock and piggy lock decreased in as compared to the lopez valve showed a growth in net sales as compared to because of increased unit shipments 
bmp net sales recorded were  in as compared to  in  its first year of operations 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in as compared to  in gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the shift in sales mix toward a higher percentage of the relatively higher margin clave products and continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive production automation more than offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by approximately  to  in  as compared to  in as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in and in the increase in sg a costs was primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the company s domestic expansion of the clave product line  growth of bmp and expansion of the international sales efforts 
an increase in corporate expenses also contributed to the increase in sg a 
partially offsetting those increases was a decrease in the costs of patent litigation in which the company is the plaintiff from  in to  in research and development r d costs increased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  as compared with approximately  or of sales  in the increase related to efforts to complete development on a number of new products 
the operating margin increased to in  compared with in  principally because sg a decreased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income was essentially unchanged from to the company s effective income tax rate in was as compared with in  principally because tax exempt investment income decreased as a percentage of total taxable income 
income from operations increased  as the increase in operating expenses of trailed the increase in net sales and gross profit 
on a percentage basis  that increase in income from operations was partially offset by the essentially unchanged income from investments and a higher effective tax rate  resulting in a overall increase in net income 
net income per share increased  or due to the increase in net income  and the reduction in shares outstanding because of the purchase of shares for treasury 
the acquisition of treasury stock after considering the investment income that would have been earned if the shares had not been purchased  increased earnings per share by approximately for the year liquidity and capital resources during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities and  from exercise of stock options  partially offset by  of purchases of property and equipment 
during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased to  from  due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities  offset by  used to acquire treasury stock 
capital expenditures increased substantially in from the relatively low levels in through the increase related to the acquisition of land and construction of the facility in ensenada  baja california  mexico of approximately million  acquisition of production tooling and machinery of approximately million  and purchase of computer and other office equipment of approximately million 
management currently expects that capital expenditures for production tooling and machinery in will substantially exceed levels to meet expected increased sales volumes and to automate production of new products and that capital expenditures  of an amount yet to be determined  will be incurred to add to facilities n san clemente 
management expects that sales of the company s products will continue to grow in if sales continue to increase  accounts receivable and inventories are expected to increase as well 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects the use of working capital to fund its operations to continue to increase 
the company has not purchased treasury stock since august  except for  of shares purchased in august it may purchase additional shares in the future 
however  future acquisitions  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
the company believes that its existing working capital  supplemented by income from operations  will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
year compliance many older computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  they do not properly recognize a year that begins with rather than this is referred to as the year  or yk problem 
the yk problem has been eliminated in many new programs and systems  which are said to be yk compliant 
the company has completed its initial assessment of yk and believes  based on manufacturers specifications and subject to completion of testing in  that all its information technology it systems and applications and related hardware are yk compliant 
the company has not completed assessing yk compliance of its non it systems  principally manufacturing systems  but it believes that any non compliance will not affect the ability to use the related manufacturing equipment 
the company will attempt to assess in whether third parties with whom it deals  such as customers  vendors and governments have any yk problems that could affect the company  such problems could result in interruptions in delivery of services and materials and payments  among other things 
the company has not developed yk non compliance contingency plans  but will consider the need for such plans upon completion of the yk compliance assessments 
costs to assure yk compliance have so far been and are expected to remain nominal 
while the company is not currently aware of any yk compliance problems in its own systems  yk compliance of those systems cannot be assured until completion of testing 
further  the company cannot assure that the information it receives from third parties about their yk compliance will be meaningful or accurate 
failure to achieve compliance for the company s systems  or failure of significant third parties  with which the company deals to achieve yk compliance  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations
