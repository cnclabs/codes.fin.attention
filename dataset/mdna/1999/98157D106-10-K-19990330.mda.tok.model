the following discussion and analysis relates to the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december   after giving effect to the bfp merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
general the company is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the united states  serving local  long distance and internet customers domestically and internationally 
the company s operations have grown significantly in each year of its operations as a result of internal growth  the selective acquisition of telecommunications companies and international expansion 
on september   the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with mci 
through the mci merger  the company acquired one of the world s largest and most advanced digital networks  connecting local markets in the united states to more than countries and locations worldwide 
as a result of the mci merger  each share of mci common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of mci worldcom common stock or approximately million mci worldcom common shares in the aggregate  and each share of mci class a common stock outstanding all of which were held by bt was converted into the right to receive in cash or approximately billion in the aggregate 
the funds paid to bt were obtained by the company from i available cash as a result of the company s billion public debt offering in august  ii the sale of mci s imci business to cable wireless for billion in cash on september   iii the sale of mci s equity stake in concert to bt for billion in cash on september   and iv availability under the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program 
the mci merger was accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  operating results for mci have been included from the date of acquisition 
on august   mci acquired a voting interest and a economic interest in embratel  brazil s only facilities based national communications provider  for approximately r billion us billion 
the purchase price will be paid in local currency installments of which r billion us million was paid on august  with the remaining r billion us billion at december  to be paid in two equal installments over the next two years 
embratel provides interstate long distance and international telecommunications services  as well as over other communications services  including leased high speed data  satellite  internet  frame relay and packet switched services 
operating results for embratel are included from the date of the mci merger 
on january   mci worldcom  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with compuserve 
as a result of the compuserve merger  each share of compuserve common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of mci worldcom common stock  or approximately million mci worldcom common shares in the aggregate 
prior to the compuserve merger  compuserve operated primarily through two divisions interactive services and network services 
interactive services offered worldwide online and internet access for consumers  while network services provided worldwide network access  management and applications  and internet services to business 
the compuserve merger was accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  operating results for compuserve have been included from the date of acquisition 
on january   mci worldcom also acquired ans from aol  and has entered into five year contracts with aol under which mci worldcom and its subsidiaries will provide network services to aol 
as part of the aol transaction  aol acquired compuserve s interactive services division and received a million cash payment from mci worldcom 
mci worldcom retained the compuserve network services division 
ans provides internet access to aol and aol s subscribers in the united states  canada  europe and japan 
the aol transaction was accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  operating results for ans have been included from the date of acquisition 
on january   mci worldcom  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with bfp 
bfp is a leading facilities based provider of competitive local telecommunications services  commonly referred to as a competitive local exchange carrier  in selected cities within the united states 
bfp acquires and constructs its own state of the art fiber optic networks and facilities and leases network capacity from others to provide ixcs  isps  wireless carriers and business  government and institutional end users with an alternative to the ilecs for a broad array of high quality voice  data  video transport and other telecommunications services 
as a result of the bfp merger  each share of bfp common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of mci worldcom common stock or approximately million mci worldcom common shares in the aggregate 
the bfp merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  the company s financial statements for periods prior to the bfp merger have been restated to include the results of bfp for all periods presented 
on december   mci worldcom  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with mfs 
through this purchase  the company acquired local network access facilities via digital fiber optic cable networks installed in and around major united states cities  and in several major european cities 
the company also acquired a network platform  which consists of company owned transmission and switching facilities  and network capacity leased from other carriers primarily in the united states and western europe 
on august   mfs completed the uunet acquisition 
uunet is a leading worldwide provider of a comprehensive range of internet access options  applications  and consulting services to businesses  telecommunications companies and online service providers 
the company s strategy is to further develop as a fully integrated telecommunications company positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in global telecommunications 
consistent with this strategy  the company believes that transactions such as the mci merger  the compuserve merger and the aol transaction enhance the combined entity s opportunities for future growth  create a stronger competitor in the changing telecommunications industry and allow provision of end to end bundled service over global networks  which will provide new or enhanced capabilities for the company s customers 
the company s profitability is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to achieve line costs that are less than its revenues 
the principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges 
with respect to access charges on the interstate side  the us court of appeals for the us circuit is presently considering multiple appeals of the fcc s changes to the price cap system for regulating interstate access charges 
several pucs have initiated proceedings to address reallocation of implicit subsidies contained in the access rate and retail service rates to state universal service funds 
in addition  the fcc is presently considering further universal service reforms  access reform  and pricing flexibility for ilec access charges 
mci worldcom cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or whether or not the result s will have a material adverse impact upon its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  the company s goal is to manage transport costs through effective utilization of its network  favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies made possible as a result of expansion of the company s customer base through acquisitions and internal growth 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the company s statement of operations as a percentage of its operating revenues 
for the year ended december  revenues line costs selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization in process research and development and other charges operating income loss other income expense interest expense miscellaneous income loss before income taxes  minority interests and extraordinary items provision for income taxes income loss before minority interests and extraordinary items minority interests extraordinary items net income loss preferred dividends and distributions on subsidiary trust mandatorily redeemable preferred securities net income loss applicable to common shareholders year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenues for increased to billion as compared to billion for the increase in total revenues is attributable to the mci merger  the compuserve merger and the aol transaction as well as internal growth 
results for include mci and embratel operations from september  excluding embratel  the company s revenues increased to billion in prior year results have been restated to reflect the bfp merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
actual reported revenues by category and associated revenue increases for the year ended december  and reflect the following changes by category dollars in millions actual actual percent change revenues voice   data   internet  international  communication services   other total revenues before embratel   embratel  total reported revenues   the following table provides supplemental pro forma detail for mci worldcom revenues 
since actual results only reflect days of operations for mci and embratel  the pro forma results are more indicative of internal growth for the combined company 
the pro forma revenues  excluding embratel  for the year ended december  and reflect the following changes by category dollars in millions pro forma pro forma percent change revenues voice   data   internet   international  communication services   other   total revenues   pro forma results for the prior periods reflect a classification change for inbound international settlements which are now being treated as an offset to line costs instead of revenues 
previously  both mci and worldcom classified foreign post telephone and telegraph administration settlements on a gross basis with the outbound settlement reflected as line cost expense and the inbound settlement reflected as revenues 
this change better reflects the way in which the business is operated because the company actually settles in cash through a formal net settlement process that is inherent in the operating agreements with foreign carriers 
the following discusses the pro forma revenue increases for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma revenues for the comparable prior year period 
the pro forma revenues assume that the mci merger  compuserve merger and the aol transaction occurred at the beginning of these pro forma revenues do not include embratel or the imci business that was sold 
changes in actual revenues are shown in the consolidated statements of operations and the foregoing tables and  as noted above  primarily reflect the mci merger  compuserve merger  aol transaction and the internal growth of the company 
pro forma voice revenues for experienced a year over year increase driven by a gain of in traffic 
voice revenues include both long distance and local domestic switched revenues 
strong long distance volume gains in domestic commercial sales channels  combined with an increasing mix of local services  were the primary contributors to this increase 
pro forma local voice revenues grew in versus the same period of the prior year 
while the company continues to show significant percentage gains in switched local  it is still a relatively small component of total company revenues 
pro forma data revenues for increased year over year 
data revenues include both long distance and local dedicated bandwidth sales 
the revenue growth for data services continues to be driven by significant commercial end user demand for high speed data and by internet related growth on both a local and long haul basis 
this growth is not only being fueled by connectivity demands  but applications are becoming more strategic  far reaching and complex  additionally  bandwidth consumption is driving an acceleration in growth for higher capacity circuits 
rapidly growing demand for higher bandwidth services has contributed to a pro forma year over year local data revenue growth for as of december   the company had approximately million domestic local voice grade equivalents and approximately  buildings in the us  connected over its high capacity circuits 
domestic local route miles of connected fiber are in excess of  and domestic long distance route miles are in excess of  pro forma internet revenues for increased over the pro forma amount 
growth is being driven by both dial up and dedicated connectivity to the internet as more and more business customers migrate their data networks and applications to internet based technologies 
mci s internet revenues have been excluded from the above table  due to the divestiture of the imci business 
pro forma international revenues those revenues originating outside of the united states  excluding embratel  for were billion  an increase of as compared with million for the same pro forma period of the prior year 
significant percentage gains in international revenues are being achieved in continental europe in response to the company s rapidly expanding networks and sales effort 
in july  the pan european network was commissioned for service and now provides mci worldcom the capability to connect from end to end over  buildings in europe all over its own high capacity circuits 
in europe  the company has over route miles of local fiber and over  long distance route miles 
the pan european networks and national networks in the uk  france  germany and belgium are driving higher growth of enhanced data sales internationally 
the resulting revenue mix shift is contributing to improved margins in spite of the competitive pricing environment 
pro forma other revenues for were billion  down as compared with other revenues  which consists primarily of the operations of shl  include equipment deployment  consulting and systems integration and outsourcing services 
the year over year decline reflects the negative impact of eliminating certain lines of operation and the canadian currency translation effects 
in february  the company and eds announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell shl to eds for billion in cash 
in addition  both companies agreed to significant outsourcing contracts which will capitalize on the individual strengths of each company 
the definitive agreements for these outsourcing contracts will most likely be finalized in the second quarter of both transactions are subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals 
the following discusses the actual results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  line costs 
line costs as a percentage of revenues for were as compared to reported for the same period of the prior year 
overall decreases are attributable to changes in the product mix and synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the assimilation of mci  compuserve network services and ans into the company s operations and were offset in part by universal service fund costs recorded for the year 
additionally  access charge reductions beginning in july reduced total line cost expense by approximately million in while access charge reductions were primarily passed through to the customer  line costs as a percentage of revenues were positively affected by more than half a percentage point for the company anticipates that line costs as a percentage of revenues will continue to decline as a result of further synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the assimilation of the former mci and worldcom networks 
additionally  local revenues are increasing rapidly and line costs related to local are primarily fixed in nature leading to lower line costs as a percentage of revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were billion or of revenues as compared to billion or of revenues for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   which includes mci for days  reflects the company s expanding operations  primarily through the mci merger 
the company s goal is to achieve additional selling  general and administrative synergies in connection with the mci merger through the assimilation of mci into the company s strategy of cost control 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased to billion or of revenues from million or of revenues for the increase reflects increased amortization associated with the mci merger  compuserve merger and aol transaction and additional depreciation related to capital expenditures 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased due to the higher revenue base 
in process research and development and other charges 
in  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with the bfp merger  the mci merger  and certain asset write downs and loss contingencies 
such charges included million for employee severance  million for bfp direct merger costs  million for conformance of bfp accounting policies  million for exit costs under long term commitments  million for write down of a permanently impaired investment  and million related to certain asset write downs and loss contingencies 
the million related to long term commitments includes million of minimum commitments over the next one to ten years for leased facilities that the company has or will abandon  million related to certain minimum contractual network lease commitments that expire over the next one to three years  for which the company will receive no future benefit due to the migration of traffic to owned facilities  and million of other commitments 
additionally  the million related to certain asset write downs and loss contingencies includes million for the decommission of certain information systems that have no alternative future use  million for the write down to fair value of certain assets held for sale that were disposed of in and million related to legal costs and other items related to bfp 
as of december   the company s remaining unpaid liability related to the above charges was million  consisting of million for severance  million related to exit costs under long term commitments and million of other loss contingencies 
cash outlays for the severance costs were paid in the first quarter of the majority of the remaining liability will be paid ratably over the next four quarters 
funding for this obligation will be financed by cash flow from operations 
in connection with the recent business combinations  the company made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development r d totaling million in the first quarter of related to the compuserve merger and aol transaction and billion in the third quarter of related to the mci merger 
the company used professional appraisal consultants to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development ipr d 
these allocations represent the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the respective business combinations  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates 
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the respective business enterprises were comprised of various types of assets  each possessing different degrees of investment risk contributing to the company s overall wacc 
intangible assets were assessed higher risk factors due to their lack of liquidity and poor versatility for redeployment elsewhere in the business 
in the mci  compuserve network services and ans analyses the implied wacc was  and  respectively  based on the purchase price paid  assumed liabilities  projected cash flows  and each company s asset mix 
returns on monetary and fixed assets were estimated based on then prevailing interest rates 
the process for quantifying intangible asset investment risk involved consideration of the uncertainty associated with realizing discernible cash flows over the life of the asset 
a discount range of to was used for valuing the ipr d 
these discount ranges were higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at that time 
the value of the ipr d projects was adjusted to reflect the relative value and contribution of the acquired r d 
in doing so  consideration was given to the r d s stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the projected cost to complete the projects 
the company believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the respective business combination 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
management expects to continue supporting these r d efforts and believes the company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the r d projects and the company cannot give any assurance that any will meet with either technological or commercial success 
if none of these r d projects are successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
the failure of any particular individual project in process would not materially impact the company s financial condition  results of operations or the attractiveness of the overall investment of mci  compuserve network services or ans 
operating results are subject to uncertain market events and risks which are beyond the company s control  such as trends in technology  government regulations  market size and growth  and product introduction or other actions by competitors 
the integration and consolidation of mci  compuserve network services and ans requires substantial management and financial resources 
while the company believes the early results of these efforts are encouraging  the mci merger  compuserve merger and aol transaction necessarily involve a number of significant risks  including potential difficulties in assimilating the technologies and services of these companies and in achieving the expected synergies and cost reduction

o value added applications security systems  application hosting  and multimedia systems 
at the date of the aol transaction  ans had a number of r d projects underway related to security systems  application hosting and multimedia systems 
in connection with a security system product called interlock  ans was developing next generation capabilities to render multiple local area network lan connections  simple network management protocol snmp support  and the selective use of java and activex protocols 
other r d efforts were related to distributed firewalls  firewall farm technology  new encryption technologies  and multiple lan interface capability 
a windows project involved substantially improving aspects of the server software intended to make it support a domain named system dns cache  firewall functionality  and remote administration 
ans also had several application r d projects underway that were aimed at the development of a set of software tools  which would culminate in a new complex web hosting product 
ans complex web hosting product was being developed to have near real time database replication across geographic location  which would allow ans  if successful  to maintain a company s web site on several servers 
as of the acquisition date  ans did not offer multimedia services over its network 
as a result  ans was conducting r d related to four multimedia services fax over ip  video over ip  voice over ip  and call centers 
r d activity included system and software design  development of prototype systems  and systems testing 
the most important r d efforts related to multimedia systems were development of priority routing 
in addition to ans security systems  application hosting  and multimedia r d projects  ans had undertaken a number of additional r d efforts to develop technologies that would allow customers to access the system from any platform and to create a new data warehouse 
in concert with these efforts  ans was also addressing the customer s use of reporting  query  and on line analytical processing olap tools 
achievements on the value added applications r d leading up to the acquisition included the design and development of certain software algorithms  unit testing  and limited system testing 
remaining efforts included additional design work  large scale testing  significant performance enhancements  and debugging 
ans expected to spend approximately million in and million in to complete the value added applications r d 
the risk of not completing these projects was considered to be medium to high risk 
failure to complete the r d would cause the company s future revenues and profits attributable to the r d not to materialize 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the contribution of the purchased in process technology to developing commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net future cash flows from the expected sales of such products  and discounting the net future cash flows to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the company expected to begin generating the economic benefits from the ans and compuserve network services projects in progress as they were completed 
at the time of valuation  the cost to complete all such projects was approximately million 
funding for completion of the in process projects was expected to be obtained from internally generated sources 
based on the cost incurred at the acquisition dates and the milestones achieved by ans and compuserve network services  in aggregate  ans projects were estimated to be approximately complete  while compuserve network services s projects were estimated to be approximately complete 
the allocation of purchase price for the compuserve merger and the aol transaction included allocations to developed technologies  assembled work force  customer relationships and tradenames which will be amortized on a straight line basis over years 
at the time of the allocation  total ans and compuserve network services stand alone revenues were projected to exceed billion within five years 
this level of revenues implied a cagr of approximately 
estimated total revenues from the acquired in process technology related to compuserve network services peaked in the year and steadily declined through as other new product and service technologies were expected to be introduced by the company 
estimated total revenues from the acquired in process technology related to ans peaked in the year and steadily declined through these projections were based on management s estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology  and the expected timing of new product introductions 
these projections  as well as the statements above regarding estimated costs of completion  the likelihood of successful completion  and other aspects of the ipr d projects in the future  which were made as of the time of the acquisitions  constituted forward looking statements  and were not made with a view to public disclosure and were based on a variety of estimates and judgements 
actual results may vary materially due to a number of significant risks  including  without limitation  uncertainties regarding future business  economic  competitive  regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the company s control 
no assurance can be given that such projections or other statements will be realized 
the company does not intend to update or supplement these projections or other statements in the future

the following table highlights the source of the company s internal growth by category 
the pro forma and actual revenue increases for and reflect the following increases by category dollars in millions mfs actual pro forma percent actual percent actual change change revenues voice    data   internet international communications services    other total revenues    the following discusses the results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to mfs pro forma results for the comparable prior year period 
changes in actual results of operations are shown in the consolidated statements of operations and the foregoing tables and  as noted above  primarily reflect the mfs merger and the internal growth of the company 
voice revenues increased in over the mfs pro forma amount 
this increase was primarily due to strong volume gains in both the retail and wholesale segments 
the company s narrowing gap between revenue and volume growth was driven by strong wholesale revenues  international settlement reduction pass throughs  access charge pass throughs  and product mix 
voice revenues includes both long distance and increasingly local switched revenues 
while the company showed significant percentage gains in switched local during  it was a relatively small component of total company revenues 
data revenues increased by in over the mfs pro forma amount 
the strong revenue growth for private line and frame relay continues to be driven by tremendous commercial end user demand for high speed data and by internet related growth 
data revenues includes both long distance and local bandwidth sales 
internet revenues for more than doubled to million 
the provisioning constraints experienced in mid were significantly overcome in the latter part of the third quarter of  and the strong demand for both dedicated and dial up access contributed to the resumption of strong sequential gains in the fourth quarter of international revenues those revenues originating outside of the us were million  for  up compared with the corresponding mfs pro forma period for this strong performance was due to continuing strong traffic growth in the united kingdom and a growing presence in continental europe for both switched services and  increasingly  high speed data services 
significant effort was taken in to prepare for the opening of national markets in european countries which provided additional growth and improved margins in other revenues for were million 
other revenues include network construction and system sales which each represent non recurring contract revenue streams that fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
operator services and broadcast operations were sold in the third quarter of the operator services and broadcast operations provided revenues of million in and million in the following discusses the actual results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  line costs 
line costs as a percentage of revenues for was as compared to reported for the same period of the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to changes in the product mix and synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the assimilation of mfs into the company s operations 
additionally  access charge reductions beginning in july reduced total line cost expense by approximately million in while access charge reductions were primarily passed through to the customer  line costs as a percentage of revenues was positively affected by approximately one percentage point 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to billion or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues as reported for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues on a reported basis resulted from the company s expanding operations  primarily through the mfs merger 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million or of revenues from million or of revenues for this increase reflects increased amortization associated with the mfs merger and additional depreciation related to capital expenditures 
in process research and development and other charges 
in  the company recorded charges for employee severance  employee compensation charges  alignment charges and costs to exit unfavorable telecommunications contracts 
also in  the company incurred non cash charges related to a write down in the carrying value of certain assets  including goodwill and equipment 
because of events resulting from the passage of the telecom act and changes in circumstances impacting certain non core operations  management estimates of the company s fair value of operating assets within its core and non core businesses resulted in a non cash charge of million after tax 
on a pre tax basis  the write down was million and included million for network facilities and million for non core business  primarily operator services goodwill 
fair value of the non core business was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows to be generated from those operations while the majority of the network facilities were recorded at net salvage value due to anticipated early disposal 
in  the company recorded a billion charge for ipr d related to the mfs merger 
the charge was based upon a valuation analysis of the technologies of mfs worldwide information system  the internet network expansion system of uunet  and certain other identified research and development projects purchased in the merger 
at the date of the mfs merger  the technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not yet been established and the technology had no future alternative uses 
the expense includes billion associated uunet and billion related to mfs 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense was million or of revenues  as compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher debt levels as the result of additional debt acquired with the mfs merger  higher capital expenditures and the fixed rate debt financings  offset by lower interest rates in effect on the company s variable rate long term debt 
provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for was of income before taxes 
the rate of is greater than the expected statutory rate of primarily due to the fact that amortization of the goodwill related to the mfs merger is not deductible for tax purposes and the placement of a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss nol carryforwards generated by bfp in excluding the nondeductible amortization of goodwill and the placement of the valuation allowance on certain bfp nols  the company s effective income tax rate would have been approximately

as of the expiration of the tender offers  mci worldcom had received valid tenders and consents from holders of approximately billion of bfp notes over of total outstanding 
the funds required to pay all amounts required under the tender offers were obtained by mci worldcom from available working capital and lines of credit 
in connection with the tender offers and related refinancings  mci worldcom recorded an extraordinary item of million  net of income tax benefit of million in the first quarter of on august   mci worldcom replaced its existing billion and billion revolving credit facilities the old credit facilities with billion in credit facilities consisting of billion amended and restated facility a revolving credit agreement facility a loans  a billion amended and restated facility b term loan agreement facility b loans and a new billion day revolving credit and term loan agreement facility c loans 
in the fourth quarter of  the company elected to repay the facility b loans and cancel the facility commitment of billion 
the funds used to repay facility b loans were obtained by the company from availability under the facility a loans and facility c loans collectively  the credit facilities and the commercial paper program 
the credit facilities provide liquidity support for the company s commercial paper program and will be used for other general corporate purposes 
the facility a loans mature on june  the facility c loans have a day term  which may be extended for up to two successive day terms thereafter to the extent of the committed amounts from those lenders consenting thereto  with a requirement that lenders holding at least of the committed amounts consent 
additionally  effective as of the end of such day term  the company may elect to convert up to billion of the principal debt outstanding under the facility c loans from revolving loans to term loans with a maturity date no later than one year after the conversion 
the credit facilities bear interest payable in varying periods  depending on the interest period  not to exceed six months  or with respect to any eurodollar rate borrowing  months if available to all lenders  at rates selected by the company under the terms of the credit facilities  including a base rate or eurodollar rate  plus the applicable margin

on august   the company completed a public debt offering of billion principal amount of debt securities 
the net proceeds of billion were used to pay down commercial bank debt  finance a portion of the approximately billion payment to bt and for general corporate purposes 
the public debt offering consisted of billion principal amount of notes due the notes due  which mature august   million principal amount of notes due the notes due  which mature on august   billion principal amount of notes due the notes due  which mature august  and billion principal amount of notes due the notes due and collectively with notes due  the notes due and the notes due  the notes  which mature august  the notes bear interest payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  commencing february  the notes are redeemable  as a whole or in part  at the option of the company  at any time or from time to time  at respective redemption prices equal to the greater of i of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments as defined therein plus a basis points for the notes due  b basis points for the notes due and the notes due  or c basis points for the notes due  plus in the case of each of clause i and ii accrued interest to the date of redemption 
at the time of the mci merger  mci had outstanding billion of mci senior debentures with rates ranging from to and maturing from january through june  and billion of mci senior notes with rates ranging from to and maturing from march through april additionally  mci had outstanding a note payable in annual local currency installments us billion at december  as a result of mci s purchase of embratel on august   and other debt including  without limitation  capital leases 
as noted below  the brazilian real has experienced significant devaluation against the us dollar since mci invested in embratel in august the company has designated the remaining billion note payable in local currency installments  resulting from the embratel investment  as a hedge of its investment in embratel 
as of december   the company recorded the change in value of the note as a reduction of the note payable with the offset through foreign currency translation adjustment in shareholders investment 
as of december   embratel had million of long term debt outstanding  of which approximately million was denominated in us dollars and million denominated in other currencies including the french franc  deutsche mark and japanese yen 
the effective cost to embratel of borrowing in foreign currencies  such as the us dollar  depends principally on the exchange rate between the brazilian real and the currencies in which its borrowings are denominated 
during the first quarter of  the brazilian real devalued against the us dollar by as much as 
if this devaluation is sustained  or worsens  embratel would record a charge to their earnings equal to the increase in the us dollar liability resulting from such devaluation 
the net effect to the company s operations would be of such charge after elimination of minority interests 
in january  the company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries redeemed all of its outstanding senior notes due january  the senior notes 
holders of the senior notes received of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to january  of per  aggregate principal amount of such senior notes 
the total redemption cost of million was obtained from available liquidity under the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program 
in connection with the mci merger  the company also acquired million aggregate principal amount of cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a  representing million shares outstanding preferred securities due june  which were previously issued by mci capital i  a wholly owned delaware statutory business trust the trust 
the trust exists for the sole purpose of issuing the preferred securities and investing the proceeds in the company s subordinated debt securities due june   the only assets of the trust 
the company and mci have unconditionally guaranteed  on a subordinated basis  all of the trust s obligations under the preferred securities 
for the year ended december   the company s cash flow from operations was billion  increasing from billion in the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to internal growth  synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies and selling  general and administrative cost savings achieved from the assimilation of recent acquisitions  including the mci merger into the company s operations 
in  the company s existing receivables purchase agreement generated additional proceeds of million  bringing the total amount outstanding to million 
the company used these proceeds to reduce outstanding debt under the company s existing credit facilities 
as of december   the purchaser owned an undivided interest in a billion pool of receivables 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled billion and included capital expenditures of billion and acquisition and related costs of billion 
primary capital expenditures include purchases of switching  transmission  communication and other equipment 
approximately billion is currently anticipated for transmission and communications equipment  construction and other capital expenditures in without regard to embratel or possible future acquisitions or the redeployment of possible shl proceeds into additional spending opportunities 
acquisition and related costs includes the costs associated with the mci merger  compuserve merger and aol transaction 
included in cash flows from financing activities are payments of million for dividends on the company s series a and series b preferred dividend requirements 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock 
dividends on the mci worldcom series b preferred stock accrue at the rate per share of per annum and are payable in cash 
dividends will be paid only when  as and if declared by the board of directors of the company 
the company anticipates that dividends on the mci worldcom series b preferred stock will not be declared but will continue to accrue 
upon conversion  accrued but unpaid dividends are payable in cash or shares of mci worldcom common stock at the company s election 
in may  the company exercised its option to redeem all of the outstanding mci worldcom series a preferred stock and related depositary shares 
prior to the redemption date  substantially all of the holders of series a preferred stock elected to convert the preferred stock into mci worldcom common stock  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of mci worldcom common stock 
in connection with the mci merger  mci worldcom paid bt in cash without interest for each of the shares of mci class a common stock it owned  or approximately billion in the aggregate 
additionally  mci worldcom paid bt a fee of million to induce bt to terminate the previously signed bt mci merger agreement and to enter into the bt agreement 
mci worldcom funded the commitment through a combination of available cash from the august public debt offering and proceeds from the sale of the imci business and mci s investment in concert and availability under the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program 
increases in interest rates on mci worldcom s variable rate debt would have an adverse effect upon mci worldcom s reported net income and cash flow 
the company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow to service mci worldcom s debt and capital requirements  however  economic downturns  increased interest rates and other adverse developments  including factors beyond mci worldcom s control  could impair its ability to service its indebtedness 
in addition  the cash flow required to service mci worldcom s debt may reduce its ability to fund internal growth  additional acquisitions and capital improvements 
the development of the businesses of mci worldcom and the installation and expansion of its domestic and international networks will continue to require significant capital expenditures 
failure to have access to sufficient funds for capital expenditures on acceptable terms or the failure to achieve capital expenditure synergies may require mci worldcom to delay or abandon some of its plans  which could have a material adverse effect on the success of mci worldcom 
the company has historically utilized a combination of cash flow from operations and debt to finance capital expenditures and a mixture of cash flow  debt and stock to finance acquisitions 
absent significant capital requirements for other acquisitions  the company believes that cash flow from operations and available liquidity  including the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program and available cash will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs for the remainder of however  the company believes that funding needs in excess of internally generated cash flow and availability under the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program could be met by accessing the debt markets 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
this statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires a company to formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and cannot be applied retroactively 
sfas no 
must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  and  at the company s election  before january  
the company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
year readiness disclosure due to extensive use of computer technology  both mci and worldcom began developing strategic plans in to address their respective year issues 
since the mci merger  the company has consolidated these strategies into a single program 
the company s year compliance plan is an ongoing program in which remediation strategies are being implemented by the company s business organizations to address noncompliant computer and network systems and technology 
the company has a central project management organization that has overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation of this strategy 
the remediation strategies followed by the company s business organizations generally involve a sequence of steps that include i identifying computer hardware  software and network components and equipment potentially impacted by year problems  ii analyzing the date sensitivity of those elements  iii developing plans for remediation where necessary  iv converting non compliant code or equipment or  in some cases  replacing or decommissioning systems  v testing  and vi deploying and monitoring remediation solutions 
these steps will vary to meet the particular needs of a business organization and  in some cases  will overlap 
testing  for example  may be performed at several stages of the remediation process 
the company has substantially completed its efforts to identify and assess year computer issues  and its business organizations are in the process of developing remediation plans  converting noncompliant code or equipment  and replacing or decommissioning systems  and testing 
the company has targeted year compliance for the majority of its mission critical systems  including network and customer interfacing systems  on or before march  the remaining mission critical systems  and non mission critical systems  are targeted for compliance by june   with full deployment of the remediated solutions throughout the company s network targeted for completion by september the company is continuing to develop new systems and services that are expected to be implemented as year compliant throughout the year 
selected international  enhanced service platform systems and internal security scheduling mail systems are also expected to be implemented as year compliant in the third and fourth quarters of as part of its year plan  the company is seeking confirmation from its domestic and foreign interconnecting carriers collectively  the interconnecting carriers and major communications equipment vendors the primary vendors that they are developing and implementing plans to become year compliant 
the company has contacted these carriers and vendors  and will continue to do so  but has not yet received enough information from certain domestic and foreign carriers to assess their year readiness 
the company has received information from its primary vendors regarding their year readiness 
this information indicates the primary vendors have documented plans to become year compliant 
like all major telecommunication carriers  the company s ability to provide service is dependent on its interconnecting carriers and primary vendors 
the company is participating in industry efforts to test interoperability of networks for industry segments as well as multiple carriers 
the atis and network reliability and interoperability council nric testing are examples of this effort to assess the readiness of interconnecting carriers for both data and voice services 
the company is preparing contingency plans to address potential year related business interruptions that may occur on january  or thereafter 
the company anticipates that these contingency plans will primarily address potential year problems due to failures to remediate major systems successfully  or potential failure of the company s interconnecting carriers and primary vendors year compliance efforts 
the company is incorporating many of the recommendations of the nric into the contingency planning process 
the company plans to complete preparation and implementation of its contingency plans by december  failure to meet this target could materially impact the company s operations 
to achieve its year compliance plan  the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems for year compliance 
the company expects to incur internal labor as well as consulting and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare its systems for the year the company s use of internal resources to achieve its year compliance plan has not had a material adverse effect on its ability to develop new products and services or to maintain and upgrade  if necessary  its existing products and services 
the year costs incurred by mci and worldcom through december   which have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses for that period  were approximately million 
this level of expenditures is consistent with the planned expenditures for the period 
the company expects to incur approximately million expenses during to support its year compliance initiatives 
the costs of the company s year remediation efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which require assumptions about future events  availability of resources and personnel  third party remediation actions  and other factors 
there are no assurances that these estimates will be accurate  and actual amounts may differ materially based on a number of factors  including the availability and cost of resources to undertake remediation activities and the scope and nature of the work required to complete remediation 
the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of its interconnecting carriers and primary vendors  and other suppliers  as well as uncertainties related to the company s ongoing remediation program 
the company s year compliance plan is expected to reduce significantly the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its interconnecting carriers and primary vendors 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems  its interconnecting carriers and primary vendors year readiness  and completion of the year compliance plan as scheduled  it will maintain normal operations 
embratel s year program began in and is managed separately from the other mci worldcom year programs 
the embratel year program is intended to address all its systems  infrastructure  networks and applications and have them compliant by june  embratel has spent million of an estimated million on the year program and expects to come within the estimated costs 
embratel may  however  be affected by year problems to the extent that other entities are unsuccessful in achieving compliance 
despite preventive measures taken by embratel  no assurances can be given that the year issue will not have an effect on the financial condition and results of operations of embratel 
embratel is active in developing contingency plans and working with the international telecommunications union on interoperability testing 
statements concerning year issues which contain more than historical information may be considered forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  and readers are cautioned that the company s year discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s statement on forward looking statements which appears at the beginning of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro will be between january  to july  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been identified by the european commission with regard to the euro 
the company is currently evaluating methods to address the many issues involved with the introduction of the euro  including the conversion of information technology systems  recalculating currency risk  recalibrating derivatives and other financial instruments  strategies concerning continuity of contracts  and impacts on the processes for preparing taxation and accounting records 
at this time  the company has not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance as to the effect of the euro on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in market values of its investments 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
currently  the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
the company has no cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes for its fixed long term debt obligations 
the table below provides information about the company s risk exposure associated with changing interest rates on long term debt obligations that impact the fair value of these obligations 
long term debt in millions of dollars average average foreign average expected interest variable interest currency interest maturity fixed rate rate rate rate denominated rate thereafter  total    fair value  december     the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk primarily due to embratel s holding of approximately million in us dollar denominated debt  and approximately million of indebtedness indexed in other foreign currencies which includes french franc  deutsche mark and japanese yen 
the potential immediate loss to the company that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on this position would be approximately million after elimination of minority interests 
in addition  if such change were to be sustained  the company s cost of financing would increase in proportion to the change 
during january  the brazilian government allowed its currency to trade freely against other currencies resulting in an immediate devaluation of the brazilian real 
during the first quarter of  the brazilian real devalued against the us dollar by as much as 
if this devaluation is sustained  or worsens  the net impact to the company s results of operations could be significant 
the company is also subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its international operations which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
additionally  the company has designated the remaining billion note payable in local currency installments  resulting from the embratel investment  as a hedge of its investment in embratel 
as of december   the company recorded the change in value of the note as a reduction to the note payable with the offset through foreign currency translation adjustment in shareholders investment 
at december   marketable equity securities of the company were recorded at a fair value of billion 
the fair value of marketable equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
the marketable equity securities held by the company have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices  and would amount to a decrease in the recorded value of marketable equity securities of approximately million
