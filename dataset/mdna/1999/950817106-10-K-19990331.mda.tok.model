item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion or per share  up 
billion or per share for the year 
this increase was due principally to appreciation in market value of investments  which under accounting convention is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded using current market quotations  which are subject to fluctuation  the net gains ultimately realized could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation  which constituted of shareholders equity at december   compared to at december  over of the wesco group s unrealized appreciation of securities at december  was concentrated in three common stocks see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
however  as demonstrated in the section on market risk beginning on page  even if all appreciation of the wesco group is ignored  there has been a steady increase in shareholders equity over the past five years 
wesco s management believes the group has adequate liquidity and capital resources  including the ability to borrow  to minimize the impact of a downturn in its fortunes 
borrowings from banks and others have been available to wesco and its subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years 
in recognition of the sound financial condition of wesco and of its wes fic insurance subsidiary  wesco s million of notes due november  and wes fic s claims paying ability have since been assigned standard poor corporation s highest rating  aaa 
results of operations the following summary sets forth the contribution to wesco s consolidated net income of each business segment  insurance and industrial  as well as nonsegment activities

attention is directed to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance segment the normal net operating income of the insurance segment ie  wes fic and  since july  kbs represents essentially the combination of underwriting results with dividend and interest income 
following is a summary of such data in thousands year ended december  premiums written    premiums earned    underwriting gain    dividend and interest income    general and administrative expenses income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    premiums written by wesco s insurance subsidiaries for were comprised of million attributable to kbs and million attributable to wes fic 
premiums written in consisted of million attributable to kbs and million attributable to wes fic 
the increase in premiums written by kbs for was due principally to kbs s restructuring of its reinsurance program effective january   as explained in item  business 
as a result of the restructuring  kbs received and credited to premiums written in million of unearned reinsurance premiums that had been deducted from premiums written in prior years 
premiums written by wes fic for and included approximately million in each year relating to wes fic s participation with the berkshire insurance group in a large excess of loss super catastrophe reinsurance policy covering hurricane risk in florida under an agreement for a three year period that began january  super catastrophe reinsurance retrocessions from the berkshire insurance group to wes fic have declined substantially since inception of such arrangements in berkshire s management has attributed the decline to increased competition  it has stated repeatedly that it will not knowingly write business at inadequate rates 
earned premiums for  and included million  million and million attributable to kbs 
the remainder in each year was attributable to wes fic and related principally to super catastrophe reinsurance participations 
the underwriting gain for included million attributable to kbs and million attributable to wes fic  the latter included  notably  million attributable to a super catastrophe reinsurance policy  and a million downward revision of estimated liabilities for losses and loss expenses with respect to wes fic s quota share reinsurance of fireman s fund business 
the underwriting gain for included million attributable to kbs  and million attributable to wes fic  the latter included  notably  million attributable to two super catastrophe reinsurance policies  and a million downward revision of estimated liabilities relating to fireman s fund 
the underwriting gain for included million from kbs as well as million from wes fic on expiration of several super catastrophe reinsurance policies written in kbs s underwriting gain is net of amortization of goodwill  this excess of wes fic s cost over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired in mid about million is being written off over years or 
million per calendar year 
although no super catastrophe reinsurance losses have been incurred to date  the managements of berkshire  wes fic and wesco believe that large super catastrophe reinsurance losses will inevitably occur from time to time 
while such large losses are not expected to be significant in relation to wes fic s capital base  the managements accept the prospect of increased volatility in wes fic s short term underwriting results in order to obtain what they believe will be better long term results 
one area of particular concern to the insurance industry is its exposure to claims for environmental contamination 
wes fic s management has reported that it believes wes fic has virtually no such liability 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on the assets approximately 
billion at market value added to wes fic by the merger of mutual savings in  on capital contributed by wesco  on earnings retained and reinvested  and on float 
the income tax provision of the insurance segment has fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income in each of the periods presented in the foregoing table 
these fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are based in large part upon estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for future periods 
however  wesco s insurance subsidiaries have maintained capital positions strong enough not only to absorb adverse estimation corrections but also to enable them to accept other insurance contracts 
although additional reinsurance retrocessions from berkshire subsidiaries  or acquisitions of insurance businesses like or unlike that of kbs  or other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  would be welcome  the timing and extent of any increase in insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted 
industrial segment following is a summary of the normal net operating results of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries in thousands year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services    income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    revenues of precision steel s businesses declined in after having improved in the decline in revenue for occurred despite a increase in pounds of steel products sold  and was attributed by precision steel s management to a combination of factors  including a shift in mix of products sold toward lower priced products  and a decline in selling prices of higher margin items following price decreases by mills and other suppliers 
the improvement in revenues in resulted from a increase in pounds of steel products sold  which precision steel s management attributed principally to improvement in the industrial sector of the economy 
revenues per pound  however  decreased in following price decreases by mills and other suppliers 
income before income taxes and normal net operating income of the industrial segment are dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating expenses and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
precision steel s costs for also included 
million  before income taxes 
million after taxes  for the upgrading of computer systems to ensure that its order taking and other data processing systems would continue to function properly beyond december  see further discussion of such so called year exposure on page other than identified business segments set forth below is a summary of normal net operating income for items not identified with either business segment  insurance or industrial in thousands year ended december  dividend and interest income    rental income  net  from commercial real estate  interest expense    general and administrative expenses    reduction in allowance for losses on foreclosed real estate and other assets  other items  net income loss before income tax benefit  income tax benefit  normal net operating income loss  normal net operating income or loss other than from identified business segments includes mainly dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries and net rental income from owned commercial real estate  reduced by interest and other corporate expenses and costs and expenses associated with the development and liquidation of foreclosed real estate formerly owned by mutual savings  including adjustments of reserves for possible losses on sales of foreclosed real estate plus or minus income taxes related to such normal nonsegment items 
normal net operating income or loss other than from identified business segments typically fluctuates from period to period but is not significant in amount 
the figure benefited to the extent of million  after tax effect  from the inclusion of a reduction in reserves for possible losses on disposition of foreclosed real estate and other assets inherited from mutual savings  there were no adjustments of these reserves in or ms property has had success in selling various foreclosed properties at prices higher than were anticipated when the real estate market was extremely depressed 
nonsegment dividend and interest income declined sharply in and due to conversions of preferred stocks into lower yielding common stocks 
nonsegment interest expense declined to a lesser extent in  wesco s parent company borrowings from an insurance subsidiary were reduced  benefited from further reductions in such borrowings as well as prepayment late in of the million remaining balance of notes payable collateralized by ms property s commercial real estate 
wesco s nonsegment tax benefits appear at first glance to be anomalous compared to pre tax income or loss 
this is caused by the inclusion in pre tax income or loss of large but declining amounts of dividend income  which is highly tax favored 
all other revenues and expense items are fully taxable or deductible 
management s long term goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share  with little regard to earnings recorded in any given year 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments or the realization of securities gains 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire for funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
realized gains and losses on investments reflected on the consolidated statement of income when securities are sold  or when required by other events tend to fluctuate in amount from period to period  sometimes impacting net income significantly 
however  the amount of realized gain or loss for any given period has no predictive value  and variations in amount from period to period have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the substantial unrealized price appreciation now existing in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio 
wesco s shareholders equity at december  contained billion  or per share  of unrealized appreciation of investments  net of taxes about of shareholders equity 
wesco s consolidated earnings for contained securities gains  after income taxes  of million  compared to million of after tax gains for and after tax losses of 
million for of the figure  only 
million was realized through the sale of securities  the balance  million  was required to be treated as realized as a result of the travelers group inc s acquisition of salomon inc in  wesco was required to take a charge of million  before taxes million  after taxes on an investment that had suffered an other than temporary decline in value  eventually  the investee s fortunes recovered  and the investment was sold by wesco at a gain in the large gains reported for and  although material in relation to wesco s net income  had only a minor impact on wesco s total shareholders equity wesco s investments are carried at market value  and most of the gains had already been reflected in the unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity 
wesco s effective consolidated income tax rate typically fluctuates from period to period for various reasons  such as the inclusion in consolidated revenues of significant  varying amounts of dividend income from preferred and common stocks  which is substantially exempt from income taxes 
the respective provisions  expressed as percentages of income before income taxes  amounted to  and in  and see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses and the possible occurrence of other unusual nonoperating items 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income from operations are expected to be much more volatile than they were prior to wes fic s entry into the super catastrophe reinsurance business several years ago and  to a lesser degree  the recent restructuring of kbs s reinsurance program 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent that unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its insurance and industrial segments have potential exposure 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are often established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  and thus its earnings are susceptible to bad effects from inflationary cost increases 
market risk analysis wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained billion of marketable securities stated at market value 
the carrying values of these securities are not only directly exposed to fluctuations in their stock market prices see below  they are also indirectly exposed to risks related to other markets 
for example  the largest holding of the consolidated group billion as of december  was in common stock of freddie mac  whose principal assets are mortgages and mortgage securities  which are subject to interest rate risk 
the second and third largest holdings 
billion  combined  at december  were in common stocks of the coca cola company and the gillette company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks such as commodity price fluctuations  where material  are required to be reported upon in their filings with the securities and exchange commission  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration  as noted above 
most equity investments are expected to be held for very long periods of time  thus  wesco management is not necessarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or  in the absence of such  management s estimates of fair value 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amounts realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the table below shows the effects as of december  of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of securities defined for this purpose as marketable equity securities  plus preferred shares convertible into common stock selling significantly above conversion price owned by the wesco group 
these changes result in a pro forma increase or decrease in shareholders equity amounts in thousands increase decrease market value of securities as recorded   hypothetical assuming change   shareholders equity as recorded   pro forma results in change   the foregoing hypothetical changes in market values do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the concentration existing in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio 
however  wesco has substantial shareholders equity  providing a margin of safety against a significant decline in portfolio values 
this can be seen by glancing at the following balance sheet totals  which result from removing all unrealized appreciation and related deferred taxes from balance sheet totals shown in the final table in item in thousands except for amounts per share december  total assets      total liabilities      total shareholders equity      per capital share wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to interest rate  commodity price  or foreign exchange rate risks 
the wesco group does not utilize stand alone derivatives to manage these or other market risks 
year exposure many computer systems used today were not designed to interpret data correctly after december  because only two digits were used to indicate the year in a date 
other systems and equipment were designed with similar limitations  often due to the circuitry of computer chips embedded therein 
wesco and its subsidiaries have been engaged in assessing these potential year problems as they relate to their businesses  including their electronic and other interactions with banks  vendors  customers and others  and developing and implementing solutions 
in addition  wesco has been attempting to satisfy itself that non subsidiary companies in which it has material investments are proceeding in like manner 
wesco and affiliated companies have been working on year readiness issues in varying degrees for several years 
managements of the operating units have reported that the process of identifying year problems and determining remedial action is nearly complete 
it appears all critical systems will be year compliant by the summer of testing of systems believed to be year compliant has begun and will continue throughout a number of customers and suppliers  including banks and providers of payroll services  have been contacted regarding their own progress on year issues 
while no significant customer or supplier has expressed doubt that it will resolve its year issues in a timely manner  wesco can provide no assurance that significant year noncompliance by one or more unrelated parties will not ultimately occur  resulting in the inability of a wesco operating unit to obtain or deliver products or services  or the incurrence by a wesco insurance subsidiary of losses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts 
while such noncompliance by an unrelated party could conceivably have a materially adverse effect on wesco s consolidated net income  wesco s management does not believe that the total worst case effect  which cannot be estimated  would be material in relation to its shareholders equity 
insofar as non subsidiary investees are concerned  wesco s assessment of its year exposure has been limited to review of sec mandated disclosures in published reports  augmented by contact with representatives of freddie mac  which accounts for well over half of the market value of consolidated marketable equity securities 
in each case the outside entity has indicated it is aware of the year issue and is in process of assessing the situation and developing and implementing solutions in a timely manner 
wesco will continue to monitor its investees progress  because if one or more of them were not adequately prepared at the start of  or if capital markets were severely disrupted due to the failure of governmental bodies or private entities to address year issues in a timely and effective manner  wesco could suffer material adverse effects 
although the financial impact of such effects cannot be estimated  in the extremely unlikely event the overall market value of wesco s investments dropped to original cost  in the opinion of wesco s management  wesco and its operating units would still be clearly viable 
wesco expects ultimately to incur approximately 
million in identification  remediation and testing of year issues 
approximately 
million of this amount 
million after income taxes had been incurred and charged against earnings as of december  wesco does not believe that any significant information technology projects have been delayed due to year efforts 
wesco and its subsidiaries have begun consideration of contingency plans to deal with certain year issues in the event that remediation efforts by themselves or others prove unsuccessful 
such plans will be more fully developed throughout to address specific areas of need
