third parties manufacture all of our motorsports collectibles and most of our apparel and souvenirs  generally utilizing our designs  tools  and dies 
we screen print and embroider a portion of the licensed motorsports apparel that we sell 
our company was incorporated in arizona in may and we began marketing die cast collectibles in july in august  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of fan fueler  inc and began marketing licensed motorsports consumer products 
during fiscal and and the first two quarters of fiscal  we designed and marketed pedal  electric  and gas powered mini vehicles  primarily as specialty promotional items 
we sold the assets related to our mini vehicle operations in march in november  we acquired sports image and in january we acquired motorsport traditions  both of which marketed and distributed licensed motorsports apparel  die cast collectibles  and other souvenir items 
in july  we acquired ryp  which had operations similar to those of sports image and motorsport traditions 
in july  we also acquired image works  which manufactures and markets licensed motorsports apparel through the mass merchandising markets 
we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities related to the mini helmet collectible business of simpson in august following these acquisitions  we took a number of actions intended to integrate the operations of the acquired companies with our existing operations and to reduce overall selling  general  and administrative expenses associated with the acquired entities 
these efforts had a meaningful impact on our results of operations beginning in the second half of fiscal in december  we completed an acquisition in which we acquired assets related to sales of motorsports merchandise licensed by nascar driver rusty wallace 
in december  we also acquired the assets related to certain revell trademarked die cast products 
our company and revell also entered into a year license agreement and a long term strategic alliance involving extensive marketing and distribution arrangements 
in january  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of brookfield  which distributes various motorsports collectibles and other die cast replicas 
in may  we acquired a majority interest in chase  which licenses apparel and clothing accessories that bear chase branded marks

in september  we acquired a majority interest in performance plus  which develops and markets driver endorsed nutritional products  including vitamins  energy bars  and energy drinks 
in october  we acquired ipg  which expanded our resources and ability to develop promotional programs for corporate sponsors of motorsports 
in november  we acquired tech  which operates the goracing 
com network 
in january  we acquired goodsports  which markets and distributes licensed formula one apparel and related products 
during fiscal  we significantly expanded our emphasis on developing the internet as an important distribution channel for our products 
in february  we launched our e commerce web sites dedicated to sales of our products  as well as speedmall  which includes web sites that sell motorsports and automotive related products offered by other companies 
in october  we acquired fantasy sports enterprises  which develops and operates fantasy auto racing and other sports related games via the internet and by traditional means 
we believe that the acquisitions described above provide us with enhanced revenue opportunities as a result of the synergies created by expanded product offerings and additional distribution channels 
for example  in fiscal we began developing new lines of licensed motorsports apparel and souvenirs for exclusive sales through our collectors club 
these acquisitions also provide opportunities for additional sales growth of our die cast  apparel  and other products through trackside sales  corporate promotional programs  our e commerce web sites and fan clubs 
prior to the fiscal and acquisitions  our revenue consisted primarily of sales of die cast collectibles 
the revenue of the businesses acquired during fiscal and consisted primarily of sales of either die cast or other collectibles or licensed motorsports apparel and souvenirs 
as a result of these acquisitions and our subsequent efforts to develop new product lines and distribution channels  sales of collectible products represented approximately of net sales in fiscal and sales of apparel and souvenirs represented approximately of net sales in fiscal in fiscal and  other revenue consisted primarily of sales from the mini vehicle operations that we sold in fiscal beginning in fiscal  other revenue consists of royalty income derived from apparel licensing activities by chase and our license agreement with hasbro  as well as revenue from internet advertising and web site development 
our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products procured from third party manufacturers  royalty payments to licensors  and depreciation of tooling and dies 
significant factors affecting our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales include the overall percentage of net sales represented by sales of die cast collectible products  which typically carry higher gross margins than our other products  the percentage of sales of die cast collectible products represented by sales through the collectors club  which typically carry higher gross margins than sales of such products through wholesale distributors  the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily depreciation of tooling and dies  over varying levels of net sales  and fluctuations in royalty rates associated with corporate promotional programs 
increased sales of licensed apparel and souvenirs following the fiscal acquisitions resulted in lower overall gross margins during fiscal and as a result of lower gross margins generally associated with the acquired product lines 
sales of collectible products as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as a result of the successful completion of several large scale corporate promotional programs 
as a result  gross margins improved slightly in fiscal as compared with fiscal and selling  general  and administrative expenses include general corporate expenses 
we anticipate that our ongoing efforts to consolidate our operations and reduce operating costs will enable us to lower selling  general  and administrative expenses related to our core business operations 
we anticipate that expenses related to our internet operations  however  will offset any savings we achieve in other areas 
we recorded goodwill and other intangibles of approximately million in connection with the fiscal acquisitions  million from the acquisitions completed in fiscal  and approximately million from the acquisitions completed in fiscal we are amortizing the goodwill and other intangibles over three to years 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain expense and revenue items

fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september net sales increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  we attribute the improvement in sales during fiscal primarily to our ability to capitalize on the continued strong growth in the base of motorsports enthusiasts and to produce and sell increased quantities of souvenirs  apparel  and die cast collectible goods  additional revenue from promotional programs for die cast  apparel  and souvenirs  expanded sales through our retail trackside operations and mass retail channels  a full year s revenue from our international operations  and an increase in collectors club membership 
the number of members in the collectors club increased to approximately  members at september  from approximately  members at september  gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from a greater economies of scale as a result of the larger production runs associated with the corporate promotional programs conducted during fiscal  which decreased costs of sales as a percentage of sales for those products  and b an increase in sales  as a percentage of total sales  of die cast products  which typically provide higher gross margins than our other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from a development and other operating costs related to the launch of our internet operations in fiscal  b increased depreciation expenses of approximately million associated with capitalized costs added in fiscal  and c increased expenses for facilities and personnel  particularly in our charlotte operations 
settlement costs of million for the year ended september  resulted from a one time charge for the settlement of a lawsuit and related legal charges 
this settlement represented of net sales in fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is related to an approximately  expense recorded in connection with the acquisitions of tech and goodsports during fiscal  and an additional million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our fiscal acquisitions  which were expensed over the entire year in fiscal we amortize the goodwill and other intangible assets over periods of three to years 
interest income expense and other  net  changed to a net expense of approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal the change was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately million related to the convertible subordinated notes 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september net sales increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  we attribute the improvement in sales during fiscal primarily to revenue from our fiscal and acquisitions  our ability to capitalize on the continued strong growth in the base of motorsports enthusiasts and to produce and sell increased quantities of souvenirs  apparel  and die cast collectible goods  and an increase in membership in the collectors club to approximately  members at september  from approximately  members at september  gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from increased sales of die cast collectibles through wholesale channels  which typically provide lower margins than sales of such products through the collectors club 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from cost savings achieved with the integration and consolidation of operations of the businesses acquired in fiscal and the integration and consolidation included the relocation of motorsport traditions into sports image s facility  the integration of management information systems  and a reduction in excess labor 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is related to the acquisitions of sports image  motorsport traditions  and other entities 
we recorded goodwill and other intangibles of million in connection with the fiscal acquisitions  and recorded an additional million of goodwill and other intangibles from the acquisitions completed in fiscal we are amortizing the goodwill and other intangibles over periods of three to years 
interest income expense and other  net  changed to a net expense of approximately million for fiscal from a net expense of approximately million for fiscal the change was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately million related to the issuance of million of subordinated notes in march  offset by an increase in interest income of approximately million related to proceeds from our common stock offering in june and the sale of the subordinated notes in march pro forma results of operations the following table sets forth the unaudited pro forma income statement data of our company for the fiscal years ended september  and  giving effect to a the acquisitions of the rusty wallace acquisition  the revell acquisition  and the acquisitions of brookfield  chase  minichamps  performance plus  ipg  tech  and goodsports as if they had occurred on october   using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  except for ipg  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and b the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes due  which are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of common stock 
the conversion of the notes had an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share for fiscal year and therefore are not assumed converted during that period 
the unaudited pro forma income statement data presented below does not purport to represent what our actual results of operations would have been had those acquisitions occurred on october  or to project our results of operations for any future period 
fiscal year ended september  september  in thousands  except per share data net sales   net income   interest  net of tax  on convertible subordinated notes payable  net income attributable to diluted shares outstanding   net income per common share  assuming dilution pro forma amounts for fiscal include the one time charge of approximately  or per share  for legal settlement costs and related charges 
pro forma amounts for fiscal include the one time charge of approximately million  or per share  for legal settlement costs and related charges 
the pro forma results shown above do not account for efficiencies gained upon the consolidation of operations  including the elimination of duplicative functions and reduction of salary expense and other related costs 
the pro forma results of operations for the years ended september  and reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles arising from the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions and include additional interest expense associated with any financing of the acquisitions 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the eight quarters in the fiscal years ended september  and all quarterly information was obtained from unaudited financial statements not otherwise contained in this report 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been made to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

we had previously accounted for the tech acquisition as a pooling of interests 
we subsequently determined that the transaction should be accounted for as a purchase 
the effect of reflecting the tech acquisition as a purchase rather than a pooling is immaterial to our quarterly and year end operating results 
our revenue and operating results may be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors 
as a result of the fiscal and acquisitions  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our past financial results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
seasonality because the auto racing season is concentrated between the months of february and november  the second and third calendar quarters of each year our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally are characterized by higher sales of motorsports products 
our limited internet operating history and the new and rapidly evolving internet markets make it difficult to predict the effects of seasonality on our business in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital position increased to million at september  from million at september  the increase of million is primarily attributable to increased inventories and accounts receivables and decreased accounts payable through results of operations 
capital expenditures for the year ended september  totaled approximately million  of which we utilized approximately million for our continued investment in tooling 
during the year ended september   we issued  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options  resulting in total proceeds to us of approximately million 
on march   we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due the subordinated notes are convertible  at the option of the holders  into shares of common stock at the initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments in certain events

upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading  as defined in the indenture  the holders of the subordinated notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest

our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility 
the line of credit contains provisions that require us to comply with certain financial covenants and that limit our ability to incur additional debt or make certain investments  to sell assets  to engage in certain mergers or consolidations  or to pay dividends

the senior notes bore interest at the rate of per annum  and matured in january we used available cash resources  including the proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes  to repay the senior notes at maturity

ltd  an australian based marketer of formula one related apparel and other merchandise

com network 
we contributed the operations of the collectors club to goracing along with the other internet operations because of the increasing migration of club members to use of the internet to order our products and the importance of providing seamless order fulfillment services to them 
on july   goracing 
com  inc 
filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering of its class a common stock 
in december  we announced that we would indefinitely postpone the goracing public offering 
we will record non recurring charges of up to million in the first quarter of fiscal for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed offering  as well as various management restructuring charges that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal in august  goracing entered into an agreement with a financial institution under which goracing has available up to million for the purposes of acquiring capital equipment under operating leases 
as of september   goracing had executed operating leases totaling approximately million under this agreement 
we have guaranteed goracing s obligations under this agreement 
in december  our board of directors approved a program in which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the initial term of the repurchase program will be one year  subject to extension by the board of directors depending on market conditions 
we are a defendant in various lawsuits  including a securities class action lawsuit filed in november see item  legal proceedings 
we have agreed to settle one lawsuit and we recorded a non recurring pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect the financial terms of the proposed settlement  as well as legal and other expenses related to the lawsuit and proposed settlement 
the final settlement will be subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive settlement agreements  as well as court approval 
we have not made any provisions in our financial statements with respect to the securities class action lawsuit we are defending 
the imposition of any additional damages in the lawsuit we have agreed to settle or the imposition of damages in the securities class action lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
from time to time we also are subject to certain asserted and unasserted claims encountered in the normal course of business 
we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that damages that result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation will not be imposed in these matters 
we believe that our current cash resources  our credit facility with first union  goracing s commitment for capital equipment lease financing  and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital needs during the next months at our current level of operations  apart from capital needs resulting from additional acquisitions and the capital required to enable goracing to fully execute its growth strategy 
goracing will require additional capital from our capital resources or from outside sources to be able to fully execute its growth strategy 
we may be required to obtain additional capital to fund the planned growth of other aspects of our business during the next months and beyond 
potential sources of any such capital may include the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options  bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of our equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of such capital could have a material adverse effect on our business 
year compliance we are heavily dependent upon complex computer software and systems for our operations 
many existing computer programs and systems use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs and systems were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at january  state of readiness all of our material operating software and our information technology systems and other systems  including telecommunications and warehouse systems  were developed or are supported either by our internal staff or by third party vendors 
during  we engaged computer associates international  inc to commence a program to install new information technology  or it  and non it systems including hardware and software programs that are intended to integrate management information systems throughout our organizational structure  as well as to comply with year requirements 
as of the date of this report  the installation is complete and operational with respect to those systems that we believe were not year compliant 
we believe that our new software systems will comply with the year requirements  and we do not anticipate any material disruption to our operations as a result of any failure of any of our systems to function properly beyond december  we are coordinating the delivery  receipt  and summary of results of year surveys sent for the purpose of determining year readiness of our significant vendors and suppliers 
we have determined that there are significant vendors and suppliers 
of the surveys sent to significant vendors and suppliers  have provided written affirmation that they are year compliant 
another have indicated  through written response  that their compliance programs are ongoing 
these vendors and suppliers have indicated that their compliance programs will be complete by the end of the fourth quarter of we continue to monitor the status of all our significant vendors and suppliers to minimize the risk of any material adverse effect on our operations that may result from year failures of any of our significant vendors or suppliers 
we cannot assure you  however  that our vendors or service providers have or will have operating software and systems that are year compliant 
risks the failure of our software or systems to be year compliant could prevent us from being able to process or fulfill orders from our customers  could cause users of our web sites to consider alternative web community and content providers  or could disrupt our financial and management controls and reporting systems 
we believe the most reasonably likely worst case scenario resulting from a year problem affecting our systems would be a short term inability to process orders  billings  payables  and payroll in a timely manner  as we would have to resort to alternative manual procedures 
however  in view of our year readiness efforts to date  we believe significant disruptions within our systems are unlikely 
another worst case scenario could arise because our customers make a significant portion of purchases of merchandise from us with credit cards 
our operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent our customers are unable to use their credit cards due to year issues that are not rectified by the end of calendar year third parties in asia manufacture a significant portion of our products 
because the manufacturing processes utilized generally do not rely upon date related information  we currently believe that a failure on the part of our overseas manufacturers to bring their processes and equipment into year compliance does not represent a material risk to our ability to obtain products on a timely basis 
our overseas manufacturers may be at risk with respect to suppliers of necessary resources  particularly suppliers of power  water  and telecommunications  if those suppliers are not year compliant 
extended disruptions in the operations of our overseas manufacturers or companies that ship our products would materially and adversely impact our ability to obtain our products on a timely basis 
to date  we have not identified any significant exposure to year problems outside of the information technology issues identified above 
we have developed contingency plans to address service interruptions and other failures that may occur as a result of year issues 
these contingency plans include the development of manually operated alternative procedures  identification of alternative vendors  development of emergency backup and recovery procedures for lost data  and development of plans as a result of our assessment of customer year issues  as noted above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
we do not currently use and we have not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
at september   we had million outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes at an interest rate of  and approximately million of debt outstanding at various rates and terms  principally under promissory notes and capital leases 
interest rates on these credit instruments are fixed and comparable to current market rates 
the functional currency for our foreign operations is the deutschmark and british pound sterling 
as such  changes in exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar could adversely affect our future earnings 
given the level of income we currently derive from our foreign operations  we consider this exposure to be minimal 
a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on our future earnings
