item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the section entitled business risk factors 
general the company derives revenue principally from the sale of integrated circuits for use in communications and video and imaging product areas 
the company s gross margins from sales of integrated circuits vary depending on competition from other manufacturers  the volume of products manufactured and sold  the company s ability to achieve certain manufacturing efficiencies and the cost of material procured from the company s suppliers 
the company s newer analog and mixed signal products tend to have higher gross margins than many of the company s more mature products and margins of any particular product may erode over time 
the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in japan  taiwan  and europe to support its sales operations in each of those areas 
the company s business in japan includes the sale of integrated circuits primarily for use in consumer electronics 
the company has made a number of changes in its underlying business over the past several years in an effort to reduce its low margin businesses and focus its product strategy 
at the same time  to increase its share of revenues from the sale of proprietary products and to acquire additional technology  the company made significant investments through direct acquisition of companies with related product lines 
restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan to i reduce manufacturing expenses by transferring its test and shipping operations to offshore subcontractors  ii focus the company s product strategy to provide analog and mixed signal products for the video  imaging  communications and silicon sensor markets and iii narrow the company s distribution channels to create more leverage 
the company s restructuring actions consisted primarily of writing down certain equipment as a result of the transfer of operations and change in product focus  terminating full time employees  writing down inventory associated with product lines which are being discontinued  canceling certain facility leases and cancellation of contracts as a result of a change in distribution channels  and writing down goodwill associated with discontinued products 
these actions resulted in a charge of million to operating expenses and million to cost of goods sold 
the charges include a non cash charge of  and cash expenditures of  as of march  an accrual of approximately  remains related to cancellation of lease obligations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its silicon microstructures business unit to osi systems  inc osi for million  with additional contingent performance based payments of up to million over the next two years 
the resulting restructuring charge of  represents the loss on the sale of the assets sold  severance costs related to the termination of employees and other disposition related expenses 
the restructuring action was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal and was financed through the use of cash 
in october  the company entered into a wafer production agreement with ic works  inc ic works 
under the terms of the agreement  exar invested approximately million for the purchase and installation of equipment at ic works  in exchange for a predetermined supply of wafers over the next five years 
under separate but related agreements  exar has made a minority equity investment in ic works of approximately million 
the dramatically changed market conditions for wafer pricing and availability  as well as the recent business redirection of exar  have led to a reassessment of exar s foundry relationships and process requirements 
these factors combined with delays in the commencement of anticipated production by the foundry  resulted in the termination of the wafer production agreement 
the company incurred a fourth quarter fiscal charge to operating expenses of million as a result of negotiations to terminate the company s wafer production agreement with ic works 
during the quarter ended december   the company sold the capital assets written down in connection with this prior year charge 
the sales proceeds exceeded the carrying value and  as a result  the company reversed million of the related reserve during the quarter 
offsetting this reversal  the company decided during the quarter to replace its current information system under development with a system determined to better meet the company s needs and wrote off million of capitalized costs associated with system modules which the company does not intend to use 
as a result of a merger completed on april  of ic works  inc and cypress semiconductor  the company received in excess of million shares of cypress semiconductor cy nyse common stock in exchange for the company s minority equity investment in ic works  inc the company anticipates a pre tax gain of approximately million and this transaction will be accounted for in the company s fiscal year ended march  results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship to net sales of certain cost  expense and income items 
the table and subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended march  net sales cost of sales cost of sales inventory write off research and development selling  general and administrative write off of in process r d and other charges goodwill amortization 
operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss fiscal vs fiscal net sales during fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
these decreases were primarily due to decreases in net sales of discontinued consumer and custom products in the company s legacy product lines  as well as the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines 
the abrupt closure of one of the company s third party fab suppliers during the third quarter of fiscal had a further negative impact of approximately million on the company s fiscal revenue from legacy products 
this closure is expected to result in a further decline in revenue from legacy products of approximately million per quarter through fiscal in fiscal  sales to domestic customers decreased by to million 
international sales decreased by to approximately million 
the company s international sales consist of sales from the united states to overseas customers and sales by the company s wholly owned subsidiary in japan 
sales by the company s japanese subsidiary are denominated in yen  while all other international sales are denominated in us dollars 
the fact that the company operates internationally gives rise to exposures from changes in currency exchange rates 
the company has adopted a set of practices intended to minimize its foreign currency risk which includes the use  from time to time  of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge amounts receivable from its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  foreign sales may be subject to tariffs in certain countries or with regard to certain products  however  the company s profit margin on international sales of integrated circuits  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on its sales to domestic customers 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the resulting increase in gross margins is due primarily to a greater mix of the company s newer analog and mixed signal products which tend to have higher gross margins than many of the company s more mature products 
the company s gross margins from sales of integrated circuits vary depending on competition from other manufacturers  the volume of products manufactured and sold  the company s ability to achieve certain manufacturing efficiencies and the cost of material procured from the company s suppliers 
margins of any particular product may erode over time 
expenditures for research and development  as a percentage of net sales  increased from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal expenditures for research and development decreased approximately million or compared to fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable to the company s control of operating expenses in response to decreased revenues  lower employee benefits costs and to the restructuring activities associated with the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from approximately in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by million or compared to fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to decreased commissions expense  lower employee benefits costs and to the company s control of operating expenses in response to decreased revenues 
net interest income during fiscal increased to million from the million reported in fiscal due to increased balances of cash and short term investments in fiscal the company s provision for income taxes is based on income from operations 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately compared with the federal statutory rate of 
the discrepancy is due to non deductible expenses  state income taxes and foreign losses  which is taxed at rates different from us income tax rates  partially offset by tax advantaged investment income and tax savings generated from utilization of the company s foreign sales corporation 
net income for the fiscal year was million  or per diluted share  a decrease from net income for the fiscal year of million  or 
per diluted share 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results 
fiscal vs fiscal net sales during fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
this increase was primarily due to significant increases in net sales in the company s communications and silicon microstructure product lines as well as last time buy activity pertaining to some of the company s discontinued custom legacy products 
these increases were partially offset by a significant decrease in net sales of discontinued consumer products 
in fiscal  sales to domestic us customers increased by to million 
international sales  increased by to approximately million 
the company s international sales consist of sales from the united states to overseas customers and sales by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries in japan 
sales by the company s japanese subsidiary are denominated in yen  while all other international sales are denominated in us dollars

in addition  foreign sales may be subject to tariffs in certain countries or with regard to certain products  however  the company s profit margin on international sales of integrated circuits  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on its sales to domestic customers 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal excluding the one time inventory write off to in fiscal the resulting increase in gross margins is due primarily to manufacturing efficiencies due to higher production volumes  changes in product mix and efficiencies gained as a result of the company s decision  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  to transfer its test and shipping operations to offshore sub contractors to reduce manufacturing expenses 
expenditures for research and development increased approximately million or compared to fiscal due primarily to increased spending on mask sets and other related costs for new product development 
expenditures for research and development  as a percentage of net sales  increased from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million or compared to fiscal due primarily to increased spending on marketing efforts 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of sales is due primarily to the increase in net sales 
the company incurred million in compensation expenses during fiscal and million in fiscal for the final payment related to the acquisition of startech  semiconductor  inc in fiscal there are no further deferred compensation obligations under this arrangement 
net interest income during fiscal increased to million from the million reported in fiscal due to increased balances of cash and short term investments in fiscal the company s provision for income taxes is based on income from operations

in addition  the company has refocused its product strategy to provide analog and mixed signal products for the video  imaging and communications applications and  therefore  has discontinued certain product offerings 
furthermore  the semiconductor industry is characterized by economic downturns resulting in diminished product demand  erosion of average selling prices  intense competition  rapid technological change  occasional shortages of materials  dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel and significant expenditures for product development 
in addition  the cyclical market patterns of the semiconductor industry periodically result in shortages of wafer fabrication capacity 
the company s availability to meet future demand for its products is dependent upon obtaining sufficient supply of raw materials and components 
the company s operations have reflected  and may in the future reflect  substantial fluctuation from period to period as a result of the above factors  as well as general economic conditions  the timing of orders from major customers  variations in manufacturing efficiencies  exchange rate fluctuations  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  management decisions to commence or discontinue certain product lines  the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis and other factors 
exar s future operating results could continue to be adversely affected by a downturn in the semiconductor market  the asian financial crisis or by the failure of one or more of its customers to compete successfully in their markets 
the markets for components used in video  imaging and communications products are extremely price competitive 
liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal years ended march   and  the company financed its operations primarily from cash flows from operations and existing cash and short term investments 
at march   the company had million in cash and short term investments 
the company has available a short term  unsecured  bank line of credit under which it may borrow up to  none of which was being utilized at march  in addition  the company has a credit facility with certain domestic and foreign banks under which it may execute up to  in foreign currency transactions 
at march   the company had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
the company made a million minority equity investment in ic works  inc  a semiconductor manufacturer ic works  in february in april  the company made an additional equity investment in ic works of million 
as a result of a merger completed on april  of ic works  inc and cypress semiconductor  the company received in excess of million shares of cypress semiconductor cy nyse common stock in exchange for the company s minority equity investment in ic works  inc the company anticipates a pre tax gain of approximately million and this transaction will be accounted for in the company s fiscal year ended march  the company anticipates that it will finance its operations with cash flows from operations  existing cash and a short term investment balances  borrowings under existing bank credit lines  and some combination of long term debt and or lease financing and additional sales of equity securities 
the combination and sources of capital will be determined by management based on the needs of the company and prevailing market conditions 
year and proximate dates many computer systems are expected to experience problems interpreting dates around the year following is a summary of our activities to address the ability of our business to operate around these dates state of readiness and contingency plans the company has completed the process of identifying the programs and infrastructure in all areas of the company including manufacturing  engineering and facilities that could be affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
in  in order to improve access to business information through common  integrated computing systems across the company  the company began a worldwide business systems replacement project with systems that use programs primarily from oracle corporation oracle 
the new systems implementation  which is expected to make the company s core business computer systems are year compliant  was substantially completed in the quarter ending march  a plan has been developed to make any remaining legacy computer systems are year compliant 
these remaining legacy systems include  pc based computer applications  stock option tracking software  and time and attendance hardware and software 
the plan for replacing these remaining legacy systems is approximately complete and on schedule for completion in the quarter ended september  in the event that the company is unable to successfully complete the replacement of these legacy systems  the company believes that a contingency plan using manual reporting and tracking systems can easily be implemented without a disruption in the company s critical business functions 
costs the cost of the oracle implementation was approximately million dollars and the replacement of the remaining legacy systems is estimated to cost 
million 
approximately million dollars will be capitalized and is for the development of the oracle related software and hardware  and the replacement of the remaining legacy systems 
the company has expensed approximately 
million of project costs in prior periods 
the oracle implementation was substantially complete as of march  and the capitalized portion will be depreciated over an average of six years commencing in fy risks the company believes that with the implementation of the above mentioned hardware and software  it will be able to operate its time sensitive business application software programs and infrastructure into and beyond the year however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
furthermore  the company is in the process of working with certain key suppliers and customers to assess their year readiness 
the failure by a third party to adequately address the year issue could have a material adverse impact on such third party s ability to furnish products and services to the company and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through its operations in japan 
this exposure is the result of timing differences between incoming and outgoing cashflows denominated in foreign currency 
operational currency requirements are typically forecast for a three month period 
if there is a need to hedge this risk  the company will enter into transactions to purchase or sell currency in the open market  or enter into forward currency exchange contracts which are currently available under the company s bank lines of credit 
while it is expected that this method of hedging foreign currency risk will be utilized in the future  the hedging methodology and or usage may be changed to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
if the company s foreign operations forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  unanticipated currency gains or losses could be experienced 
at the end of fiscal years and  the company did not have significant foreign currency denominated net assets or net liabilities positions  and has no outstanding foreign currency contracts 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturity dates with various banks and investment banking institutions 
the company does not regularly hold investments with maturity dates beyond days 
the market value of these investments on any day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
this exposure is not hedged because a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on investment income 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
the short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
this designation is re evaluated as of each balance sheet date 
at march   short term investments consisted of auction rate securities of  at march   short term investments consisted of government agency securities of  and auction rate securities of  as of march  and  there were no significant differences between the fair market value and the underlying cost of such investments
