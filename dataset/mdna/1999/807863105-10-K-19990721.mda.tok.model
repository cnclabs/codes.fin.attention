our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the following potential tax liability from spin offs 
we became a public company on june  when us office products distributed all of our shares and the shares of three other companies to its shareholders and we sold additional shares of our stock in a public offering 
these distributions known as the spin offs were intended to be tax free to both us office products and its shareholders 
as part of the spin offs  we and the other three companies whose shares were distributed each agreed with us office products that if any of us took any action or failed to act in a way that materially caused the distributions to be taxable  then us office products could require any of us to pay to it the full amount of the tax losses it suffered as a result of the distributions 
we and the three other spin off companies also agreed that if the distributions became taxable for any other reason  we would each pay to us office products a portion of its tax losses based on the relative aggregate value of each company s common stock immediately after the distributions 
we estimate that our portion of any such tax losses under this agreement would be approximately 
we also agreed with the other three spin off companies that if one or more of us materially caused the distributions to be taxable and any of the other companies were required to pay tax losses under the agreement to us office products  then the company or companies that materially caused the distributions to be taxable would reimburse the other companies for such payments 
as a result of these agreements  we could be required to pay all of the tax losses of us office products if we cause the distributions to be taxable  our portion of the tax losses of us office products even if neither we nor any of the other three companies cause the distributions to be taxable  or all of the tax losses of us office products even if we did not cause the distributions to be taxable and one or more of the other companies did while such other companies would be required to reimburse us for such payment  we cannot be sure that we will receive such reimbursement 
exposure to risks related to other liabilities of us office products 
as part of the distributions  we and the other three spin off companies each agreed with us office products to pay a portion of the securities law and general liabilities of us office products arising prior to the distributions and  if any of the spin off companies fails to pay its portion  to pay a portion of the unpaid amount 
these shared liabilities do not include any liability that relates specifically to a particular spin off company or to the continuing businesses of us office products after the distributions 
the portion of the shared liabilities payable by each spin off company is based on the average of each company s revenues for fiscal relative to those of us office products and each company s operating income for fiscal relative to that of us office products 
we estimate that our portion of any such liabilities under this agreement would be approximately  but the maximum aggregate amount we can be required to pay for all shared liabilities is limited by the agreement to million including as a result of defaults by the other spin off companies 
us office products has been named as a defendant in various class action lawsuits relating to the distributions that allege  among other things  violations of the federal securities laws 
as a result of these agreements  we may be required to pay up to million to us office products for shared liabilities even though they are unrelated to our business and operations  we have no control over such liabilities and one or more of the other spin off companies may be primarily responsible for such liabilities 
limited independent operating history 
prior to the spin off in june  we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of us office products and many of our general  administrative and financial functions including legal  accounting  purchasing  management information services and borrowings were handled by us office products 
since the spin off  we have operated independently of us office products and have been independently responsible for managing and financing all aspects of our business and operations 
our expenses are likely to be higher than when we were a subsidiary of us office products and we may experience difficulties with respect to general  administrative and financial functions that we did not experience as part of us office products 
because some of the financial information included in this annual report relates to periods during which we were a subsidiary of us office products  it does not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and financial condition would have been it we were independent during those periods and it may not be a good indication of what our future results of operations and financial condition will be 
risk of rapid growth and dependence upon acquisitions for future growth 
our business has grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years 
since may  we have acquired companies 
future growth in our revenues and earnings depends substantially on our ability to continue to acquire and successfully integrate and operate school supply companies 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire businesses at all or on reasonable terms 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to operate the businesses that we acquire profitably or that our management and financial controls  personnel  computer systems and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage the increased size and scope of our operations as a result of acquisitions 
managing and integrating acquired businesses may result in substantial costs  delays or other operating or financial problems that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these include the diversion of management s attention and other resources away from our existing businesses  significant charges and expenses relating to employee severance  restructuring and transaction costs and other unexpected events or liabilities  the inability to retain  hire or train qualified personnel for the acquired businesses  and the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
we intend to pay for acquisitions in whole or in part using our shares  and in some cases this may dilute our earnings per share 
our ability and willingness to use our shares will depend upon their market price and the willingness of sellers to accept our shares 
in addition  our ability to issue shares may be limited by section e of the internal revenue code of under that section  us office products will incur tax liability for the distribution of our shares if or more  by vote or value  of the capital stock of either us office products or school specialty is acquired by one or more persons acting pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin off 
there is a presumption that any acquisition occurring within two years after the spin off is pursuant to a plan that includes the spin off 
however  the presumption may be overcome by establishing that the spin off and such acquisition are not part of a plan or series of related transactions 
as noted above  we will be liable for all the tax liabilities of us office products if our actions cause the spin off to be taxable and will be liable for all or a portion of such liabilities even if our actions did not cause the spin off to be taxable 
inability to use the pooling of interests method of accounting  material amount of goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we must be independent for at least two years before we can use the pooling of interests method of accounting for share acquisitions  which would avoid the creation and subsequent amortization of goodwill 
because we were a wholly owned subsidiary of us office products until the completion of the spin off on june   we will not be eligible to use pooling of interest accounting until june  we must use purchase accounting for any acquisitions prior to that date  which may continue to result in the creation of goodwill 
approximately million  or  of our total assets as of april  represents intangible assets  the significant majority of which is goodwill 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
we are required to record goodwill as an intangible asset on our balance sheet and to amortize it over a period of years 
we generally amortize goodwill for each acquisition on a straight line method over a period of years  which means that in each year during the year period th of the goodwill is taken off our balance sheet and recorded in our income statement as a non cash expense which reduces our net income 
even though it reduces our net income for accounting purposes  amortization of goodwill may not be deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we are required to periodically evaluate whether we can recover our remaining goodwill from the undiscounted future cash flows that we expect to receive from the operations of the acquired companies 
if these undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the associated goodwill  the goodwill is impaired and we must reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to equal the discounted future cash flows and take the amount of the reduction as a charge against our income 
reductions in our net income caused by the amortization or write down of goodwill could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on growth of student population and school expenditures 
our growth strategy and profitability also depend on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in public and private elementary and secondary schools 
the level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics  while expenditures per student are also affected by government budgets and the prevailing political and social attitudes towards education 
any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality of our business 
our educational supply businesses are highly seasonal 
because most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year in september  we make most of our sales from may to october 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first six months of our fiscal year and operate at a loss in our third fiscal quarter 
this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
dependence on key suppliers and service providers 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products  especially furniture 
we also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products 
if these suppliers or service providers are unable to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs especially during our peak season of june through september  this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were  for example  adversely affected by the united parcel service strike during august due to the perception that we were unable to ship products 
as we seek to reduce the number of our suppliers and to minimize duplicative lines as part of our business strategy  we are likely to increase our dependence on remaining vendors 
reliance on key personnel 
our business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of current executive officers and senior management  including daniel p 
spalding  our chief executive officer 
we are also likely to depend heavily on the executive officers and senior management of businesses that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people become unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present role  or if we are unable to attract and retain other qualified employees  our business could be adversely affected 
although we have employment contracts with most executive officers  we do not have employment agreements with our senior management 
we do not have and do not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of senior management 
competition 
the market for school supplies is highly competitive and fragmented 
we estimate that over  companies market educational materials to schools for pre kindergarten through twelfth grade as a primary focus of their business 
we also face increasing competition from alternate channel marketers  including superstores and office product contract stationers  that have not traditionally focused on marketing school supplies 
these competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in school supplies 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do 
we believe that the educational supplies market will consolidate over the next several years  which is likely to increase competition in our markets and in our search for attractive acquisition candidates 
dependence on our systems  our year issues 
we believe that one of our competitive advantages is our information systems  including our proprietary pc based customer order management system 
we have integrated the operations of almost all of our divisions and subsidiaries and their information systems are linked to host systems located at our headquarters in appleton  wisconsin and at two other locations 
if any of these links disrupted or become unavailable  this could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
several of our recently acquired divisions and or subsidiaries as well as gresswell our foreign subsidiary use predecessor information systems 
with the exception of gresswell  we intend to convert the information systems of these businesses to one of our host systems as soon as practicable 
however  none of these businesses has a backup computer system or backup extra communication lines 
even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from events that could interrupt the operations of these businesses and intend to do so for other businesses we acquire in the future  we cannot be sure that a fire  flood or other natural disaster affecting their systems would not disable the system or prevent the system from communicating with our other businesses 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications  including those embedded in equipment and facilities  use two digit rather than four digit date fields to designate an applicable year 
as a result  the systems and applications may not properly recognize the year or process data which includes it  potentially causing data miscalculations or inaccuracies or operational malfunctions or failures 
because any disruption to our computerized order processing and inventory systems could materially and adversely affect our operations  we have established a centrally managed  company wide plan to identify  evaluate and address year issues 
although most of our mission critical systems  network elements and products were verified for year compliance as of the end of june  we may still be susceptible to year related problems 
in addition  if our suppliers  service providers and or customers fail to resolve their year issues in an effective and timely manner  our business could be significantly and adversely affected 
we believe that some of our school customers have not yet addressed or resolved their year issues 
absence of dividends 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our ability to pay dividends may be restricted from time to time by the financial covenants contained in our credit agreements and debt instruments 
our current senior credit facility contains restrictions on  and in some circumstances may prevent  our payment of dividends 
leverage 
as of april   we had million of bank debt outstanding 
in addition  our leverage could increase over time 
our senior credit facility permits us to incur additional debt under certain circumstances and we expect to borrow under our senior credit facility for general corporate purposes  including working capital and for acquisitions 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our future performance 
our future performance is influenced by general economic conditions and by financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to service our debt  we may have to delay our acquisition program  sell our equity securities  sell our assets  or restructure and refinance our debt 
we cannot give our stockholders any assurance that  if we are unable to service our debt  we will be able to sell our equity securities  sell assets or restructure and refinance our debt 
our substantial debt could have important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future for our acquisitions and operations  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our debt and the interest associated with our debt  limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our property and paying dividends  subject us to risks that interest rates and our interest expense will increase  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
item properties our corporate headquarters are located at north bluemound drive  appleton  wisconsin  a combined office and warehouse facility of approximately  square feet 
our lease on the appleton headquarters expires on december   although we are currently negotiating with the owners of the facility consisting of the father and uncle of our chief executive officer  daniel p 
spalding  and one other unrelated party to purchase the property during the second quarter of fiscal see item certain relationships and related transactions for more information

the lancaster  pennsylvania facility is used for manufacturing and the fremont  nebraska facility is used for production of school forms 
we believe that our properties are adequate to support our operations for the foreseeable future 
we regularly review the consolidation of our facilities 
item legal proceedings we are  from time to time  a party to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
our management believes that none of these legal proceedings will materially or adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the valuation allowance was reversed subsequent to our being acquired by us office products  because it was deemed more likely than not  based on improved results  that such tax benefit would be realized 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are the largest marketer of non textbook educational supplies and furniture to schools for pre kindergarten through twelfth grade 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our broad product range enables us to provide our customers with one source for virtually all of their non textbook school supplies and furniture needs 
we have grown significantly in recent years both through acquisitions and internal growth 
in order to expand our geographic presence and product range  we have acquired companies since may in august  we purchased beckley cardy  our largest traditional and specialty school supply competitor 
revenues have increased from million for the fiscal year ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended april  this increase resulted primarily from acquisitions  of which occurred from fiscal through fiscal  as well as internally generated growth 
our revenues for the fiscal year ended april  were million and our operating income before non recurring acquisition and restructuring costs was million  which represented compound annual increases of and  respectively  compared to our historical results for the year ended december  while acquisitions have the effect of increasing overall revenues  there may be short term reductions in the revenues of the acquired businesses due to rationalization of product line and sales force integrations and reductions 
our gross profit margin has improved in recent years primarily due to acquisitions and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have higher gross margins than our traditional business 
in addition  our acquisitions of both specialty and traditional businesses have increased our buying power and we have used this to reduce the cost of the products we purchase 
acquisitions of traditional businesses may have a negative impact on our gross margin  although over time we should benefit from increased purchasing power leverage 
we believe that we can continue to improve our gross margins by acquiring specialty businesses and by leveraging increased purchasing power 
our operating margins have also improved significantly over the last several years 
this improvement reflects our recent acquisitions of specialty companies which have higher operating margins than our traditional businesses 
in addition  through the integration of acquired businesses  we have been able to further improve our operating margins by eliminating redundant expenses  leveraging overhead costs and improving purchasing power 
while we have already achieved significant operating margin improvements from the acquisitions we have made to date  we believe there are still opportunities to eliminate redundant expenses 
in addition  because our business is seasonal  the timing of our acquisitions may affect the comparability of our operating margins in the short term 
in particular  we have historically made many of our acquisitions during our peak selling period the first two quarters of our fiscal year when operating margins are at their highest 
because they have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  these acquisitions have caused our operating margins for the year in which the acquisitions occurred to be higher than they would have been if the results of the acquired businesses had been included for the full year 
the benefit from income taxes in fiscal of million reflects the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter 
our effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory tax rate of due primarily to non deductible goodwill amortization and state taxes 
our effective tax rate for future periods may fluctuate based on the size and structure of acquisitions and the tax deductible nature of acquired goodwill 
see consolidated historical results of operations 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from may through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our orders so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through july in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first six months of our fiscal year and operate at a loss in our third fiscal quarter 
until june   we will be limited to using the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions 
under the purchase method of accounting  the costs of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is goodwill  which is recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortized over a period of years 
we generally amortize goodwill on a straight line basis over a period of years 
in addition to the purchase price  the costs of an acquisition generally include expenses relating to the acquisition of the acquired company  including investment banking  legal and accounting fees and severance and facility closing costs 
as part of the process of integrating acquisitions  we also incur costs relating to the restructuring of various aspects of our operations  such as the consolidation of warehouse facilities  customer service centers and sales operations 
these costs typically include costs to exit the facility  such as rent under remaining lease terms  occupancy  relocation costs and facility restoration  employee costs  such as severance  and asset impairment costs 
if these costs relate solely to the operations of the acquired company and are anticipated at the time of the acquisition  they are capitalized as part of the acquisition costs 
if these costs relate to our existing operations  even if they result from an acquisition  such costs are recorded as restructuring charges in the year they are incurred and have the effect of reducing net income for that year 
we expect to incur restructuring costs from time to time in the future as we continue to acquire and integrate companies 
although we believe that the restructuring charges we have taken to date are adequate  we cannot predict the magnitude or timing of restructuring charges that we may take in the future 
school specialty was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary by us office products in delaware in february to hold its educational supplies and products division 
old school  a wisconsin corporation formed in october  was acquired by us office products in may the re print corp  the predecessor to classroomdirect 
com  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  has been in operation since and was acquired by us office products in july our consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to these two business combinations under the pooling of interests method old school and the re print corp 
are referred to as the pooled companies and include the results of companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method from their respective dates of acquisition 
prior to their respective dates of acquisition by us office products  the pooled companies reported results on years ending on december effective for fiscal  the pooled companies changed their year ends from december to a fiscal year which ends on the last saturday in april 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information as a percentage of revenues on an historical basis concerning our results of operations for the fiscal years ended april  fiscal  april  fiscal and april  fiscal 
fiscal year ended april  april  april  revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses non recurring acquisition costs restructuring costs operating income interest expense  net other income expense income before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss consolidated historical results of operations year ended april  compared to year ended april  consolidated revenues increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion in fiscal of the revenues of five businesses acquired during fiscal from their respective dates of acquisition and all of the fiscal revenues of eight businesses acquired in fiscal l whose revenues were included in fiscal only from the date of acquisition 
consolidated revenues also increased due to sales to new accounts  increased sales to existing customers and higher pricing on certain products in response to increased product costs 
gross profit increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to the acquisitions referred to above 
gross margins gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined slightly from for fiscal to for fiscal gross margins were reduced by the acquisition of beckley cardy in the second quarter of fiscal which had a lower gross margin than our existing businesses and an increase in lower margin bid revenues in our traditional businesses 
these reductions in gross margins were almost entirely offset by the positive impact of increased sales of higher margin specialty products and lower product costs due to higher vendor purchase rebates  which reflected our increased buying power 
selling  general and administrative expenses include selling expenses the most significant component of which is sales wages and commissions  catalog costs  occupancy costs  delivery costs  general administrative overhead which includes information systems and customer service and accounting  legal  human resources and purchasing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to the acquisitions referred to above 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses declined from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was the result of cost savings attributable to the integration of companies acquired during fiscal and the consolidation of our warehousing under the restructuring plan discussed below 
these savings as a percentage of revenues were offset by increases attributable to the acquisition of beckley cardy in the second quarter of fiscal which had higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than our existing businesses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to the acquisitions referred to above

 our net income for the fiscal year ended april  would have been reduced by approximately million or 
restructuring charges during fiscal included a non cash restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal  consisting of compensation expense attributed to the us office products stock option tender offer and the sale of shares of common stock to certain officers and directors  net of underwriting discounts and a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal relating to our plan to consolidate our existing warehousing  customer service and sales operations following the acquisition of beckley cardy 
under this restructuring plan  we intend to reduce our distribution centers from to eight and our customer service centers from seven to two during the period from october through december the million charge consists of million for employee severance and termination benefits  million for lease termination and facility shut down costs and million for write down of fixed assets and inventories 
on an after tax basis  these restructuring charges reduced net income for fiscal by million 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal to million  or of revenues  for fiscal primarily due to the increase in debt attributable to the acquisition of five businesses since april   partially offset by the reduction in debt from applying the net proceeds from our secondary public offering of common stock  our initial public offering of common stock and concurrent offering to certain officers and directors and the forgiveness of debt from us office products in connection with the spin off 
provision for income taxes increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of for fiscal and for fiscal the higher effective tax rate  compared to the federal statutory rate of  is primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible goodwill amortization 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  consolidated revenues increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from the eight companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method during fiscal the fiscal purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition and revenues from the six companies acquired during fiscal in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method the fiscal purchased companies and together with the fiscal purchased companies  the purchased companies for the entire period 
revenues also increased due to sales to new accounts  increased sales to existing customers and higher pricing on certain products in response to increased product costs 
product cost is the most significant element in cost of revenues 
inbound freight  occupancy and delivery charges are also included in cost of revenues 
gross profit increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to an increase in revenues from higher margin products  primarily as a result of the purchase acquisitions of three companies selling higher margin specialty product lines during fiscal  and as a result of improved purchasing power and rebate programs negotiated with vendors 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the cost of revenues as a result of the increased freight costs caused by the united parcel service strike in the summer of and an increase in the portion of revenues represented by lower margin bid revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the purchase acquisition of three specialty companies during fiscal  which typically have higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  partially offset by the efficiencies generated from the elimination of certain redundant administrative functions  including purchasing  accounting  finance and information systems  of the fiscal purchased companies and the consolidation of two warehouses into one regional facility in the northeastern us during the third quarter of fiscal we have established a month integration process for acquisitions in which a transition team is assigned to sell or discontinue incompatible business units  reduce the number of stock keeping units  eliminate redundant administrative functions  integrate the acquired entity s management information systems and improve buying power 
however  the length of time it takes us to fully implement our strategy for assimilating an acquired company can vary depending on the nature of the company acquired and the season in which it is acquired 
we use grants of employee stock options to provide an incentive to employees by increasing their ownership interests in our shares 
this helps to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders 
in connection with the spin off from us office products in june  various replacement options were issued at the prior exercise price adjusted for the spin off in accordance with apb opinion no 
if we had recorded compensation expense based upon the fair market value of the stock options on the dates of grant under the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
 our net income for the fiscal year ended april  would have been reduced by approximately million or 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately million of nonrecurring costs  primarily consisting of a write down of deferred catalog costs  employee severance and asset impairment costs  and million of the transaction costs allocated to us under the distribution agreement entered into with us office products and the other spin off companies 
we incurred non recurring acquisition costs of million in fiscal  in conjunction with the acquisition of the pooled companies 
these non recurring acquisition costs included accounting  legal  investment banking fees  real estate and environmental assessments and appraisals and various regulatory fees 
we are required by gaap to expense all acquisition costs both those paid by us and those paid by the sellers of the acquired companies related to business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
in accordance with gaap  we will be unable to use the pooling of interests method to account for acquisitions for a period of two years from june  during this period  we will not reflect any non recurring acquisition costs in our results of operations  as all costs incurred of this nature would be related to acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method and would  therefore  be capitalized as a portion of the purchase consideration 
from the time us office products acquired the pooled companies  we were allocated interest based upon our average outstanding payable balance with us office products at us office products weighted average interest rate during such period 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher amounts payable to us office products incurred as a result of the acquisition of the eight companies acquired in fiscal provision for income taxes increased from a tax benefit of million for fiscal to a tax expense of million for fiscal the high effective income tax rate of for fiscal  compared to the federal statutory rate of  was primarily due to state income taxes  non deductible goodwill amortization and us office products share of distribution costs 
in  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on a deferred tax asset resulting from the net operating loss carryforwards created during the valuation allowance had been established by one of the pooled companies prior to its acquisition by us office products to offset the tax benefit from such loss carryforwards  because at the time it was not likely that such tax benefit would be realized 
the benefit from income taxes in fiscal of million arose primarily from the reversal of the million deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter 
the valuation allowance was reversed subsequent to us office products acquiring us  because it was deemed more likely than not  based on improved results  that the tax benefit from such operating loss carryforwards would be realized 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had working capital of million 
our capitalization at april  was million and consisted of bank debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
we currently have a five year secured million revolving senior credit facility with nationsbank  na the senior credit facility has a million term loan payable quarterly over five years commencing in january and revolving loans which mature on september  the amount outstanding as of april  under the senior credit facility was approximately million  consisting of million outstanding under the revolving loan portion of the facility and million outstanding under the term loan portion of the facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are usually significantly higher during our first and second quarters to meet the working capital needs of our peak selling season 
on october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank of new york covering million of the outstanding senior credit facility 
the agreement fixes the day libor interest rate at per annum floating libor on april  was on the million notional amount and has a three year term that may be canceled by the bank of new york on the second anniversary 
as of april   the effective interest rate on borrowings under our senior credit facility was approximately 
in fiscal  we borrowed under the senior credit facility to fund five acquisitions and for seasonal working capital and capital expenditures 
on april   we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering for million in net proceeds 
on may   we sold an additional  shares of common stock to cover over allotments for million in net proceeds 
the total net proceeds to us of million were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility 
we intend to make certain immaterial changes to certain financial and other covenants under the senior credit facility 
on june   we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering for million in net proceeds 
in addition  we sold  shares of common stock in a concurrent offering directly to daniel p 
spalding  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david j 
vander zanden  our president and chief operating officer  and donald ray pate  jr  our executive vice president for classroomdirect 
com formerly named re print  at a price of per share for aggregate consideration of million 
in connection with the offerings  we incurred approximately million of expenses 
the total net proceeds to us from the offerings were million 
the net proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this net cash provided by operating activities during the period is indicative of the high seasonal nature of the business  with sales occurring in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year and cash receipts in the second and third quarters 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million for acquisitions and million for additions to property and equipment and other 
net cash provided by financing activities was million 
borrowing under the senior credit facility included million used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the holsinger acquisition  million used to fund the purchase price of the smartstuff acquisition  million used to fund the purchase price of the sportime acquisition  million used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the hammond stephens acquisition  million used to fund the beckley cardy acquisition consisting of million for the purchase price and million for debt repayment  million used to repay the us office products debt in connection with the spin off and million used for short term funding of seasonal working capital and the purchase of property and equipment 
the million net proceeds from our initial public offering and concurrent offering to certain officers and directors and million of the net proceeds from our public offering in april was used to repay a portion of the million borrowed under the senior credit facility 
us office products contributed capital of million as required under the distribution agreement entered into with us in connection with the spin off 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million for acquisitions and million for additions to property and equipment and other 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  including million provided by us office products to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and the repayment of debt assumed with the acquisition of the fiscal purchased companies  million of which was considered a contribution of capital by us office products  partially offset by million used to repay indebtedness 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was  net cash used in investing activities was million  including million for acquisitions  million for additions to property and equipment and million to pay non recurring acquisition costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  including million provided by us office products to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and the repayment of debt associated with the fiscal purchased companies and the payment of debt of the pooled companies  partially offset by million used for the net repayment of indebtedness  primarily at the fiscal purchased companies 
our anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months is approximately million 
the largest items include software development for our internet initiative  computer hardware and software and warehouse equipment 
we are currently considering  and have hired a nationally known commercial real estate agent to market  a sale and leaseback transaction involving four distribution facilities in ohio  massachusetts  kansas and texas 
we are currently seeking bids on these properties for such a transaction 
we may sell all or any number of these facilities or could substitute other properties we own in this transaction 
we believe that the current fair market value for these distribution facilities is approximately million with net proceeds to us of approximately million which would be used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility or for general corporate purposes  including working capital and for acquisitions 
if we determine to proceed with this transaction  we expect that it will close in the second quarter of fiscal fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year may october primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquired may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal and in thousands 
we derived this data from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information 
revenues and profitability are significantly higher in the months of may through october  with the most significant portion of revenue and profit occurring in the months of july through september

year ended april  first second third fourth total revenues      gross profit      operating income loss      net income loss      per share amounts basic diluted inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  recent accounting pronouncements reporting comprehensive income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
we adopted sfas no in fiscal implementation of this disclosure standard did not affect our financial position or results of operations 
disclosures about segments 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  and is presented in this annual report 
financial statement disclosures for prior periods are required to be restated 
implementation of this disclosure standard did not affect our financial position or results of operations 
accounting for the costs of computer software 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met 
we adopted sop during fiscal adoption of sop did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  which is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after june   establishes standards for recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
we will implement this statement in fiscal as required 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications  including those embedded in equipment and facilities  use two digit rather than four digit date fields to designate an applicable year 
as a result  the systems and applications may not properly recognize the year or process data which include it  potentially causing data miscalculations or inaccuracies or operational malfunctions or failures 
because any disruption to our computerized order processing and inventory systems could materially and adversely affect our operations  we have established a centrally managed  company wide plan to identify  evaluate and address year issues 
although most of our mission critical systems  network elements and products were verified for year compliance as of the end of june  we may still be susceptible to year related problems 
in addition  if our suppliers  service providers and or customers fail to resolve their year issues in an effective and timely manner  our business could be significantly and adversely affected 
we believe that some of our school customers have not yet addressed or resolved their year issues 
we currently estimate that we will incur expenses of approximately  through calendar in connection with our anticipated year efforts  in addition to approximately  in expenses incurred through april  for matters historically identified as year related 
the timing of expenses may vary and is not necessarily indicative of readiness efforts or progress to date 
we also expect to incur certain capital improvement costs totaling approximately  to support this project 
such capital costs are being incurred sooner than originally planned  but  for the most part  would have been required in the normal course of business 
we expect to fund our year efforts through operating cash flows 
we will use our senior credit facility for capital improvements related to the effort 
as part of our year initiative  we are evaluating scenarios that may occur as a result of the century change and are in the process of developing contingency and business continuity plans tailored for year related occurrences 
as noted earlier  we are highly reliant on our computer order processing and inventory systems to fill orders  bill the customer and collect payments 
a loss of either of these systems would cause long delays in filling and shipping products  billing the customer and collecting accounts receivable 
the highly seasonal nature of our business does not allow for any delay in shipping products to customers 
although the seasonal nature of our business would heighten any problems encountered  the timing of the majority of our sales  shipping  billing and collection efforts for fiscal will be complete prior to the year we expect that any unforeseen problems related to year issues would be identified within the months of january and february  which is our slowest period 
we have identified that we may experience certain inconveniences or inefficiencies as a result of a supplier s failure to remediate its year issue 
we believe  however  that most of our business will proceed without any significant interruption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
the estimated fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value at april  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement during fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
this interest rate swap agreement has the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate we will pay on the million notional principal amount established in the swap 
as a result  while this hedging arrangement is structured to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
this swap is usually cash settled monthly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
effects of this swap have been minor for the year ending april
