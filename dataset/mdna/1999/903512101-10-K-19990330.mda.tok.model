item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have experienced a number of significant events during the past three years 
some of the more important events follow o during we o completed our initial public offering and secondary offering of common stock generating a total of million in cash 
o during we o completed a private placement of common stock in february generating million in cash  o completed a conversion of one of our loan servicing systems 
we experienced various transitional problems with the conversion  which resulted in a charge of million approximately million  net of income taxes to write down our residuals in finance receivables sold  o completed three significant acquisitions and developed new stores to increase our total number of dealerships in operation from seven to at december   and o expanded our dealership chain from two markets at the end of to ten markets at the end of o during we o closed our branch office network resulting in two significant charges to discontinued operations totaling million approximately million  net of income taxes  o completed the conversion of our dealerships to a single computer system  o attempted to split up the company through a rights offering to our stockholders 
we terminated the rights offering due to a lack of stockholder participation 
although the rights offering was unsuccessful  the exercise of splitting the operations and management teams has proven beneficial to each of our businesses  o completed an exchange offer whereby we issued million in subordinated debentures and repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock  and o changed the way we structure our securitization transactions for accounting purposes from a sale to a financing 
the change had a significant effect on earnings in in this discussion and analysis we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations of ugly duckling and its subsidiaries 
in particular  we analyze and explain the annual changes in the results of operations of our various business segments 
as you read this discussion  you should refer to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page  which contain the results of our operations for   and results of operations years ended december   and income items in our statement of operations consist of o sales of used cars less cost of used cars sold less provision for credit losses o interest income o gain on sale of loans o servicing and other income sales of used cars and cost of used cars sold dollars in thousands used cars sold units    sales of used cars    cost of used cars sold    gross margin    gross margin per unit sold sales    cost of used cars sold    gross margin    the number of cars sold units increased by for the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to an increase of over the year ended december  same store unit sales in the year ended december  were compararable to the year ended december  we anticipate future revenue growth would come from increasing the number of dealerships and not from higher sales volumes at existing dealerships 
same store unit sales declined by in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we believe that this decline was due primarily to the increased emphasis on underwriting at our dealerships  particularly at one dealership where unit sales decreased by units  which represents of the net decrease for the year ended december  sales of used cars revenues increased by for the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to a increase over the year ended december  the growth for these periods reflects increases in the number of dealerships in operation and the average unit sales price 
the cost of used cars sold increased by for the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to an increase of over the year ended december  the gross margin on used car sales sales of used cars less cost of used cars sold excluding provision for credit losses increased by for the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to an increase of over the year ended december  the gross margin percentage has increased over the past two years  as we have been successful in increasing our sales prices by more than the increase in the cost of used cars sold 
our average sales price per car increased by for the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to a increase in the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in the average sales price was necessary to offset the increase in the cost of used cars sold 
on a per unit basis  the cost of used cars sold increased by for the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to an increase of over the year ended december  provision for credit losses we record provisions for credit losses in our dealership operations and our non dealership operations 
dealership operations 
following is a summary of the provision for credit losses from our dealership operations provision for credit losses in thousands    provision per contract originated    provision as a percentage of principal balances originated the provision for credit losses in our dealership operations increased by in the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to an increase of over the year ended december  the provision for credit losses per unit originated at our dealerships increased by in the year ended december  over the year ended december   compared to an increase of over the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the average amount financed to  per unit in the year ended december  from  per unit in the year ended december  and from the change in our securitization structure beginning in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of dealership contract principal balances originated  the provision for credit losses averaged for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  when we changed how we structure securitizations for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of  we also changed the timing of providing for credit losses 
for periods prior to the fourth quarter of  we generally provided a provision for credit losses of approximately of the loan principal balance at the time of origination to record the loan at the lower of cost or market 
however  as a consequence of our revised securitization structure  we will now be retaining securitized loans on our balance sheet and recognizing income over the life of the contracts 
therefore  for loans originated in the fourth quarter of  we increased the provision for credit losses to of the principal balance at the time of origination 
we also increased the provision for credit losses to on loans originated in prior periods that had not been securitized prior to the fourth quarter 
non dealership operations 
the provision for credit losses in our non dealership operations increased by to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the significant increase in loans under the cygnet dealer program 
there was no provision for credit losses in our non dealership operations in  since there was no significant activity until see allowance for credit losses below 
interest income we generate interest income from both our dealership operations and our non dealership operations 
dealership operations 
interest income consists primarily of interest on finance receivables from our dealership sales and income from residuals in finance receivables sold from our prior securitizations 
interest income increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which increased by from million in the year ended december  the increases were primarily due to the increase in the average finance receivables retained on our balance sheet during these periods 
however  because we structured most of our securitizations to recognize income as sales during   and  interest income was lower than if we had structured the securitizations as secured financings for accounting purposes 
a primary element of our sales strategy is to provide financing to our customers  almost all of whom are sub prime borrowers 
as summarized in the following table  we continue to increase the percentage of sales revenue financed  and the number of units sold 
percentage of sales revenue financed percentage of used cars sold financed 
as a result of our expansion into markets with interest rate limits  the yield on our dealership receivable contracts has gone down 
the average effective yield on finance receivables from our dealerships was approximately for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  our policy is to charge per year on our dealership contracts 
however  in those states that impose interest rate limits  we charge the maximum interest rate permitted 
non dealership operations 
in our non dealership operations  we generate interest income primarily from a loan we made to fmac as part of its bankruptcy proceedings  and from our cygnet dealer program 
interest income from the fmac transaction decreased by to million from million in when we originated the fmac loan 
during a portion of  in addition to our debtor in possession loan to fmac  we held other notes receivable from fmac totaling approximately million 
we sold receivables that secured the notes for a gain at the end of interest income from the cygnet dealer program increased by to million from million in when the cygnet dealer program commenced significant operations 
the increase in interest income in the cygnet dealer program reflects a significant increase in the amount of loans outstanding during compared to gain on sale of loans a summary of gain on sale of loans follows dollar amounts in thousands dealership operations    non dealership operations  gain on sale of loans as a percentage of principal balances securitized dealership operations excluding a million charge in described below dealership operations 
we recorded gain on sale of loans related to securitization transactions of million during the year ended december   million net of a million charge during the year ended december   and million during the year ended december  we recorded a million charge approximately million net of income taxes in the third quarter of in order to adjust our assumptions related to our previously completed securitization transactions 
the decrease in gain on sale excluding the million charge in as a percentage of principal balances securitized in compared to is primarily due to the use of a higher cumulative charge off assumption in the securitizations and the securitized portfolios in having a shorter weighted average life than those in the increase in gain on sale excluding the million charge in as a percentage of principal balances securitized in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rate of the underlying class a certificates 
see securitizations dealership operations below for a summary of the structure of our securitizations 
non dealership operations 
during  our non dealership operations entered into a series of transactions with fmac including transactions in which we acquired of fmac s senior bank debt 
when fmac put the finance contracts securing this debt up for bid  we purchased the contracts by releasing the debt 
we then sold the contracts to a third party purchaser 
we recorded a one time gain of million from this transaction

servicing and other income we generate servicing and other income from both our dealership operations and our non dealership operations 
a summary of servicing and other income follows in thousands non dealership dealership operations operations company company dealership corporate cygnet dealerships receivables and other loan servicing total dealership operations 
servicing and other income increased by to million in the year ended december  over the million recognized in  which was an increase of over the million in we service our securitized contracts for monthly fees ranging from 
to 
of the beginning of month principal balances to per year 
the significant increase in servicing and other income is primarily due to the increase in the principal balance of contracts being serviced under the securitization program and the addition in of the kars portfolio 
although we acquired several dealerships in the kars transaction  the owners retained the loan portfolio  which we service 
in addition  the increase in was also due to our investment income on the proceeds from our private placement that we closed in february we recorded earnings on these investments of million compared to no investment earnings in the year ended december  non dealership operations 
in april  we began servicing loans on behalf of fmac 
shortly thereafter  we entered into additional agreements to service loan portfolios on behalf of other third parties 
our servicing fee is generally a percentage of the portfolio balance generally to per year with a minimum fee per loan serviced generally to per month 
servicing and other income totaled million in the year ended december   compared to  in and in our non dealership operations have entered into servicing agreements with two companies that have filed and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy and continue to operate under their approved plans of reorganization 
under the terms of the respective servicing agreements and approved plans of reorganization  once certain creditors of the bankrupt companies have been paid in full  we are entitled to certain incentive compensation in excess of the servicing fees that we have earned to date 
under the terms of the agreements with fmac  we are scheduled to receive of all collections of the serviced portfolio once the specified creditors have been paid in full 
see business non dealership operations bulk purchasing and loan servicing operations 
under the terms of the second agreement  we are scheduled to receive the first million in collections once the specified creditors have been paid in full and thereafter 
we are required to issue warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock to the extent we receive the million and  in addition  will be required to issue  warrants for each million in incentive fee income we receive after we collect the million 
as of december   we estimate that the incentive compensation could range from to million under both agreements 
we have not accrued any fee income from these incentives 
income before operating expenses as a result of our continued expansion  income before operating expenses grew by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of from million in growth of sales of used cars  interest income  gain on sale of loans  and servicing and other income were the primary contributors to the increase 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of o selling and marketing expenses  o general and administrative expenses  and o depreciation and amortization

selling and marketing expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was an increase of from million in the decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of sales of used cars and on a per unit basis from to is due to the significant increase in the number of cars sold in compared to  and to the fact that we did not enter any new markets in the significant increase in per unit marketing in was primarily due to our expansion into several new markets 
we operated dealerships in ten markets during  compared to two markets in as a result of this expansion  we incurred significant marketing costs in in new markets in an effort to establish brand name recognition 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the increased number of used car dealerships in operations  as well the expansion of our bulk purchasing and loan servicing operations  the cygnet dealer program  and continued expansion of infrastructure to administer growth 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended includes a million charge million  net of income taxes to write off costs associated with the rights offering 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization on our property and equipment and amortization of goodwill and trademarks 
depreciation and amortization increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was an increase of over the million incurred in the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to increases in amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisitions  increased depreciation expense from the addition of used car dealerships and the addition of four loan servicing facilities in to support our bulk purchase and loan servicing operations 
interest expense interest expense increased by to million in from million in  which was an increase of from million in the increase in was primarily due to increased borrowings of notes payable and subordinated notes payable 
the relatively small increase in  despite significant growth in our total assets  was primarily the result of the private placement of common stock that we completed in february our private placement generated million in cash which we used to pay down debt 
income taxes income taxes totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  in  we reversed all of the valuation allowance that existed against our deferred income tax assets as of december   which significantly reduced our effective income tax rate 
discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits  increased by million to million in from  in  which was an improvement from the  loss we incurred in the significant increase in the loss in was due to the charges we recorded totaling million million  net of income taxes to close our branch office network 
financial position total assets increased by to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due in part to an increase in finance receivables of million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in finance receivables was primarily due to a significant increase in loans under the cygnet dealer program  and a change in the structure of our securitization transactions for accounting purposes which resulted in us retaining on balance sheet the finance receivables we securitized in the fourth quarter of we previously structured securitizations as sales for accounting purposes and we removed the related finance receivables from the balance sheet upon securitization 
additionally  our dealership network increased from dealerships at december  to at december  the increase in the number of our dealerships resulted in an increase in inventory of million to million at december  from million at december  we financed the increases in assets primarily through additional borrowings  represented by increases in notes payable  collateralized notes payable  and subordinated notes payable 
notes payable and collateralized notes payable increased by million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the change in our securitization structure 
we retained the debt related to the securitization transaction we closed in the fourth quarter of on our balance sheet 
subordinated notes payable increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in subordinated notes payable was primarily due to the addition of million in subordinated notes used for working capital and other uses and approximately million used to repurchase our common stock in an exchange transaction

growth in finance receivables 
as a result of our rapid expansion  contract receivables managed by our dealership operations have increased significantly during the past three years

in addition to the loan portfolio summarized above  our dealership operations also serviced loan portfolios totaling approximately million million for kars and million from our branch office network as of december   and million million for kars and million from our branch office network as of december  our non dealership operations began servicing loans on behalf of fmac on april   and began servicing additional loan portfolios on behalf of other third parties throughout by december   our non dealership bulk purchasing loan servicing operations were servicing a total of million in finance receivables approximately  contracts 
allowance for credit losses we have established an allowance for credit losses allowance to cover anticipated credit losses on the contracts currently in our portfolio 
we established the allowance by recording an expense through the provision for credit losses 
for finance receivables generated at our dealerships  our policy is to charge off a contract the earlier of o when we believe it is uncollectible  or o when it is delinquent for more than days 
the following table reflects activity in the allowance  as well as information regarding charge off activity  for the years ended december  and  in thousands

as we intend to hold the balance sheet portfolio for investment and not for sale  we increased the provision for credit losses to of the principal balance for loans originated in the fourth quarter of the allowance on contracts from non dealership operations was of the outstanding principal balances as of december  and of outstanding principal balances as of december  in addition  our non dealership operations held non refundable discounts and security deposits from third party dealers totaling million  which represented of outstanding principal balances as of december  our non dealership operations held non refundable discounts and security deposits from third party dealers totaling million  which represented of the outstanding principal balances as of december  even though a contract is charged off  we continue to attempt to collect the contract 
recoveries as a percentage of principal balances charged off from dealership operations averaged for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  recoveries as a percentage of principal balances charged off from non dealership operations averaged for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   when we recorded only one charge off against the allowance 
for finance receivables acquired by our non dealership operations with recourse to the seller  our general policy is to exercise the recourse provisions in our agreements under the cygnet dealer program when a contract is delinquent for days 
for contracts not purchased with recourse  our policy is similar to that of our dealership operations 
static pool analysis we use a static pool analysis to monitor performance for contracts we have originated at our dealerships 
in a static pool analysis  we assign each month s originations to a unique pool and track the charge offs for each pool separately 
we calculate the cumulative net charge offs for each pool as a percentage of that pool s original principal balances  based on the number of complete payments made by the customer before charge off 
the table below displays the cumulative net charge offs of each pool as a percentage of original contract cumulative balances  based on the quarter the loans were originated 
the table is further stratified by the number of payments made by our customers prior to charge off 
for periods denoted by x  the pools have not seasoned sufficiently to allow us to compute cumulative losses 
for periods denoted by  the pools have not yet reached the indicated cumulative age 
while we monitor static pools on a monthly basis  for presentation purposes  we are presenting the information in the table below on a quarterly basis 
currently reported cumulative losses may vary from those previously reported for the reasons listed below  however  management believes that such variation will not be material o ongoing collection efforts on charged off accounts  and o the difference between final proceeds on the sale of repossessed collateral versus our estimates of the sale proceeds 
the following table sets forth as of february   the cumulative net charge offs as a percentage of original contract cumulative pool balances  based on the quarter of origination and segmented by the number of monthly payments completed by customers before charge off

for the securitization transactions closed prior to the fourth quarter of  we recognized a gain on sale of loans equal to the difference between the sales proceeds for the finance receivables sold and our recorded investment in the finance receivables sold 
our investment in finance receivables consisted of the principal balance of the finance receivables securitized net of the allowance for credit losses related to the securitized receivables 
we then reduced our allowance for credit losses by the amount of allowance for credit losses related to the loans securitized 
we allocated the recorded investment in the finance receivables between the portion of the finance receivables sold and the portion retained based on the relative fair values on the date of sale 
in the fourth quarter of we announced that we were changing the way we structure transactions under our securitization program for accounting purposes 
through september   we had structured these transactions as sales for accounting purposes 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began structuring securitizations for accounting purposes to recognize the income over the life of the contracts 
this change will not affect our prior securitizations 
historically  gain on sale of loans has been material to our reported revenues and net earnings 
altering the structure of these transactions so that no gain is recognized at the time of a securitization transaction will have a material effect on our reported revenues and net earnings until such time as we accumulate finance receivables on our balance sheet sufficient to generate interest income net of interest  credit losses  and other expenses equivalent to the revenues that we had historically recognized on our securitization transactions 
under our securitization program  we sell the securitized finance receivables to our securitization subsidiaries who then assign and transfer the finance receivables to separate trusts 
the trusts issue class a certificates and subordinated class b certificates residuals in finance receivables sold to the securitization subsidiaries 
the securitization subsidiaries then sell the class a certificates to the investors and retain the class b certificates 
we continue to service the securitized contracts 
the class a certificates from our securitization transactions have historically received investment grade ratings 
to secure the payment of the class a certificates  the securitization subsidiaries have o obtained an insurance policy from mbia insurance corporation which guarantees payment of amounts to the holders of the class a certificates for transactions closed after july   and o established a cash spread account essentially  a reserve account for the benefit of the certificate holders 
spread account requirements 
the securitization subsidiaries make an initial cash deposit into the spread account  generally equivalent to of the initial underlying finance receivables principal balance and pledge this cash to the spread account agent 
the trustee then makes additional deposits to the spread account out of collections on the securitized receivables as necessary to fund the spread account to a specified percentage  ranging from to  of the underlying finance receivables principal balance 
the trustee will not make distributions to the securitization subsidiaries on the class b certificates unless o the spread account has the required balance  o the required periodic payments to the class a certificate holders are current  and o the trustee  servicer and other administrative costs are current 
during  we made initial spread account deposits totaling approximately million 
the required spread account balance based upon the targeted percentages was approximately million at december  with balances in the spread accounts totaling approximately million 
therefore  the amount remaining to be funded to meet the targeted balance was approximately million as of december  in addition to the spread account balance of million at december   we also had deposited a total of million in trust accounts in conjunction with certain other agreements 
we also maintain spread accounts for the securitization transactions that were consummated by our discontinued operations 
we had satisfied the spread account funding obligation of million as of december  with respect to these securitization transactions 
certain financial information regarding our securitizations 
during the first three quarters of  we securitized an aggregate of million in contracts  issuing million in class a certificates  and million in class b certificates 
during the fourth quarter of  we securitized million in contracts  issuing million of class a certificates 
due to the revised securitization structure  the million of loans remained classified as finance receivables  and the million in class a certificates were classified as notes payable in our consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended december   we securitized an aggregate of million in contracts  issuing million in class a certificates  and million in class b certificates 
in  we securitized an aggregate of million in contracts  issuing million in class a certificates  and million in class b certificates 
we recorded the carrying value of the residuals in finance receivables sold at million in  and million in the balance of the residuals in finance receivables sold was million as of december  and million as of december  the table below summarizes certain attributes of our securitizations weighted average yield of certificates issued range of yields for certificates issued average net spreads after fees and expenses range of net spreads after fees and expenses the decrease in net spreads from to  despite lower certificate yields  is primarily the result of the decrease in the average contract yield of the finance receivable contracts securitized due to our expansion into markets with interest rate limits 
residuals in finance receivables sold  which are a component of finance receivables  represent our retained portion the class b certificates of the loans we securitized prior to the fourth quarter of we utilize a number of assumptions to determine the initial value of the residuals in finance receivables sold 
the residuals in finance receivables sold represent the present value of the expected net cash flows of the securitization trusts using the out of the trust method 
the net cash flows out of the trusts are the collections on the loans in the trust in excess of the class a certificate principal and interest payments and certain other trust expenses 
the assumptions used to compute the residuals in finance receivables sold include  but are not limited to o charge off rates  o repossession recovery rates  o portfolio delinquency  o prepayment rates  and o trust expenses 
the residuals in finance receivables sold are adjusted monthly to approximate the present value of the expected remaining net cash flows out of the trust 
to the extent that actual cash flows on a securitization are below our original estimates  and those differences appear to be other than temporary in nature  we are required to revalue residuals in finance receivables sold and record a charge to earnings based upon the reduction 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge approximately million  net of income taxes to dealership operations to write down the residuals in finance receivables sold 
we determined a write down in the residuals in finance receivables sold was necessary due to an increase in net losses in the securitized loan portfolio 
the charge resulted in a reduction in the carrying value of the our residuals in finance receivables sold and had the effect of increasing the cumulative net loss at loan origination assumption to approximately for the securitization transactions that took place prior to september  the revised loss assumption approximates the assumption used for the securitization transaction consummated during the third quarter of for the securitizations that we completed during the nine month period ended september   net losses were estimated using total expected cumulative net losses at loan origination of approximately  adjusted for actual cumulative net losses prior to securitization 
one of the assumptions inherent in the valuation of the residuals in finance receivables sold is the projected portfolio net charge offs 
the remaining net charge offs in the residuals in finance receivables sold as a percentage of the remaining principal balances of securitized contracts was approximately as of december   compared to as of december  this decrease is primarily due to having a more seasoned securitized portfolio as of december  than at december  as a greater portion of our losses tend to take place in the early stages of the portfolio s existence  a more seasoned portfolio will have fewer losses remaining than a portfolio that has not aged as much 
there can be no assurance that the charge we recorded in the third quarter of was sufficient and that we will not need to record additional charges in the future in order to write down the residuals in finance receivables sold 
we classify the residuals as held to maturity securities in accordance with sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources in recent periods  our needs for additional capital resources have increased in connection with the growth of our business 
we require capital for o increases in our contract portfolio  o expansion of our dealership network  o our commitments under the fmac transaction  o expansion of the cygnet dealer program  o common stock repurchases  o the purchase of inventories  o the purchase of property and equipment  and o working capital and general corporate purposes 
we fund our capital requirements primarily through o operating cash flow  o our revolving facility with general electric capital corporation  o securitization transactions  o supplemental borrowings  and o in the past  equity offerings 
while to date we have met our liquidity requirements as needed  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
operating cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in the year ended december  to million from cash used in the year ended december  of million 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in the loss from discontinued operations  the provision for credit losses  and proceeds from the sale of finance receivables  net of decreases in net earnings and purchases of finance receivables 
net cash used by operating activities totaled million in the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in this increase in cash used in over cash provided in was primarily due to increases in the purchases of finance receivables and inventory  and a reduction in collections of finance receivables  net of increases in the provision for credit losses and proceeds from the sale of finance receivables 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to increases in cash used in investing activities from purchases of finance receivables  net decreases in cash advanced under our notes receivable  increased collections of notes receivable  and a reduction in payment for acquisition of assets 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the increase was due primarily to net increases in notes receivable of million and payment for acquisition of assets of million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period in the decrease is due to increases in notes payable  net of increases in repayments of notes payable and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increases in the issuance of notes payable  reduction in repayments of notes payable and a lack of any redemption of preferred stock 
financing resources revolving facility 
in september  we amended our revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation ge capital increasing the maximum commitment to million 
under the revolving facility  we may borrow o up to of the principal balance of eligible contracts originated from the sale of used cars  o up to of the principal balance of eligible contracts previously originated by our branch office network  o the lesser of million or of the direct vehicle costs for eligible vehicle inventory  and o starting in january  the lesser of million or of eligible contracts or loans originated under the cygnet dealer program

garcia ii owns less than of our voting stock 
mr 
garcia owned approximately of our common stock at december  in addition  we are also required to o be year compliant no later than june  see discussion below under year readiness disclosure  and o maintain specified financial ratios  including a debt to equity ratio of to and a net worth of at least  under the terms of the revolving facility  we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio and a cash flow based interest coverage ratio that we failed to satisfy during the year ended december  we failed to meet these covenants primarily as a result of the charges we took during for the closure of our branch office network 
ge capital has waived the covenant violations as of december  securitizations 
our securitization program is a primary source of our working capital 
since september   we have closed all of our securitizations with private investors through greenwich capital markets  inc greenwich capital 
in march  we executed a commitment letter with greenwich capital to act as our exclusive agent in placing up to million of surety wrapped securities under our securitization program 
securitizations generate cash flow for us from o the sale of class a certificates  o ongoing servicing fees  and o excess cash flow distributions from collections on the contracts securitized after o payments on the class a certificates sold to third party investors  o payment of fees  expenses  and insurance premiums  and o required deposits to the spread account 
securitization also allows us to fix our cost of funds for a given contract portfolio 
failure to regularly engage in securitization transactions will adversely affect us

supplemental borrowings verde debt 
prior to our public offering in september  we historically borrowed substantial amounts from verde investments inc verde  which is owned by our chairman and chief executive officer  ernest c 
garcia 
the subordinated notes payable balances outstanding to verde totaled million as of december  and million as of december  prior to september   these borrowings accrued interest at an annual rate of 
effective september   the annual interest rate on these borrowings was reduced to 
under the terms of this note  we are required to make monthly payments of interest and annual payments of principal in the amount of million 
except for the debt incurred related to the exchange offer see below  this debt is junior to all of our other indebtedness and we may suspend interest and principal payments if we are in default on obligations to any other creditors 
in july  our board of directors approved the prepayment of the million in subordinated debt after the earlier of the following o the completion of a debt offering  or o at such time as the following o the fmac transactions have been completed or the cash requirements for completion of the transaction are known  or o we either have cash in excess of our current needs or have funds available under our financing sources in excess of our current needs 
no such prepayment has been made as of the date of filing of this form k 
any prepayment would require the consent of certain of our lenders 
senior subordinated notes 
in february  we borrowed a total of million of subordinated debt from unrelated third parties for a three year term 
we pay interest on this debt quarterly at per annum 
this debt is o senior to the verde subordinated note described above and the subordinated debentures issued in our exchange offer described below  and o subordinate to our other indebtedness 
we issued warrants to the lenders of this debt to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable at any time until the later of february  or when the debt is paid in full 
in july  we borrowed a total of million in subordinated debt from unrelated third parties for a three year term 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we were required to issue warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock by december  if the loan was not paid in full by that date 
the warrants were to have been issued at an exercise price of of the average trading price for our common stock for the consecutive trading days prior to the issuance of the warrants 
in january  we prepaid million of the loans and the lenders waived their right to a proportionate amount of the warrants 
we have agreed to pay million by march  and the remaining million on june  we will not be required to issue the warrants if we repay the loans on these dates 
sale leaseback of real property 
in march  we executed an agreement with an investment company for the sale and leaseback of up to million in real property 
we sold certain real property to the investment company for its original cost and leased back the properties for an initial term of twenty years 
we have the right to extend the leases in certain cases 
we pay monthly rents of approximately one twelfth of of the purchase price plus all occupancy costs and taxes 
the agreement calls for annual increases in monthly rent of not less than 
as of december   we had sold approximately million of property under this arrangement 
however  we do not anticipate closing any additional transactions under this agreement with the investment company 
we used substantially all of the proceeds from the sales to pay down debt 
exchange offer 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for approximately million of subordinated debentures 
the debentures are unsecured and are subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness 
we must pay interest on the debentures twice a year at per year 
we are required to pay the principal amount of the debentures on october  we issued the debentures at a premium of approximately million over the market value of the shares of our common stock that were exchanged for the debentures 
accordingly  the debt was recorded at million on our balance sheet 
the premium will be amortized over the life of the debentures and results in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 
we can redeem all or part of the debentures at any time 
as a result of the exchange offer  the number of our common shares outstanding decreased to approximately  compared to approximately  shares outstanding prior to the exchange offer 
additional financing 
on november   we borrowed million for a term of days from greenwich capital 
we pay interest on this loan at an interest rate equal to libor plus basis points 
we secured the loan with the common stock of our securitization subsidiaries 
in march  we borrowed million for a term of days from greenwich capital 
million was used to repay the remaining balance of the million greenwich capital loan 
the new loan was secured by the common stock of our securitization subsidiaries 
the interest rate is at libor plus basis points and we paid an origination fee of basis points 
in march  we executed a commitment letter with greenwich capital in which  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  greenwich capital agreed to provide us with a million surety wrapped warehouse line of credit at a rate equal to libor plus basis points 
in addition  on march   we borrowed approximately million from greenwich capital under a repurchase facility with a advance rate  bearing interest at  and maturing may  debt shelf registration 
in  we registered up to million of our debt securities under the securities act of there can be no assurance that we will be able to use this registration statement to sell debt securities  or successfully register and sell other debt securities in the future 
capital expenditures and commitments we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy 
during the year ended december   we opened new dealerships 
we also have six more dealerships under development 
the magnitude of the direct cost of opening a dealership is primarily a function of whether we lease a facility or construct a facility 
a leased facility costs approximately  to develop  while a facility we construct costs approximately million 
in addition  we require capital to finance the portfolio that we carry on our balance sheet for each store 
it takes approximately million in cash to support a typical stabilized store portfolio with our existing advance rate under our ge facility 
additionally  it takes approximately months for a store portfolio to reach a stabilized level 
on july   we entered into an agreement to provide debtor in possession financing to fmac the dip facility 
as of december   the maximum commitment on the dip facility was million and the outstanding balance on the dip facility totaled million 
subsequent to december   the maximum commitment was reduced to million from the receipt of certain income tax refunds received by fmac and remitted to us 
see business non dealership operations bulk purchasing and loan servicing operations dip facility 
we intend to finance the construction of new dealerships and the dip financing through operating cash flows and supplemental borrowings  including amounts available under the revolving facility and the securitization program 
common stock repurchase program 
in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to one million shares of our common stock from time to time 
purchases may be made depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
our board of directors extended the stock repurchase program in february  to december  during  we repurchased  shares of common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
subsequent to december   we repurchased approximately  additional shares of common stock under this program 
since january   we have repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the exchange offer described above at an average cost of approximately per share 
in september  our board of directors approved a director and senior officer stock purchase loan program 
we may make loans of up to million in total to the directors and senior officers under the program to assist directors and officers purchases of common stock on the open market 
these unsecured loans bear interest at per year 
during  senior officers purchased  shares of common stock under this program and we loaned  to the senior officers for these purchases 
during  we made additional loans under similar terms and conditions to senior officers totaling approximately  for the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
year readiness disclosure many older computer programs refer to years only in terms of their final two digits 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
the problem affects not only computer software  but also computer hardware and other systems containing processors and embedded chips 
business systems affected by this problem may not be able to accurately process date related information before  during or after january  this is commonly referred to as the year problem 
our business could be materially adversely affected by failures of our own business systems due to the year problem as well as those of our suppliers and business partners 
we are in the process of addressing these issues 
our year compliance program consists of o identification and assessment of critical computer programs  hardware and other business equipment and systems  o remediation and testing  o assessment of the year readiness of our critical suppliers  vendors and business partners  and o contingency planning 
identification and assessment the first component of our year compliance program is complete 
we have identified our critical computer programs  hardware  and other equipment to determine which systems are compliant  or must be replaced or remediated 
remediation and testing dealership operations 
we recently completed converting our dealership operations to a single automobile sales and loan servicing system the class system  which has reduced the scope of our compliance program 
we have engaged an outside consulting firm to assist us with remediating our critical computer programs that must become year compliant 
we have finished remediating the program code and underlying data in the class system and are currently performing regression testing on the program code modifications 
we anticipate placing the modified program code into production and performing future date testing on the modified code in april non dealership operations 
our non dealership loan servicing operations currently utilize several loan processing and collections programs provided through third party service bureaus 
based upon certifications we have received from the software vendors  and independent testing we have performed  we believe that our loan processing and collections programs are year compliant 
our cygnet dealer program utilizes one of the same loan processing and collections programs used by our loan servicing operations 
the service bureau that provides the program has written a custom module for us and has stated the custom module is year compliant 
we anticipate performing and completing independent year compliance testing in may we believe the remediation of the critical business systems used by our dealership and non dealership operations will be substantially completed during the second quarter of assessment of business partners we have also identified critical suppliers  vendors  and other business partners and we are taking steps to determine their year readiness 
these steps include interviews  questionnaires  and other types of inquiries 
because of the large number of business systems that our business partners use and their varying levels of year readiness  it is difficult to determine how any year issues of our business partners will affect us 
we are not currently aware of any business relationships with third parties that we believe will likely result in a significant disruption of our businesses 
we believe that our greatest risk is with our utility suppliers  banking and financial institution partners  and suppliers of telecommunications services  all of which are operating within the united states 
potential consequences if we  or our business partners  are not year compliant include o failure to operate from a lack of power  o shortage of cash flow  o disruption or errors in loan collection and processing efforts  and o delays in receiving inventory  supplies  and services 
if any of these events occurred  the results could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations 
contingency plans we are also developing contingency plans to mitigate the risks that could occur in the event of a year business disruption 
contingency plans may include o increasing inventory levels  o securing additional financing  o relocating operations to unaffected sites  o vendor supplier replacement  o utilizing temporary manual or spreadsheet based processes  or o other prudent actions 
we currently estimate that remediation and testing of our business systems will cost between million and million 
most of these costs will be expensed and funded by our operating line of credit 
expenses to date approximate million  including approximately  of internal payroll costs  substantially all of which have been charged to general and administrative expense 
we cannot currently estimate costs associated with developing and implementing contingency measures 
the scheduled completion dates and costs associated with the various components of our year compliance program described above are estimates and are subject to change 
seasonality historically  we have experienced higher revenues in the first two quarters of the year than in the latter half of the year 
we believe that these results are due to seasonal buying patterns because many of our customers receive income tax refunds during the first half of the year  which are a primary source of down payments on used car purchases 
inflation increases in inflation generally result in higher interest rates 
higher interest rates on our borrowings would decrease the profitability of our existing portfolio 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
we seek to limit this risk o through our securitization program  which allows us to fix our borrowing costs  o by increasing the interest rate charged for contracts originated at our dealerships if allowed under applicable law  or o by increasing the profit margin on the cars sold  and for contracts acquired from third party dealers under our cygnet dealer program  either by acquiring contracts at a higher discount or with a higher apr

risk factors there are various risks in purchasing our securities or investing in our business  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all other information included in this form k 
we make forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of revenues  income  or loss  estimates of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  products or services  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to these matters 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made 
they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which we cannot predict or quantify 
future events and actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements 
when considering each forward looking statement  you should keep in mind the risk factors and cautionary statements found throughout this form k and specifically those found below 
we are not obligated to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or for any other reason 
we have incurred net losses in three of the last five years and could incur additional net losses in future periods 
we began operations in and incurred significant operating losses in and although we recorded net earnings in and  we incurred a net loss of million in a substantial portion of our net earnings in and was attributable to the gains recognized on our securitization transactions 
the net loss in was due in large part to o a charge of approximately million million  net of income taxes to discontinued operations in the first quarter of for the closure of the branch office network  o a charge of approximately million million  net of income taxes to discontinued operations during the third quarter of due primarily to higher than anticipated loan losses and servicing expenses in connection with the branch office loan portfolio and to costs incurred in our terminated rights offering  and o a change in the fourth quarter of in the way we structure securitization transactions for accounting purposes 
there can be no assurance that we will be profitable again in future periods 
our failure to be profitable can adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities 
factors determining our future profitability 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend primarily upon our ability to o expand our revenue generating operations while not proportionately increasing our administrative overhead  o originate and purchase contracts with an acceptable level of credit risk  o effectively collect payments due on the contracts in our portfolio and portfolios we service for others  o locate sufficient financing  with acceptable terms  to fund and maintain our operations  and o adapt to the increasingly competitive market in which we operate 
our inability to achieve or maintain any or all of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our outstanding securities 
outside factors  such as the economic  regulatory  and judicial environments in which we operate  will also have an effect on our business 
our operations depend significantly on external financing 
we have borrowed  and will continue to borrow  substantial amounts to fund our operations 
our operations require large amounts of capital 
if we cannot obtain the financing we need on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our business will be adversely affected 
we currently obtain our financing through three primary sources o a revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation  o securitization transactions  and o loans from other sources 
each of these financing sources is described in detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
revolving credit facility with ge capital 
our revolving facility with ge capital is our primary source of operating capital 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to ge capital to secure the borrowings we make under this facility 
although this facility has a maximum commitment of million  the amount we can borrow is limited by the amount of certain types of assets that we own 
in addition  we cannot borrow approximately million of the capacity while our guarantee to the fmac contract purchaser is in effect 
as of december   we owed approximately million under the revolving facility  and had the ability to borrow an additional million 
the revolving facility expires in june even if we continue to satisfy the terms and conditions of the revolving facility  we may not be able to extend its term beyond the current expiration date 
securitization transactions 
we can restore capacity under the ge facility from time to time by securitizing portfolios of finance receivables 
our ability to successfully complete securitizations in the future may be affected by several factors  including o the condition of securities markets generally  o conditions in the asset backed securities markets specifically  o the credit quality of our loan contract portfolio  and o the performance of our servicing operations 
the securitization subsidiaries are wholly owned bankruptcy remote entities 
their assets  including the line items residuals in finance receivables sold and investments held in trust  which are a component of finance receivables on our balance sheet  are not available to satisfy the claims of our creditors 
on november   we announced that we were changing the way that we structure transactions under our securitization program 
in the past  we structured these transactions as sales for accounting purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  however  we began to structure securitizations for accounting purposes to retain the financed receivables and related debt on our balance sheet and recognize the income over the life of the contracts 
in the past  gain on sales of loans in securitization transactions has been material to our profitability 
this change will cause a material adverse effect on our reported earnings until the net interest earnings from new contracts added to our balance sheet approximates those net revenues that we historically recognized on our securitization sales 
contractual restrictions 
the revolving facility  the securitization program  and our other credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants that limit our operations 
under these credit facilities  we must also meet certain financial tests 
as of december   we did not satisfy the interest coverage ratio and cash flow based interest coverage ratio under the ge facility 
ge capital waived these defaults for this period 
at the present time  we believe that we are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the revolving facility and our other credit facilities 
failure to satisfy the covenants in our credit facilities and or our securitization program could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have a high risk of credit losses because of the poor creditworthiness of our borrowers 
substantially all of the sales financing that we extend and the contracts that we service are with sub prime borrowers 
sub prime borrowers generally cannot obtain credit from traditional financial institutions  such as banks  savings and loans  credit unions  or captive finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers  because of their poor credit histories and or low incomes 
we have established an allowance for credit losses approximating of contract principal balances as of december  to cover anticipated credit losses on the contracts currently in our portfolio 
further  the allowance for credit losses embedded in the residuals in finance receivables sold as a percentage of the remaining principal balances of the underlying contracts was approximately as of december  we believe that our current allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated credit losses 
there is  however  no assurance that we have adequately provided for  or will adequately provide for  such credit risks 
a significant variation in the timing of or increase in credit losses on our portfolio would have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we also operate our cygnet dealer program  under which we provide third party dealers who finance the sale of used cars to sub prime borrowers with warehouse purchase facilities and operating lines of credit primarily secured by those dealers retail installment contract portfolios and or inventory 
while we require third party dealers to meet certain minimum net worth and operating history criteria before we loan money to them  these dealers may not otherwise be able to obtain debt financing from traditional lending institutions 
like our other financing activities  these loans subject us to a high risk of credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to meet our other financing obligations 
we are affected by various industry considerations and legal contingencies 
in recent periods  several major used car finance companies have announced major downward adjustments to their financial statements  violations of loan covenants  related litigation  and other events 
companies in the used vehicle sales and financing market have also been named as defendants in an increasing number of class action lawsuits brought by customers claiming violations of various federal and state consumer credit and similar laws and regulations 
in addition  certain of these companies have filed for bankruptcy protection 
these events o have lowered the value of securities of sub prime automobile finance companies  o have made it more difficult for sub prime lenders to borrow money  and o could cause more restrictive regulation of this industry 
compliance with additional regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability 
interest rates affect our profitability 
a substantial portion of our financing income results from the difference between the rate of interest we pay on the funds we borrow and the rate of interest we earn on the contracts in our portfolio 
while we earn interest on the contracts we own at a fixed rate  we pay interest on our borrowings under our ge facility at a floating rate 
when interest rates increase  our interest expense increases and our net interest margins decrease 
increases in our interest expense that we cannot offset by increases in interest income will lower our profitability 
impact of laws limiting interest rates 
historically  we conducted a significant portion of our used car sales activities in  and a significant portion of the contracts we service were originated in states that did not impose limits on the interest rate that a lender may charge 
however  we have expanded  and will continue to expand  into states that impose interest rate limitations 
when a state limits the amount of interest we can charge on our installment sales contracts  we may not be able to offset any increased interest expense caused by rising interest rates or greater levels of borrowings under our credit facilities 
therefore  these interest rate limitations or additional laws  rules  or regulations that may be adopted in the future can adversely affect our profitability 
our business is subject to federal and state regulation  supervision  and licensing 
we are subject to ongoing regulation  supervision  and licensing under various federal  state  and local statutes  ordinances  and regulations 
among other things  these laws o require that we obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications  o limit or prescribe terms of the contracts that we originate and or purchase  o require specified disclosures to customers  o limit our right to repossess and sell collateral  and o prohibit us from discriminating against certain customers 
we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable material federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
we may not  however  be able to remain in compliance with such laws 
if we do not comply with these laws  we could be fined or certain of our operations could be interrupted or shut down 
failure to comply could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  the adoption of additional statutes and regulations  changes in the interpretation of existing statutes and regulations  or our entry into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory requirements could also have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are dependent on our data processing platforms and other technology 
our computer systems may be subject to a year date failure 
conversion of our data processing platforms 
we recently converted our chain of dealerships and related loan servicing data processing operations to a single computer system 
these conversions can cause various implementation and integration problems that can affect our servicing operations and result in increases in contract delinquencies and charge offs and decreases in our servicing income 
failure to successfully complete our conversions could materially affect our business and profitability 
year readiness 
we are continuing to study our computer systems to determine our exposure to year issues 
we expect to make the necessary modifications or changes to our computer systems to allow them to properly process transactions relating to the year and beyond 
we estimate that we will spend between million to million for year evaluation  remediation  testing  and replacement 
we have spent approximately million to date 
if we have to replace certain systems to make them year compliant  we will record the costs as assets and subsequently amortize them 
if we have to modify existing systems  we will expense the costs as incurred 
we can be adversely affected by year problems in the business systems of our suppliers  vendors  and business partners  such as utility suppliers  banking partners and telecommunication service providers 
we can also be adversely affected if year problems result in business disruptions or failures that impact our customers ability to make their loan payments 
failure to fully address and resolve these year issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year readiness disclosure 
our current contingency plan is being revised 
we depend on our loan servicing and collection facilities and on long distance and local telecommunications access to transmit and process information among our various facilities 
we use a standard program to prepare and store off site backup tapes of our main system applications and data files on a routine basis 
however  we believe that we need to revise our current contingency plan because of our recent system conversions and significant growth 
although we intend to update our contingency plan during  there could be a failure in the interim 
in addition  the plan as revised may not prevent a system failure or allow us to timely resolve any systems failure 
also  a natural disaster  calamity  or other significant event that causes long term damage to any of these facilities or that interrupts our telecommunications networks could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have certain risks relating to the fmac transaction 
we have entered into several transactions in the bankruptcy proceedings of first merchants acceptance corporation fmac 
we purchased of fmac s senior bank debt at a discount 
we agreed to pay the selling banks additional consideration up to the amount of this discount or approximately million if fmac makes cash payments or issues notes at market rates to its unsecured creditors and equity holders in excess of of their allowed claims against fmac 
fmac may make future cash payments to its unsecured creditors and equity holders from recoveries on the contracts which originally secured the senior bank debt and from certain residual interests in fmac s securitized loan pools  after fmac pays certain other amounts excess collections 
under fmac s plan of reorganization  we will split these excess collections with fmac 
if we satisfy certain requirements  we may be able to issue shares of our common stock in exchange for all or part of fmac s share of the excess collections 
this would reduce the cash distributions that could be made to fmac s unsecured creditors and or equity holders 
we would then be entitled to receive fmac s share of the excess collections 
the shares would be priced at of the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days prior to the date of issuance 
this market price must be at least per share or we cannot exercise this option 
even if we are able to issue common stock for this purpose o the number of shares that we issue may not be sufficient to prevent fmac from paying unsecured creditors and equity holders more than of their claims against fmac 
should this happen  we would be required to pay the selling banks additional consideration for our purchase of of fmac s senior bank debt  and o the issuance of shares would cause dilution to our common stock 
we also have other risks in the fmac bankruptcy case o we sold the contracts securing the bank claims at a profit to a third party purchaser the contract purchaser 
we guaranteed the contract purchaser a specified return on the contracts with a current maximum of million 
although we obtained a related guarantee from fmac secured by certain assets  there is no assurance that the fmac guarantee will cover all of our obligations under our guarantee to the contract purchaser  o we have made debtor in possession loans to fmac  secured by certain assets 
we have continuing obligations under our debtor in possession credit facility 
fmac is currently in default on the dip facility and we are negotiating a settlement with them that might increase our funding obligation in exchange for other concessions  o we entered into various agreements to service the contracts in the securitized pools of fmac and the contracts sold to the contract purchaser 
if we lose our right to service these contracts  our share of the excess collections can be reduced or eliminated 
each of the fmac risks described in this section could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if we make additional acquisitions  there is no assurance they will be successful 
in we completed three significant acquisitions seminole  e z plan  and kars 
we intend to consider additional acquisitions  alliances  and transactions involving other companies that could complement our existing business 
we may not  however  be able to identify suitable acquisition parties  joint venture candidates  or transaction counterparties 
additionally  even if we can identify suitable parties  we may not be able to consummate these transactions on terms that we find favorable 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate acquisitions  our operating expenses may increase in the short term 
this increase would affect our net earnings  which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition to the risks already mentioned  these transactions involve numerous other risks  including the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us 
our industry is highly competitive 
although a large number of smaller companies have historically operated in the used car sales industry  this industry has recently attracted significant attention from a number of large companies 
these large companies include autonation  usa  carmax  and driver s mart 
these companies have either entered the used car sales business or announced plans to develop large used car sales operations 
many franchised new car dealerships have also increased their focus on the used car market 
we believe that these companies are attracted by the relatively high gross margins that can be achieved in this market and the industry s lack of consolidation 
many of these companies and franchised dealers have significantly greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
among other things  increased competition could result in increased wholesale costs for used cars  decreased retail sales prices  and lower margins 
like the sale of used cars  the business of purchasing and servicing contracts originated from the sale of used cars to sub prime borrowers is highly fragmented and very competitive 
in recent years  several consumer finance companies have completed public offerings 
through these public offerings  these companies have been able to raise the capital necessary to fund expansion and support increased purchases of contracts 
these companies have increased the competition for the purchase of contracts  in many cases purchasing contracts at higher prices than we would be willing to pay 
there are numerous financial services companies serving  or capable of serving  our market 
these companies include traditional financial institutions such as banks  savings and loans  credit unions  and captive finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers  as well as other non traditional consumer finance companies  many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than our own 
increased competition may cause downward pressure on the interest rates that we charge 
this pressure could affect the interest rates we charge on contracts originated by our dealerships or cause us to reduce or eliminate the acquisition discount on the contracts we purchase from third party dealers 
either change could have a material adverse effect on the value of our securities 
the success of our operations depends on certain key personnel 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to attract new management when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not currently maintain any key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
we may be required to issue stock in the future that will dilute the value of our existing stock 
issuance of any or all of the following securities may dilute the value of the securities that our existing stockholders now hold o we have granted warrants to purchase a total of approximately million shares of our common stock to various parties with exercise prices ranging from to per share  o we may be required to issue additional warrants in the future in connection with both a completed and as yet unidentified transactions  and o we may issue common stock in the fmac transaction in exchange for fmac s portion of the excess collections 
a significant percentage of our stock is controlled by a principal stockholder 
mr 
ernest c 
garcia  ii  our chairman  chief executive officer  and principal stockholder  or his affiliates held approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  this percentage includes  shares held by the garcia family foundation  inc  an arizona non profit corporation  and  shares held by verde investments  inc  a real estate investment corporation controlled by mr 
garcia 
as a result  mr 
garcia has a significant influence upon our activities as well as on all matters requiring approval of our stockholders 
these matters include electing or removing members of our board of directors  engaging in transactions with affiliated entities  causing or restricting our sale or merger  and changing our dividend policy 
the interests of mr 
garcia may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
there is a potential anti takeover effect if we issue preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue blank check preferred stock 
our board of directors may fix or change from time to time the designation  number  voting powers  preferences  and rights of this stock 
such issuances could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us by reducing the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
although we have no present intention of issuing any shares of our authorized preferred stock  we may do so in the future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk on our financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
our earnings are substantially affected by our net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
increases in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on profitability 
our financial instruments consist primarily of fixed rate finance receivables  residual interests in pools of fixed rate finance receivables  short term variable rate revolving notes receivable  and variable and fixed rate notes payable 
our finance receivables are classified as subprime loans and generally bear interest at the lower of or the maximum interest rate allowed in states that impose interest rate limits 
at december   the scheduled maturities on our finance receivables range from one to months with a weighted average maturity of months 
the interest rates we charge our customers on finance receivables has not changed as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates  although we may increase the interest rates we charge in the future if market interest rates increase 
a large component of our debt at december  is the collateralized note payable class a certificates issued under our securitization program 
issuing debt through our securitization program allows us to mitigate our interest rate risk by reducing the balance of the variable revolving line of credit and replacing it with a lower fixed rate note payable 
we are subject to interest rate risk on fixed rate notes payable to the extent that future interest rates are higher than the interest rates on our existing notes payable 
the table below illustrates the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our earnings before income taxes over a twelve month period 
we compute the impact on earnings for the period by first computing the baseline net interest income on our financial instruments with interest rate risk  which are the variable rate revolving credit lines and the variable rate notes payable 
we then determine the net interest income based on each of the interest rate changes listed below and compare the results to the baseline net interest income to determine the estimated change in pretax earnings 
the table does not give effect to our fixed rate receivables and borrowings 
change in interest rates change in pretax earnings in thousands in computing the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates  we have assumed that o interest rates used for the baseline and hypothetical net interest income amounts are in effect for the entire twelve month period  o interest for the period is calculated on financial instruments held at december  less contractually scheduled payments and maturities  and o there is no change in prepayment rates as a result of the interest rate changes 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes could be significantly different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to compute the estimates
