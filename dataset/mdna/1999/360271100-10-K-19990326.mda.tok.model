results of operations overview the corporation continued to generate steady earnings growth in net income for the year was million or per diluted share 
this was an increase of million or over net income of million 
diluted net income per share increased over the realized in net income for was million or greater than  while diluted net income per share represented an increase of over in the recent earnings trend has been consistent over the past three years and is largely attributable to growth  a strong net interest margin  expense controls and good asset quality 
however  certain items that could be considered non recurring in each of the periods are notable 
the table below summarizes net income and adjusts for certain of these items to arrive at core or adjusted net income 
the adjustments shown reflect the after tax impact on net income 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income reported    investment securities gains    merger conversion expenses  saif charge  adjusted net income    increase over prior year adjusted net income per share diluted increase over prior year investment securities gains and merger expenses are shown as adjustments since many in the industry consider them to be non recurring items 
however  the corporation does have a history of both 
security gains are derived mainly from the corporation s investments in equities of other financial institutions 
gains are realized when  in the opinion of management  the investments have reached full valuation 
given the size of this portfolio million in market value with million in unrealized gains at december   it is probable that the corporation will continue to realize gains in future periods 
merger expenses represent professional fees paid to complete mergers 
with the corporation s external growth strategy  it is probable that similar expenses will be incurred in the future 
the saif charge in represents the corporation s share of the industry wide fdic assessment to recapitalize the underfunded savings association insurance fund 
after adjusting for these items  the corporation s net income still reflects steady growth over the past three years  with increases of in  in and in in  and  the corporation achieved returns on average assets of  and  respectively  and returns on average shareholders equity of  and 
excluding the effect of unrealized gains on securities  the corporation s return on average equity was in  in and in net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of net income 
the ability to manage net interest income over a variety of interest rate and economic environments is critical to the success of a banking entity 
net interest income growth is dependent upon the growth of the corporation s balance sheet and maintenance of yields on earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities 
see also the discussion of interest rate risk later in this section 
in the past year  the corporation experienced a decrease in loan growth as a result of slower economic growth and increased competition from banks and non banks alike 
while the recent competition for loans has increased  management has not sacrificed the corporation s credit standards in order to increase loan volume 
although this strategy may prevent additional loan losses in the future  it has had an impact on net interest income 
excess funds that would have been invested in new loans were placed in lower yielding assets such as investments 
this has caused downward pressure on the corporation s margin and has slowed net interest income growth 
net interest income for was million  a million or increase over this was a decline from the million or increase realized in furthermore  the corporation s net interest margin declined to in from in and in the comparative average balance sheets and net interest income analysis on page and the rate volume table on page summarize the components of net interest income and illustrate variances as a result of changes in interest rates versus growth in assets and liabilities 
v 
interest income increased million or from million in to million in of this increase  million was a result of a million or increase in average earning assets  offset by a million decrease due to a drop in the average yield from in to in average loans increased million or in additional increases were realized in investment securities  which increased million or from million in to billion in the basis point decline in the average yield was driven by two primary factors 
first  the average yield on loans decreased basis points to in from in secondly  the mix of interest earning assets changed from loans and investments in to loans and investments in lower yields on investments overall  in and in relative to loans and a higher percentage of investments in caused a further reduction in the overall yield 
the basis point reduction in loan yields is closely correlated with the nine basis point decrease in the corporation s average prime lending rate from to 
the prime rate is an indicator of the interest rate environment in general 
interest expense increased million or to million in from million in as with interest income  this increase was mainly volume driven million as average interest bearing liabilities increased million  offset by a million decrease due to a slight decline in rates from in to in average interest bearing deposits showed the largest increase  million or 
most of this increase was in time deposits  which increased million or 
long term debt  which consists mainly of advances from the federal home loan bank  increased million or 
the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased only four basis points  despite the general fall in rates throughout the industry 
this was mainly due to the fact many of the corporation s deposits in were in certificates of deposit which had not yet realized the impact of rate reductions 
this is shown by the average cost of cd s remaining fairly constant at in comparison to in this was somewhat offset by non interest bearing demand deposits which outpaced time deposits in percentage increase vs 
and provide a no cost funding source which strengthens the overall net interest margin 
with interest rates relatively low  the corporation also turned to borrowings as an alternative funding source 
in an effort to reduce rate sensitivity  the corporation locked in longer term borrowings with the fhlb 
the average cost of such borrowings in was approximately as compared to in in general  the cost of these funds has been less than comparable term certificates of deposit 
v 
interest income increased million or from million in to million in this increase was mainly due to balance sheet growth 
average earning assets increased million or to billion  almost entirely as a result of strong loan growth during million or 
investments remained fairly stable as loan demand consumed all of the additional funds provided during the period 
the average yield on earning assets increased slightly to in from in the average prime lending rate in was as compared to in the yield on the corporation s loan portfolio  however  was not reflective of this rate environment as average loan yields actually decreased five basis points 
this situation was due to two main factors a competitive pressures  and b a change in the mix of the corporation s loan portfolio to a larger percentage of fixed rate loans  which are less sensitive to short term rate fluctuations 
offsetting the decline in loan yields was an increase in yields on investments 
this occurred as the corporation s investment strategy shifted from us treasury and agency issues to mortgage backed securities 
maturing funds were invested more heavily in mortgage backed securities which generally achieve a higher return with only moderate increases in credit risk 
interest expense increased million or to million in from million in as with interest income  this increase was mainly volume driven as average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or 
unlike  which saw increases in all deposit types  the increase was realized entirely in time deposits million or 
the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points  mainly as a result of time deposits  which realized an increase in cost as the corporation focused on this funding source to support loan growth 
provision and allowance for loan losses additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to income through the provision for loan losses when  in the opinion of management and based on continuing analyses of the loan portfolio  it is believed that the allowance is not adequate 
management considers various factors in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determining the provision for the period 
among these are charge off history and trends  risk classification of significant credits  adequacy of collateral  the mix and risk characteristics of loan types in the portfolio  and the balance of the allowance relative to total and nonperforming loans 
additional consideration is given to local and national economic conditions 
the corporation s policy is individually applied to each of the eleven affiliate banks 
resulting provisions and allowances are aggregated for consolidated financial reporting 
the tables below summarize non performing assets and net charge offs by major loan category as of or for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands 
nonperforming assets amount of total amount of total amount of total real estate loans    commercial industrial loans    consumer loans    other real estate owned    total    non performing assets total assets 
non performing loans total loans 
net charge offs amount change amount change amount change real estate loans na commercial industrial loans  consumer loans    total    net charge offs average loans the provision for loan losses for totaled million  compared to the and provisions of million and million  respectively 
the total provision for was comparable to the level of net charge offs for the year  million or of average loans outstanding 
the million or decrease in the provision in was a result of two situations 
first of all  the overall credit quality of the corporation s portfolio showed improvement over  as reflected by nonperforming assets to total assets of in and nonperforming loans to total loans of in 
secondly  loans increased only in as compared to in  reducing the need for a general provision for new loan volume 
despite the improvements in asset quality  a provision was considered necessary in as a result of changes in the mix of the corporation s nonperforming assets and charge offs 
in recent years  the corporation has expanded its indirect automobile lending 
while this has contributed to balance sheet and interest income growth  these loans generally have higher losses 
in  total consumer charge offs which include indirect loans  increased  or over and accounted for over of the corporation s net charge offs 
while loan growth in slowed  based on charge off and delinquency history  it is probable that additional losses exist in this portfolio 
the provision for loan losses increased million or to million in as compared to million in this increase was a result of several negative factors during the period 
first of all  nonperforming assets to total assets increased to as compared to in and nonperforming loans to total loans increased to as compared to in secondly  losses on consumer lending increased million or 
finally  loan growth in was strong  particularly in consumer lending  meaning new loans with higher inherent risk were being added to the corporation s portfolio 
based on these factors  management considered additional provisions to be appropriate 
the corporation s allowance methodology resulted in of the total balance being allocated to specific loans and loan types at december  as compared to at december  these allocations were based upon the review and classification of specific large credits as fair  substandard  doubtful and loss and applying reserve percentages that are estimates of probable loss incurred based on the above noted factors 
currently  and for the noted categories 
in addition  portfolios with large numbers of smaller balance accounts consumer and residential mortgages are classified based on loss history and other factors which estimate the loss levels inherent in the portfolios 
in management s opinion  based on its allowance methodology and its consideration of the noted factors  the allowance for loan losses of million at december  is adequate 
other income noninterest income was million for this represented an increase of million or over the total of million  which  in turn  was higher than the total of million 
excluding investment securities gains  the increase was million or in and million or in every category of noninterest income increased during and  mainly as a result of growth and the introduction of new products  services and charges 
investment management and trust services income reached a record level of million in  an increase of million or  following a increase of million or 
the growth during and was due to increased marketing of traditional trust  retirement and investment services as well as the continued success of several new investment management programs 
the customized cash reserve investment management crim product continued to grow as an important vehicle for companies  municipalities  and not for profit institutions looking to enhance the return on their short term invested funds 
in late  the corporation added investment and brokerage services 
registered brokerage representatives are being introduced available throughout the corporation s branch network to assist customers with mutual funds and annuities and to offer discount brokerage services 
this business has exceeded the corporation s expectations and is well positioned for growth in the future 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million or during  after increasing million or in these increases were a result of the growth in the average balance of fee based demand and savings deposits  which increased in and in in addition  over the past three years the corporation has modified the fee structures at certain affiliate banks and introduced certain additional fees  such as foreign atm fees 
the corporation uses a product review and development process through which all products and services provided by the corporation s subsidiary banks are reviewed on a rotating basis 
this review allows the corporation to formally assess product features and pricing in comparison to its competitors 
other service charges and fees increased million or during and  or in the most significant component of these increases was the introduction of atm surcharges in september  these charges totaled million in and  in also included in other service charges and fees for were gains on sales of fixed assets of approximately gains on sales of mortgage loans increased million or to million in after remaining stable from to this was a result of the decline in residential mortgage loan rates during and the resulting level of refinance activity 
the corporation sells substantially all fixed rate conforming loans in the secondary market and generally retains the servicing rights on such loans 
this practice reduces the corporation s interest rate risk and provides additional liquidity 
in addition  the corporation generates servicing income on such sold loans 
servicing income  which is included in other service charges and fees  increased  or during investment securities gains increased million or to million in in  such gains increased million or 
the majority of the gains realized during and were generated from the sale of equity securities 
as previously discussed  management monitors the corporation s available for sale securities and makes periodic sale and investment decisions based on its assessment of the investments values 
the increase in was due to the strong performance of the corporation s equity portfolio 
other expenses noninterest expenses for increased million or to million  from the total of million  after increasing million or during excluding the one time saif charge of million recorded in 
the corporation s efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expenses to fully taxable equivalent revenues excluding investment securities gains  improved to in from in and in excluding saif 
salaries and employee benefits expense  which accounts for the largest portion of other expenses  increased million or to million during  as compared to an increase of million or in the salary portion of the increase in was million or 
the corporation experienced an increase in average full time equivalent employees fte s from  in to  in this increase resulted from the mergers with keystone heritage and ambassador as excess employees were gradually absorbed into the corporation and from the expansion of the corporation s products and services 
these additional employees added approximately  in salary expense during the year 
excluding these additions  salary expense increased due to normal merit increases and promotions 
the salaries component of the increase was approximately million or 
the average number of fte s during the period increased to  in from  in  contributing approximately  to expense 
this increase in fte s was attributable to growth 
excluding these additional employees  salaries expense increased approximately employee benefits increased  or in and million or in most of the increases in both years were due to normal increases in the cost of health insurance and additional retirement plan expense due to the increase in the number of employees 
in addition   was accrued for certain post employment benefits in despite the increases in salaries and benefits expenses  the corporation has seen improvement in salaries and benefits expense measures 
the salaries and benefits efficiency ratio was in  which was an improvement over in and in net occupancy expense decreased  or during  compared to an increase of million or in equipment expense decreased  or in  after increasing million or in the decreases were due to the consolidation and divesting of certain branches acquired in the lebanon valley merger as well as the disposal of certain equipment previously used by lebanon valley for its in house data processing function 
the corporation continues to make strategic investments in its branch network and technology 
the costs of such investments in were offset by the savings noted above 
investments in technology have been carefully balanced with the corporation s commitment to its branch network  which continues to be the customers preferred delivery channel in the corporation s markets 
the corporation will continue to face the challenge of developing and offering modern conveniences to customers while maintaining its community and branch banking focus 
in  the corporation began offering pc banking as an alternative approach for its customers to complete certain banking transactions 
fdic assessment expense remained relatively constant from to as no significant changes in the assessment rate structure occurred 
the expense was million or lower than due to the one time saif assessment of million recorded in special services expense  which represents the cost of outside data processing  increased million or to million during after increasing only  or in the corporation has a contract with a third party to perform the main data processing functions for all of the corporation s affiliate banks 
the increase in was primarily a result of the conversion of lebanon valley national bank from an in house system to the corporation s third party data processor  with offsetting savings being realized in occupancy and equipment expenses 
the corporation has also incurred additional cost as a result of conversion to a new mortgage processing system and a new trust system 
other expenses increased million or to million during after decreasing  or during the increase included an additional  in operating risk losses  which are losses incurred in the normal course of banking business due to forgeries  robberies and fraud 
stationary and supplies expense increased  or as a result of converting lebanon valley and ambassador 
telephone expense increased  or with the expansion of the corporation s data communications network 
merger related expenses increased  or as a result of the two acquisitions completed during the decrease in was due mainly to fewer operating risk losses decrease of  or and a decrease in the cost of the corporate owned life insurance plan due to a change in the underlying contracts decrease in expense of  or 
these decreases were offset by other expense increases incurred as a result of growth 
income taxes income tax expense continued to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of pretax income 
the effective tax rate was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the corporation s variances from the federal statutory rate of are generally due to tax exempt income  investments in low and moderate income housing partnerships which qualify for federal tax credits  and certain merger related expenses which are not deductible 
although the corporation s tax free investments increased in  the effect was more than offset by the additional merger expenses incurred 
net credits in low income housing partnerships were million in  million in and million in fulton financial corporation and subsidiaries average consolidated balance sheets december monthly averages assets in thousands cash and due from banks    interest bearing deposits with other banks    federal funds sold   investment securities    loans  including loans held for sale    less allowance for loan losses    net loans    premises and equipment    other assets    total assets    liabilities and shareholders equity deposits noninterest bearing    interest bearing    total deposits    short term borrowings    long term debt    other liabilities    total liabilities    total shareholders equity    total liabilities and shareholders equity    financial condition the corporation functions as a financial intermediary and its financial condition is analyzed in terms of its sources and uses of funds 
the table above highlights the trends in the balance sheet over the past two years 
because annual averages tend to conceal trends and ending balances can be distorted by one day fluctuations  the december monthly averages for each of the last three years are provided to give a better indication of trends in the balance sheet 
all references within the discussion that follows are to these december average balances unless specifically noted otherwise 
the corporation s assets continued to grow during  reaching billion  an increase of million or as compared to the increase was due to increases in funds through deposits and long term borrowings 
as discussed in the net interest income section  these funds were invested primarily in investment securities as loan demand slowed during the year 
total assets in were million or higher than unlike  the increase was generally a result of strong loan demand 
loans loans outstanding net of unearned income increased million or for  compared to a increase of million or 
although loan growth slowed in  the corporation was able to grow its commercial mortgage portfolio by million or 
this growth was attained by leveraging new markets 
as a result of the low interest rate environment  most borrowers opted for fixed rate loans 
this was reflected in fixed rate commercial mortgages  which accounted for million of the total increase 
almost all other categories of loans reflected lower demand in consumer loans  consisting of automobile financing  student loans  credit cards and home equity lines of credit  increased only million or 
commercial loans decreased million or 
residential mortgages decreased million or 
the run off of the residential mortgage loan portfolio occurred because of the low interest rate environment 
existing borrowers  primarily those with adjustable rate loans  refinanced to lower fixed rate loans 
the corporation s policy is to sell all fixed rate loans in the secondary market and  generally  retain the servicing rights 
the volume of refinance activity is evident in the amount of loans sold in the secondary market during  million as compared to million in mortgage loans held for sale increased million from to million at december  this increase also reflects the higher level of refinance activity during the loan growth in was realized mainly in commercial loans million or increase and consumer loans million or increase 
commercial mortgages also increased moderately  showing growth of million or investment securities in  excess funds were used to purchase investment securities 
investment securities increased million or in in a continuation of a trend noted in prior years  the corporation invested new funds primarily in mortgage backed securities mbs to earn a higher yield than us treasury and agency securities 
mbs investments increased million or in the corporation s mbs investments do not include subordinated or residual cash flows or other higher risk features 
the corporation also began investing in tax free state and municipal bonds as the fully taxable equivalent yields became more favorable in comparison to similar taxable issues 
tax free investments increased million or in increasing these investments created more diversification in the investment portfolio 
the corporation continues to manage a portfolio of equity investments which consists of federal home loan bank and other government agency stock million and stock of other financial institutions million cost and million market value at december  
management periodically sells bank stocks when the valuation and market conditions warrant such sales 
in  the corporation continued to classify the majority of its new investment purchases as available for sale afs in order to manage the corporation s liquidity position 
as of december   billion or of the corporation s investment portfolio was classified as available for sale an increase of million or over  while only million or was classified as held to maturity htm a decrease of million or from 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that all investment securities be classified as either i held to maturity  ii available for sale  or iii a trading security 
the corporation possesses both the intent  subject to credit impairment  and ability to hold debt securities classified as htm to maturity 
other assets total other assets increased million or from december  to december  the majority of this increase was due to the payoff of the million loan on the corporation s corporate owned life insurance coli plan 
this loan  which was recorded as an offset to the accumulated cash surrender value on the coli plan  was paid off since recent changes in the tax laws reduced the benefits of leveraged coli plans 
additional increases included million in the net deferred tax asset as the deferred tax liability on available for sale investment securities was reduced to reflect the lower unrealized gains 
during  the corporation continued its participation in affordable housing and community development projects through investments in partnerships 
equity commitments totaling million were made to three new projects 
the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in projects  all located in the various communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of such investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low income individuals in its service area in support of its subsidiary bank s community reinvestment act compliance effort  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some instances  state programs 
deposits and borrowings the corporation has historically been able to rely on deposit growth as a relatively low cost funding source for loans 
in recent years  increased competition from other financial services providers has made attracting deposits more difficult 
in  deposits grew million or to billion 
this growth was realized mainly in demand and savings deposits  which increased million or  offset by reductions in time deposits of million or 
while overall growth was difficult  the corporation did benefit from positive gains in non interest bearing deposits  which increased million or 
during  the corporation took advantage of lower rates to lock in long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
long term debt increased million or over these borrowings were generally used to fund new loans and improve the corporation s interest rate gap position see market risk  while additional funds from loan payoffs and deposit growth were generally used to purchase investment securities 
in  the corporation experienced stronger loan growth 
long term debt was not as attractive as a funding source  so the corporation focused on time deposits to generate necessary funds 
time deposits increased million or in  compared to demand and savings deposits  which increased million or 
shareholders equity shareholders equity continued to be an important funding source  with a balance of million  an increase of million or from million in in spite of increasing dividends  the corporation maintained a strong rate of internal capital generation net income less dividends paid divided by beginning equity 
this internal capital growth was in and growth in capital is dependent upon strong earnings and a prudent dividend policy  represented by payout ratios of for and for the increase in dividend payout in was due to the two companies acquired in having lower payout ratios historically 
in restating historical financial statements  the prior period was reduced 
in april   the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of the corporation s common stock through october  this plan was later extended through march  treasury stock acquired under this plan is used for the corporation s employee stock purchase plan  incentive stock option plan and other benefit plans 
through december    shares had been repurchased under the plan 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations 
the corporation s total and tier i risk based capital ratios have generally placed the corporation near the middle of its self defined peer group over the past year 
the corporation s ratio of tier capital to average assets  however  has generally placed it in the top quartile in comparison to its peers 
year the corporation s business  operations and financial condition may be affected by the year problem where certain computer and other electronic information processing systems may not be able to properly recognize dates after a financial institution s ability to process financial data such as deposits  loans and trust accounts through its various data processing systems is the most obvious area of exposure to the year problem 
in addition  a financial institution s ability to collect payments on loans could be impacted if borrowers are unable to make payments as a result of their own year deficiencies 
furthermore  financial institutions could be affected by the year readiness of business customers  vendors and correspondents  customer perception of the problem  and regulatory influences  among other things 
the corporation has formed committees at each subsidiary bank and at the corporation to identify  evaluate and manage the risks related to the year problem 
a comprehensive plan adopted by the board of directors of the corporation establishes a five step process awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation to address the year problem 
the plan establishes priorities for addressing the year problem  with systems classified as being most mission critical receiving the highest priority treatment 
the primary focus of the plan is on assuring that information technology systems will be operable  but it also addresses non information technology issues such as embedded technology in security and other systems 
the awareness and assessment phases of the plan have been completed 
the renovation of all mission critical systems  including third party systems  is substantially complete 
the corporation is currently in the validation and implementation phases for its mission critical systems  which will be substantially complete by june  the corporation is also in the process of completing business contingency plans for all critical processes within the organization 
these plans will be substantially complete by june  during the last half of  the corporation will re inspect all processes  beginning with the most critical  for continual assurance that contingency planning adequately addresses potential disruptions 
federal bank regulatory agencies have issued year project guidelines for financial institutions from time to time and have also conducted examinations of the corporation and its banks on the corporation s plans to address the year problem 
the corporation has used such guidance to establish year work tasks for each phase 
through december  the corporation has incurred approximately million in expenses related to the year in addition  capital expenditures to replace non compliant hardware  software and other equipment have totaled approximately million 
through  the corporation anticipates incurring an additional million in expenses and million in capital expenditures 
while these costs are related to the year problem  many also represent significant improvements to the technology infrastructure for fulton financial corporation and its bank subsidiaries 
improvements at fulton bank include migrating to a new branch automation solution and new data processing solutions for the bank s investment management and trust services department and leasing department 
at hagerstown trust company  they include a new personal computing and local area network solution and changing the check processing solution to the same system used at all other subsidiary banks 
across the entire corporation  local area networks have been upgraded as required and the first phase for a wide area telecommunications network has been installed to support the investment management and trust services data processing system and the branch automation system 
each subsidiary bank also has upgraded their telephone systems  including the automated voice response systems  as needed 
since third party service providers perform most major data processing functions of the corporation  the corporation does not anticipate that it will incur any material costs to address the year problem other than those discussed above 
the corporation expects  at this time  that the year problem should have no material adverse effect on the products and services it offers or on competitive conditions  however  further testing with mission critical third party service providers will be necessary to validate the readiness of these providers for this change 
similarly  the corporation believes that the year problem should have no material adverse effect on the corporation s business  operations or financial condition  based on up surveys of its major business loan customers and other actions designed to evaluate the risks associated with the year problem  however  it cannot rule out the possibility that the year problem might have such an effect 
the corporation will continue to evaluate such risks throughout federal bank regulators have initiated a series of examinations of all financial institutions to assess their progress in addressing the year problem and have indicated that institutions which have not adequately addressed the issue will be subject to various sanctions  including denial of  or delay in acting on  regulatory applications 
the corporation believes that it has made sufficient progress on the year problem to minimize the likelihood of regulatory sanctions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions cost basis of approximately million and us government and agency stock cost basis of approximately million 
the corporation s equity investments had a total estimated fair value of million at december  the million unrealized gain is primarily attributable to the financial institutions stock 
although the book value of equity investments accounted for only of the corporation s total assets  the unrealized gains on the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of periodically realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue source could be lost 
the corporation manages its equity market price risk by investing only in regional financial institutions 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided here since none of them have maturity dates 
interest rate risk interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first of all  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
secondly  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion or of total assets 
this represents an increase from the december  total of million or of total assets 
liquidity is also provided by non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due from one to five years  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
principal payments received on the held to maturity mortgage backed securities portfolio also provide liquidity 
the corporation had million of such mortgage backed securities at december  and million at december  the loan portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity due to the corporation s ability to participate in the secondary mortgage market 
sales of residential mortgages into the secondary market of million and million in and  respectively  provided the necessary funding which allowed the corporation to meet the needs of its customers for new mortgage financing 
from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on the steady growth of this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb  which provides them access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional million of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
the following table provides information about the corporation s interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
the table provides expected cash flows and weighted average rates for each significant interest rate sensitive financial instrument  by expected maturity period

the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected contractual cash flows from financial instruments 
expected contractual maturities  however  do not necessarily estimate the net income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from contractual cash flows 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rate relationships 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into predetermined repricing periods 
the assets and liabilities in each of these periods are summed and compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having noncontractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans held and for mortgage backed securities includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative month gap to plus or minus percent of total earning assets 
the cumulative month gap as of december  was 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  daily adjustable days days days gap cumulative gap simulation of net interest income and of net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios is used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve based upon changes in the prime rate 
at december  the corporation had a larger exposure to upward rate shocks  with net interest income at risk of loss over the next twelve months of  and where interest rates are shocked upward by  and basis points  respectively 
economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as of december   upward shocks of  and basis points were estimated to have negative effects upon economic value of  and  respectively
