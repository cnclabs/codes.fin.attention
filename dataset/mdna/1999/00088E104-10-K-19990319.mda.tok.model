item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company to the extent that the information presented in this form k discusses financial projections  information or expectations about our products or markets  or otherwise makes statements about future events  such statements are forward looking and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these include  among others  the successful and timely development and acceptance of new products and markets and the availability of sufficient funding to effect such product and or market development 
since its inception  we have incurred operating losses approximating million related directly to the development and marketing of individualized television and hypertv tm 
we are seeking to exploit the entertainment market for individualized television programming  principally in the us  through our planned regional networks 
programming for the regional networks is provided through our strategic alliance with fox sports net 
the contribution of fox sports net s programming rights  production elements for each sporting event  and brand name is extremely valuable to us  since the cost for us to secure the rights to and produce such events  as well as build a brand identity on our own  would be prohibitive 
our obligation is to pay fox sports net a percentage of our net subscriber revenue we receive from cable operators 
in addition  we must bear the production cost of all extra or new elements  like an extra camera to focus on a particular star  that are used in our programming 
we must also build and maintain the production facility where we produce our enhanced programming 
we have entered into an agreement with tci to distribute and market our first regional network to tci s digital subscribers in texas 
the agreement also contemplates potential nationwide distribution by tci of our regional sports networks 
tci is the largest distributor of fox sports southwest programming  representing of the market 
in addition  tci is prioritizing texas for the roll out of digital set top boxes 
tci takes a percentage of revenue from the fees paid by subscribers to our network and remits the balance to us 
we plan to launch our first regional network in the southwestern united states during our projection  based on assumptions that could prove to be incorrect  is that this network will break even after two full years of operation 
even if we achieve this break even goal for our first region  given our plan to launch similar networks in many other regions  it is highly unlikely that we will be profitable for the foreseeable future 
to date  nearly all of our revenues have been derived from sales to the education market 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete in this market  where many of our current and potential competitors are companies with significantly greater resources than we do 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  during the year ended december   our revenues decreased  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of our product shift toward online learning software and services in and away from video programming and related equipment 
all of our revenues during were derived from the online learning market  compared to only of revenues 
cost of sales decreased in  to  from  in  and cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue decreased to in the more recent year  from in the relatively lower cost of sales in was due to eschool s higher gross margins than those of video programming and related equipment  which represented the majority of revenues in total expenses excluding cost of sales  net interest expense  and minority interest subsidiary preferred stock dividends and accretion in increased  to  from  in the comparable period in the increase was attributable to a number of factors  including a large change in stock appreciation rights expense due a higher common stock price at december   a rise in both operating and selling and administrative expenses principally from increased activity of our texas based regional network operation  and to higher depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased  to  from  for this increase was due principally to depreciation for the full year in of television production equipment installed in our texas subsidiary s facility  compared to several months during  and to greater amortization of software development costs in the more recent year 
we incurred interest expense of  for  compared to no interest expense for interest expense is related to a million face value note issued by a subsidiary actv  inc in january interest income for increased  to  compared with  in the increase resulted from higher available average cash balances in the more recent year 
for and  we recorded  and  respectively  for dividends and accretion on subsidiary convertible preferred stock issuances  which were accounted for as minority interest 
all dividend payments were made in common stock 
the increase during is the result principally of our redemption in full of the subsidiary convertible preferred stock 
for the year ended december   our net loss applicable to common shareholders was  or 
per basic and diluted share  an increase of over the net loss of  or 
per basic and diluted share  incurred in the increase in net loss was due both to higher operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  as well as an increase in charges from stock appreciation rights and subsidiary preferred stock dividends  accretion and redemption 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  during the year ended december   our revenues increased  to  from  for the year ended december  all revenues during were derived from the education market  while in  our revenues derived from education sales as well as from license and executive producer fees 
the revenue increase in the more recent period was the result of the inclusion of sales from eschool  which was introduced during fiscal  and higher sales of distance learning products and services when compared to cost of sales decreased in  to   from  in fiscal  and cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue decreased to in the more recent year  from in the relatively lower cost of sales in was due to a greater proportion of educational programming revenues and the inclusion of eschool sales in both eschool and educational programming have higher gross margins than our other sources of revenue 
total expenses excluding cost of sales  interest expense  and minority interest subsidiary preferred stock dividends and accretion in decreased  to  from  in the comparable period in the decrease was partially attributable to lower operating expenses and depreciation and amortization expense in the more recent period  which more than offset an increase in selling and administrative expense 
also  we recorded a gain of  in  compared to an expense of  related to stock appreciation rights 
the difference was the result of a lower market price for our common stock at the end of  when compared to the end of finally  during fiscal we incurred a valuation allowance of  related to an investment in an affiliated company and  as a component of fiscal selling and administrative expense  reserved  against license fee and production service receivables from this affiliate 
during  we incurred no valuation allowance 
for  direct expenses related to the entertainment and education markets were approximately million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense for decreased  to  from  for this decrease was due primarily to the recognition during of amortization expense for programming assets that were fully amortized during that year 
we had no interest expense for either or interest income for decreased  to  compared with  in the decrease resulted from lower available average cash balances in the more recent year 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  for dividends and accretion on subsidiary convertible preferred stock issuances  which were accounted for as minority interest 
all dividend payments were made in our common stock 
the increase during is the result of our having subsidiary convertible preferred stock outstanding for less than half of the year during for year ended december   our net loss was  or 
per basic and diluted share  an increase of less than over the net loss of  or 
per basic and diluted share  incurred in the decrease in net loss was due principally to higher gross margins  lower operating expenses  and lower depreciation and amortization and stock appreciation rights expenses during the more recent year 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  actv  inc including its operating subsidiaries has not generated revenues sufficient to fund its operations  and has incurred operating losses 
through december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our cash position on december   was  compared to  on december  during the year ended december   we used  in cash for our operations  compared with  for the year ended december  the increase in the more recent year was due to both a higher operating deficit in the more recent year  as well as a net use of cash related to asset and liability changes 
we met our cash needs in the year ended december  from sales of common stock totaling approximately to private investors  including million invested by liberty media corporation 
liberty also received an option to invest an additional million for the same price per share 
we met our cash needs in the year ended december  from the proceeds of a series of private placements during of common stock totaling million  convertible preferred stock totaling million  and from the remainder of funds received from the sale in of exchangeable preferred stock issued by a wholly owned subsidiary totaling million 
with respect to investing activities in the year ended december   we used cash of  for patents  property and equipment  and systems and software development 
during the year ended december   we used cash of  related principally to the development of hypertv tm  the purchase of equipment for a television master control facility in dallas  texas and for the systems development related to the incorporation of individualized programming into the gi cable set top terminal 
all of actv  inc s subsidiaries have been dependent on advances from the parent company to meet their obligations 
actv  inc s  the texas individualized television network  inc  in january raised funds directly for its operations and also received funding from actv  inc during during the year ended december   actv  inc advanced approximately million to hypertv networks  inc  million to the texas individualized television network  inc  and  to actv entertainment  inc 
advances are based upon budgeted expenses and revenues for each respective subsidiary 
adjustments are made during the course of the year based upon the subsidiary s performance versus the projections made in the budget 
as compared to our balance sheet as of december   our balance sheet as of december   reflects a decrease of  in preferred dividends payable  resulting principally from the redemption in late of convertible preferred stock of issued by a subsidiary of actv  inc in january  the actv  inc subsidiaries actv entertainment  inc 
and the texas individualized television network  inc entered into a note purchase agreement  dated as of january  with certain private investors 
pursuant to the agreement  the investors purchased million aggregate principal amount notes from our subsidiaries 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually  with principal repayment in one installment on june  during the term of the note  we may  at our option  pay any four semi annual interest payments in kind rather than in cash  with an increase in the rate applicable to such payments in kind to per annum 
we have chosen to make the first two semi annual interest payments june  and december  in kind 
the note is secured by the assets of the texas network  and is guaranteed by actv  inc in connection with the purchase of such note  the investors received on january  a common stock purchase warrant of texas network that granted the investors the either the right to purchase up to of the fully diluted shares of common stock of texas network or  through july   to exchange the warrant for such number of shares of our common stock  at the time of and giving effect to such exchange  that were equal to of the fully diluted number of shares of common stock outstanding 
in january  the investors exchanged the warrant in full into shares of our common stock 
for accounting purposes  the company has allocated approximately million to the value of the warrant  based on the market value of actv  inc common stock into which the warrant was convertible at issuance 
the warrant is included outside of consolidated shareholders equity deficiency due to its cash put feature and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the note 
in the first three months of  we have raised approximately  from the exercise of options and warrants 
we believe that we have adequate funding to launch the southwest regional network in and to fund our present operations for the next month period  assuming that we are able to raise approximately million from forcing the exercise of approximately million warrants 
we can effectively force such warrant exercise if the average closing price of our common stock is above per share for a twenty consecutive trading day period and the shares to be issued pursuant to the warrants are registered for sale by the sec 
currently  the share price requirement has been met and we have filed a registration statement for registration of the warrant shares 
approval by the sec is still pending 
should we raise such funds from warrant exercises  we will still need additional funding to operate the southwest regional network at planned levels  to fund the commercialization of hypertv tm for entertainment applications  and to fund our other operations prior to breakeven 
we will need additional funding as well to launch networks in other regions 
we currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will secure the funding necessary to effect additional launches in other regions  or that other factors might not delay or prohibit the successful implementation of the our regional network strategy or for the planned commercialization of hypertv tm for entertainment applications 
if we are not successful at raising additional funds  we may be required to significantly reduce our overall level of operations 
we do not have any material contractual commitments for capital expenditures  although we believe that we may need to acquire computers and network equipment of  to build our planned first hypertv tm server farm as well as for digital television and production equipment of approximately year compliance the year issue is the result of computer software that was written with only two digits rather than four digits to represent the year in a date field 
computer hardware and software applications that are date sensitive may interpret a date represented as to be the year rather than the year the result could be system failure or miscalculations causing the disruption of operations 
we believe that our internal systems  relating to both computer hardware and software  will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
in addition  we believe that our proprietary software either sold directly to third parties or incorporated in products sold to third parties is year compliant 
having performed an assessment of the potential year problem  we do not expect to incur significant costs related to year issues 
however  there is general uncertainty regarding the year problem and its effect on the overall business environment 
we cannot determine at this time whether the year problem will have a material impact on our operations or financial condition as the result of significant disruptions to the us economy and or business infrastructure 
impact of inflation inflation has not had any significant effect on our operating costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
the statement requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no
