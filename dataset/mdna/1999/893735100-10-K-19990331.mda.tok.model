item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in  transkaryotic therapies  inc the company has been primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of products based on the company s three proprietary development platforms gene activated proteins  niche protein products and gene therapy 
no revenues have been derived from the sale of any products  and the company does not expect to receive revenues from product sales until at least the company expects that its research and development expenditures will increase substantially in future years as product development efforts accelerate 
with the exception of  the company has incurred substantial annual operating losses since inception and expects to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was  as a result  the company is dependent upon existing cash resources  interest income  external financing from equity offerings  debt financings or collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance its operations 
results of operations may vary significantly from period to period depending on  among other factors  the progress of the company s research and development efforts  the receipt  if any  of additional license fees and milestone payments  the timing of certain expenses  and the establishment of additional collaborative research agreements 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
results of operations years ended december   and license and research revenues totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
with the exception of a  non refundable upfront payment from sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
relating to the development and commercialization of the company s fabry disease product in japan and other asian countries in  all other revenues in each fiscal year were earned from two collaborative agreements with hoechst marion roussel  inc hmri 
research and development expenses totaled  in  as compared to  in and  in the increase in of  or  was principally due to increases in external development services  research and development staffing and laboratory supplies in each of the company s product development platforms 
in particular  preclinical and clinical costs for the company s fabry disease and hemophilia a programs  as well as manufacturing costs associated with the fabry disease program  were significant components of the increase 
during  the costs related to both preclinical and clinical programs are expected to increase significantly as product development activities are initiated or expanded 
the increase in of  or  was principally due to an increase in external development costs  research and development staffing and laboratory supplies and expenses related thereto in each of the company s product development platforms 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in of  or  was principally due to increases in the number of administrative staff 
the increase in of  or  was principally due to increases in administrative employee costs and expenses associated with being a publicly held company 
during  general and administrative costs are expected to increase significantly as the company begins to build sales  marketing and distribution capabilities related to the commercialization of products in its niche protein product platform 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average cash and marketable securities balances were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increases in interest income in and resulted generally from higher average balances in each of the years 
higher average balances in the respective years resulted from the company s initial public offering in october and a follow on offering in july in  the effect of the increase in average balances on interest income was offset by a decline in yield 
in the current interest rate environment  the company anticipates yields from cash and marketable securities will decline significantly from amounts earned in and the company had a net loss of   and  in  and  respectively 
liquidity and sources of capital since its inception  the company has financed its operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  borrowings under debt agreements  revenues from collaborative agreements and interest income 
the company had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  at december  cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in us treasury notes  agencies of the us government and money market funds 
in july  the company completed a direct placement of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of  the company leased additional facilities in the fourth quarter of which will be used for research and development 
equipment and improvements to the space are estimated to cost approximately  in december  the company obtained an unsecured term loan facility for up to  to finance the capital costs related to the leased space 
the loan is payable beginning in december on the basis of a seven year amortization schedule over a five year period  with a final payment for any remaining amount in september the note contains certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  minimum cash and tangible net asset requirements and limitations on the payment of dividends 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under this facility 
even after lease of the new space referred to in the prior paragraph  the company s facilities may not be adequate to accommodate the company s needs beyond the company currently expects to meet any additional facilities requirements through development of a new facility or conversion of an existing building 
the company intends to seek financing for all or a significant portion of the cost of any additional facilities 
there can be no guarantee that financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
at december  the company had commitments totaling  for certain product development activities with third parties for in may  the company and hmri entered into an agreement to commercialize the company s ga epo product 
under the terms of the agreement  hmri is obligated to pay the company a total of  upon completion of all milestones and objectives set forth in the agreement 
as of december   the company had received  the remaining  in payments are contingent upon hmri s achievement of certain ga epo clinical development milestones 
in march  the company entered into a second agreement with hmri to commercialize ga ii 
pursuant to the agreement  the company also granted hmri an option to commercialize certain aspects of the company s gene therapy technologies applicable to this protein 
under the terms of the agreement  hmri is obligated to pay the company a total of  upon completion of all milestones and objectives set forth in the agreement 
at december   the company had received  the remaining  to be paid to the company by hmri consists primarily of milestone payments contingent upon the development of the product resulting from the licensed technology 
hmri is responsible for the worldwide development  manufacturing and marketing of ga epo  and the company is entitled to receive a royalty based on net sales 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various times through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of loss carryforwards and tax credits  the company has fully reserved against any potential tax benefit 
the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to limitation under the changes in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue code 
because of this limitation  it is possible that taxable income in future years  which would otherwise be offset by net operating losses  will not be offset and  therefore  will be subject to tax 
substantial additional funds will be required to support the company s research and development programs  for acquisition of technologies  for preclinical and clinical testing of its products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  expansion of laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  establishment of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities and for general and administrative expenses 
until such time  if any  as the company s operations generate significant revenues from product sales  cash resources  interest income and proceeds from equity offerings  debt financings and funding from collaborative arrangements will be required to fund operations 
the company expects to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through equity financings  debt financings  lease arrangements related to facilities and capital equipment and collaborative research agreements 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on the company s continued progress in its exploratory  preclinical and clinical development programs 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company expects that its existing capital resources  together with revenues from collaborative agreements and interest income  will be sufficient to fund its operations into the company s cash requirements may vary  however  depending on numerous factors 
lack of necessary funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and product development programs or to license its potential products or technologies to third parties 
the company has been engaged in litigation with amgen inc with respect to the development of ga epo 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference herein 
year the year issue results from computer programs and systems that were created to accept only two digit dates 
as a result  some computer programs are unable to differentiate between the year and the year this could result in miscalculations and system failures 
the company has established a multidisciplinary year project committee 
the committee has assessed the company s software  hardware  communications systems  applications and networks  as well as other date sensitive equipment 
mission critical systems such as the accounting system have been found compliant or will be upgraded prior to june the remaining systems are currently being tested to identify those systems which would be affected by year non compliance 
in most cases  vendors have offered free upgrades or the systems were already scheduled for upgrade 
therefore  the cost for obtaining year compliance will be minimal for internal systems 
the company believes its internal systems will not pose significant operating issues for the company as a result of the year in addition to the company s internal risks  the company is dependent upon a number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to the company 
these include financial institutions  suppliers  service providers  public utilities and research partners 
if these third parties experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to year non compliance  it could seriously affect the company s business operations 
the company is in the process of contacting its significant external business partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to their failure 
the company expects this process to be complete by september if third party providers are not able to supply the company  the company could experience delays in its research and development including delays in clinical trial development or the submission of products for regulatory approval 
as a contingency plan  the company expects to identify  if available  a secondary source for critical third party providers 
the company has not yet incurred significant cost to address the year issue 
while the total cost of obtaining year compliance is not known at this time  the company believes the cost will not be material 
forward looking statements statements that are not historical facts  including statements about the company s confidence and strategies and its expectations about future products  technologies and opportunities  market demand or acceptance of future products are forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including  without limitation  whether any of the company s gene activated  gene therapy  or niche protein product candidates will advance in the clinical trial process  the timing of such clinical trials  whether the clinical trial results will warrant continued product development  the timing of making required regulatory filings such as investigational new drug applications  and other risks set forth below  under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
patent litigation 
the biotechnology industry has been characterized by significant litigation and interference proceedings regarding patents  patent applications and other intellectual property rights  and many companies in the biotechnology industry have attempted to employ intellectual property litigation to gain or preserve a competitive advantage 
for example  there has been substantial intellectual property litigation between suppliers of erythropoietin throughout the world 
in april  amgen inc filed a civil action in the us district court in massachusetts against the company and hoechst marion roussel  inc hmri  the company s collaborative partner 
the complaint in the action alleged that the company s gene activated product development program for the production of ga epo and processes for producing ga epo infringe on amgen s us patent numbers   and  and requested that tkt and hmri be enjoined from making  using  or selling ga epo and that the court award amgen monetary damages 
in november  tkt and hmri filed a motion for summary judgment 
on the same date  amgen filed a motion for summary judgment of infringement 
tkt and hmri opposed that motion  stating that there had been no infringement 
in april  the us district court granted tkt and hmri s motion for summary judgment and denied amgen s motion for summary judgment on the ground that all of tkt and hmri s ga epo related activities to that date had been solely for uses reasonably related to the production of information for submission to the fda for regulatory approval and  under the hatch waxman act  do not constitute acts of patent infringement 
the court ordered amgen s remaining claim for declaratory judgment of future infringement administratively closed  to be reopened upon motion of either party for good cause shown 
the court also stated that the issuance by the fda of a product license presumably would constitute good cause to reopen that claim 
finally  the court stated that  should the case be reopened and should amgen seek preliminary equitable relief  the court will combine the hearing on a preliminary injunction with trial on the merits 
the company expects that the case will be reopened 
should the case be reopened  the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the litigation 
a decision by the court in amgen s favor  including the issuance of an injunction against the making  use or sale of ga epo by the company and hmri in the united states  or any other conclusion of such litigation in a manner adverse to the company and hmri  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
pursuant to the company s license agreement with hmri  hmri assumed the cost of defense of the suit by amgen 
the company will reimburse hmri for the company s share of litigation expenses  as defined  from future royalties  if any  received from the sale of ga epo and in certain other circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future become subject  in the united states or any other country  to additional patent infringement claims  interferences and other litigation involving patents  or any patents that may issue on any pending patent applications  including amgen patent applications 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming 
litigation and interference proceedings could result in substantial expense to the company or its corporate partner and significant diversion of effort by the company s technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation to which the company may become a party could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or require the company to seek licenses from third parties 
although a number of patent and intellectual property disputes in the biotechnology area have been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with any such arrangement may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to the company or its corporate partner or would be available on acceptable terms 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company or its corporate partner from manufacturing and selling some or all of its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
with respect to gene therapy technology  the company requested  and the us patent and trademark office the pto  declared in january  an interference regarding a third party s issued patent with broad claims to ex vivo gene therapy 
the participants in the interference are tkt  genetic therapy  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of novartis ag  syntex usa a wholly owned subsidiary of roche holdings  inc  and somatix 
somatix subsequently merged into cell genesys  inc with the possible exception of the patent involved in the interference  the company believes its transkaryotic therapy technology does not infringe on patents issued to date 
the pto proceeding will determine the patentability of the subject matter of the interference and which of the parties first developed this subject matter 
the process to resolve the interference can take many years 
the outcome of interferences can be quite variable for example  none of the four parties may receive the desired claims  one party may prevail  or a settlement involving two or more of the parties may be reached 
there can be no assurance that tkt will prevail in this interference or that  even if it does prevail  that the company can meaningfully protect its proprietary position 
in the event tkt does not prevail in the interference  a january federal trade commission the ftc decision may then be relevant 
the ftc entered a consent order to resolve anticompetitive concerns raised by the merger of ciba geigy limited and sandoz limited into the newly formed novartis ag 
as part of the consent order  the constituent entities of novartis will be required to provide all gene therapy researchers and developers with non exclusive licenses to the patent upon which novartis is involved in the interference 
the company has entered into an agreement with somatix under which the company s ability to market its non viral gene therapy products will not be affected should somatix win the interference 
should any of its competitors have filed additional patent applications in the us that claim technology also invented by the company  the company may have to participate in additional interference proceedings declared by the pto  all of which could result in substantial cost to the company to determine its rights or potential loss of rights 
patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success may depend in large part on its ability to obtain patent protection for its processes and potential products in the us and other countries and to obtain the right to use in its potential products genes or other technology that have been or may be patented by others 
at december   the company had six issued us patents and pending patent applications in the us to protect its proprietary methods and processes  it has also filed foreign patent applications corresponding to certain of these us patent applications 
in addition  the company has entered into several agreements to license proprietary rights from other parties 
however  the patent situation in the field of biotechnology generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date there has emerged no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to the technology used by the company will result in patents being issued or that  if issued  the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or will afford protection against competitors with similar technology 
many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  universities and research institutions  including competitors with substantial resources  have filed patent applications and have been issued patents potentially relating to the company s technologies 
in addition  certain competitors have filed patent applications and have been issued patents relating to certain methods of producing therapeutic proteins that the company anticipates producing using its gene activation technology 
the company s technologies and potential products may be found to conflict or be alleged to conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors  universities or others 
there are a substantial number of biotechnology patent applications under review at the pto 
because patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  the company cannot be certain that others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by the company or covered by the company s pending patent applications or that the company was the first to file patent applications for such technology 
competitors may have filed applications for  or may have received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to  compositions of matter or processes that block or compete with those of the company 
furthermore  as is the case with any pending patent application  competitors may attempt to amend existing applications to claim rights to compositions of matter or processes that may block the company 
no assurance can be given that the company s products or processes do not infringe patents that may issue under pending patent applications 
although the company has licensed proprietary rights to certain genes for example  for factor viii and factor ix to be used in its gene therapy products and to certain patents for example  for certain pending and issued patents related to mucopolysaccharidoses  the company presently has no proprietary rights to certain other genes that it may later seek to use in its products and which may be the subject of issued third party patents or pending patent applications 
as a result  the company may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents in order to market certain of its products 
if such licenses are not made available to the company on acceptable terms  the company will not be able to market such products 
in addition  under the company s license and sublicense agreements  the licensors and sublicensors may terminate these agreements upon the company s failure to meet certain specified milestones 
any such termination of an existing license or sublicense by any such licensor or sublicensor  or any inability by the company to obtain any required license  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company also relies upon unpatented proprietary technology  processes and know how  which the company protects in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and certain contractors 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
early stage of development  commercial uncertainty 
tkt is at an early stage of development 
all of the company s potential products are in research  preclinical development or clinical development 
no revenues have been generated from product sales  and no such revenues are expected until at the earliest 
the gene activation products currently under development by the company will require significant additional development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
there can be no assurance that any gene activation products will ultimately be developed by the company and its corporate partners  or that  even if developed  these products will receive regulatory approval 
if approved  these products may compete with established products of proven safety and efficacy  the manufacturers of which can be expected to employ intellectual property challenges to commercialization of these products 
there can be no assurance that the company s gene activation products  if any  will be able to be commercialized or  if commercialized  that they will be accepted by medical centers  hospitals  physicians or patients in lieu of existing treatments 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that these products can be successfully manufactured and marketed at prices that would permit the company and its corporate partners to operate profitably 
the company s potential gene therapy products may be even further from commercial introduction 
due to the early stage of development of the company s potential gene therapy products and the extensive research  development  preclinical and clinical testing  and regulatory review process required before marketing approval can be obtained  the company cannot predict with certainty when it will be able to commercialize any of its potential gene therapy products  if at all 
all of tkt s potential niche protein products are in research  preclinical development or clinical development 
no revenues have been generated from product sales  and the company believes no such revenues will be realized until at least extensive research  development  preclinical and clinical testing and the regulatory review process will be required before marketing approval can be obtained 
the company cannot predict with certainty when it will be able to commercialize any of its potential niche protein products  if at all 
technological uncertainty 
each of the company s three product platforms involves new and rapidly evolving technologies 
all of the company s potential products are in pre clinical or clinical stages of development and will require substantial additional development efforts and regulatory approvals prior to market introduction 
the company s gene activated and niche protein products are either in clinical development or have not yet been tested in humans 
while certain of the company s potential gene therapy products are in clinical development  the company believes that its product candidates in this area are even further from commercial introduction 
existing preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the company s potential products are limited 
for any given indication  the company s potential products may not be efficacious or may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may prevent or limit commercial use 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s products will obtain approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities for any indication 
uncertainty associated with clinical trials 
the company s potential products are in various stages of research or preclinical or clinical development 
subject to compliance with fda regulations  tkt and its corporate partners plan to undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its products in development 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  the enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and the existence of competitive clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment in the anticipated gene activation clinical trials may result in program delays  which could have a material adverse effect on tkt 
even if clinical trials are completed  there can be no assurance that the company or its partners will be able to submit a license application to the fda or comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries on the schedule anticipated or that such applications will be reviewed and approved by such regulatory agencies in a timely manner 
of the gene therapy products under development at the company  one  for the treatment of cachexia  and a second  for the treatment of hemophilia a  are in phase i clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain authorization from the fda for additional human clinical testing for any of its other gene therapy products currently in research or preclinical development 
there can be no assurance that any authorized clinical testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  with respect to any potential product 
there also can be no assurance that such testing will show any potential product to be safe or efficacious or that any such product will be approved by the fda for any indication 
furthermore  the company or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if the subjects or patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter problems in clinical trials which will cause the company or the fda to delay or suspend clinical trials 
uncertainty of government regulatory requirements  lengthy approval process 
the company s research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  facilities and manufacturing and marketing of its products will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
the regulatory process for new therapeutic products  which includes preclinical and clinical testing of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent fda regulatory approval 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in fda policy during the period of product development and fda regulatory review of each submitted license application 
similar delays may also be encountered and substantial resources expended in foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that even after such time and expenditures  regulatory approval will be obtained for any gene activated or gene therapy products developed by the company 
moreover  if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed and contain requirements for post marketing follow up studies 
because gene therapy is a relatively new technology and products for gene therapy have not been extensively tested in humans  the regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products may be subject to substantial additional review by various regulatory authorities in the us and abroad 
these requirements may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials of gene therapy products and in the regulatory approval process in general 
any of the foregoing effects of government regulation  as well as of comparable foreign regulation  could delay the marketing of the company s products for a considerable or indefinite period of time  materially increase the cost involved in developing  manufacturing and marketing the company s products  diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage the company may enjoy  or otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business 
compliance with applicable government regulations governing each of the company s potential products will require a significant commitment of time  money and effort by the company and its corporate partners with no assurances that any approval will ultimately be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
history of operating losses  future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since its inception in as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company expects that it will continue to incur substantial losses until at least and expects cumulative losses to increase until then as the company s research and development efforts expand 
the company expects that such losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve sales or profitability 
to date  the company has not received any revenues from product sales 
the company will require substantial funds to conduct research and development including preclinical and clinical testing of its potential products and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale 
based on its current operating plan  the company believes that its available cash will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs into the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress in its research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the timing and receipt of milestone payments  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  competing technological and market developments  the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  and the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities 
the company also will require capital to fund the costs of its additional facilities requirements 
the company intends to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
competition 
the biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
there can be no assurance that tkt will succeed in developing and marketing technologies and products that are more clinically efficacious and cost effective than existing established treatments or new approaches and products developed and marketed by its competitors 
the development by others of alternative or superior treatment methods could render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  treatment methods not clearly superior to the company s could achieve greater market penetration through competitors superior sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
the company s products and technologies will be subject to substantial competition from companies engaged in the commercialization of therapeutic proteins and gene therapy as well as from companies which have other forms of treatment for the diseases targeted by the company 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company  including larger research and development staffs and more experience and capabilities in conducting research and development activities  testing products in clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing  marketing and distributing products 
smaller companies may obtain access to such skills and resources through collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or academic institutions 
the company is initially focusing its gene activated product efforts on established products with proven safety and efficacy 
the company anticipates that companies selling such products will compete vigorously against any gene activated products offered by the company or its collaborators 
there can be no assurance that the company s gene activated products will be accepted by medical centers  hospitals  physicians or patients in lieu of existing products  or as to the effect of such competition on the market prices of the company s products 
the company s niche protein products are targeted at patients suffering from rare genetic diseases 
the company anticipates that the market for such products in some instances may be quite small  and that competition in the form of competitive products could place significant pressure on tkt s ability to successfully commercialize its products 
the company s competitive position also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection  secure licenses of necessary genes and technology from third parties  or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the typically substantial expenditures and period of time prior to commercial sales of each product 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving these goals 
no manufacturing or distribution or marketing capabilities  dependence on third party manufacturers 
although the company has pilot gene therapy and protein manufacturing facilities  it has only limited manufacturing experience and no commercial scale manufacturing capabilities 
the company will need to develop  contract for or otherwise arrange for such capabilities  for example  through collaborative partners  to commercialize any of its products 
if the company is delayed in establishing suitable manufacturing capabilities  the company s ability to conduct human clinical testing may be adversely affected  resulting in the delay of submission of potential products for regulatory approval and initiation of new development programs 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manufacture products at a reasonable cost  that the company will be able to price products competitively or  if priced competitively  that the company will be able to achieve margins sufficient to allow it to achieve profitability 
the company plans to provide its gene therapy products through central manufacturing facilities 
the establishment of these facilities will require substantial additional funds and personnel and will require compliance with extensive regulations applicable to such facilities 
there can be no assurance that such funds and personnel will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that the company will be able to comply with such regulations at acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  in managing this expansion the company may encounter unforeseen regulatory  logistical or management problems or incur unexpected operating costs 
failure or delays in establishing these facilities  or the incurrence of unexpected operating costs  could adversely affect the ability of the company to manufacture and market its gene therapy products 
to the extent that the company contracts with third parties for the manufacture of its products  the company will be dependent on such third parties to comply with the terms of the contracts and to manufacture for the company on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable regulations 
any failures by third parties to person their contract obligations satisfactorily may delay clinical trial development or the submission of products for regulatory approval  impair the company s ability to commercialize its products as planned and deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise adversely affect the company s competitive position 
the company has no product sales  marketing or distribution capabilities or experience 
in order to market any of its products  the company must develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  either on its own or in conjunction with others 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into any arrangements for the sale  marketing and distribution of its products  that such arrangements will be successful or that the company will be able to obtain additional capital and expertise to conduct such activities independently 
in addition  if the company chooses to conduct such activities directly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and maintain a sales force or that a sales force will be able to successfully access the markets for the company s products 
possibility of orphan drug status 
the company believes that many of the potential products in its niche protein platform may qualify as orphan drugs 
tkt intends to pursue this designation aggressively  where appropriate  with respect to its niche protein products intended for patient populations in the united states of less than  a drug that receives orphan drug designation by the fda and is the first product to receive fda marketing approval for its stated product claim is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product claim 
a drug that is considered by the fda to be different than a particular orphan drug is not barred from sale in the united states during such seven year exclusive marketing period 
furthermore  orphan drug exclusivity can be terminated for a variety of reasons  including that the manufacturer of an orphan drug cannot provide an adequate supply of the product 
there can be no assurance that orphan drug status will be afforded to any of the company s potential products  or  if afforded  that such designations will be maintained 
in addition  the company could incur substantial costs in asserting any rights to prevent such uses it may have under the orphan drug act 
legislation has in the past been introduced to limit the marketing exclusivity provided for certain orphan drugs 
although the outcome of that legislation  if reintroduced  is uncertain  there remains a possibility that future legislation will limit the incentives currently afforded to the developers of orphan drugs 
there can be no assurance that other companies will not seek such designation and obtain fda marketing approval before the company obtains such approval 
if another company obtains orphan drug marketing approval and receives seven year marketing exclusivity  it is possible that the company would not be permitted by the fda to market a similar product in the united states during the exclusivity period 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success is highly dependent on the retention of principal members of its scientific and management staff 
furthermore  the company s future growth will require the hiring of significant numbers of qualified scientific and management personnel 
accordingly  recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to the company s success 
there is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain on acceptable terms the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
dependence on collaborative partners 
the company has entered into arrangements with hmri on two of its gene activation development programs  with sumitomo on one of its niche protein products  and with gi on a gene therapy development program 
each agreement with hmri is subject to termination without cause on short notice under certain circumstances  and there is no assurance that in the future either partner will not exercise its termination rights 
the company is relying on hmri to develop  conduct clinical trials  obtain regulatory approval for the sale of  manufacture and market worldwide ga epo and ga ii 
there can be no assurance that these collaborative partners will devote the resources necessary to complete development of and commercialize these potential products 
should these collaborative partners fail to develop and commercialize these two potential products  the company s business would be materially adversely affected 
the company s strategy for the research  development and commercialization of certain of its potential products includes the possibility that it will enter into various additional arrangements with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others 
there can be no assurance that any further arrangements will be effected in the future 
although the company believes parties to any existing and future arrangements  if entered into  would have economic and other motivations to perform their contractual responsibilities in full  the amount and timing of resources which they would devote to these activities would not be within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that such parties would perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue would be derived by the company from such arrangements 
product liability and insurance 
the company s business will in the future expose it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products 
although the company has clinical trial liability insurance for trials conducted in the us  the company does not currently have any product liability insurance  and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any insurance obtained will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
an inability to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  in addition to exposing the company to significant liabilities  could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products developed by the company 
uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 
the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be affected by the efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in particular  individual pricing negotiations are often required in each country of the european community  even if approval to market the drug is obtained 
in the us there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
while the company cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect such proposals or managed care efforts may have on its business  the announcement of such proposals or efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to raise capital  and the adoption of such proposals or efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  to the extent that such proposals or efforts have a material adverse effect on other pharmaceutical companies that are prospective corporate partners for the company  the company s ability to establish corporate collaborations may be adversely affected 
in addition  in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of the company s products  if any  will be dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
if the company succeeds in commercializing products  there can be no assurance that these products will be considered cost effective  that reimbursement will be available  or if available  that the payor s reimbursement policies will be adequate to permit the company to realize a reasonable return
