in accordance with statement of position  direct response advertising and related costs for all periods presented are capitalized and amortized to selling  general and administrative expenses on an accelerated basis during the first two years of a four year period 
the amortization rate is such that of such costs are expensed after two years from the date they are incurred  and the remaining is expensed on a straight line basis over the next two years 
revenues generated from new customers as a result of direct response advertising have historically resulted in a revenue stream lasting at least seven years 
management has selected a more conservative four year amortization period  in consideration of the factors affecting future operating results described herein 
management assesses the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net benefits expected to result directly from such advertising 
other advertising  promotional  and marketing costs are charged to earnings in the period in which they are incurred

as of march   the company had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  which compares with working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  as of march  the primary reason for the increase in working capital as of march   when compared to march   was the increase in accounts receivable due to the growth of the company s diabetes supply business during the fiscal year ended march  net accounts receivable were million and million as of march  and  respectively 
as of march   liberty medical s gross unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were million as compared with million as of march  the increase is primarily a result of the overall growth of liberty medical s sales in the fiscal year ended march  in may  the health care financing administration revised the document requirements for claims to allow for faxed doctor s order authorizations for diabetes supplies which relieves liberty medical of the expensive responsibility of obtaining a mailed  original written doctor s order 
see factors affecting future operating results the company expects that its current working capital  revolving credit facility and funds generated from future operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements for current operations 
in the event that the company undertakes to make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  the company may require substantial additional funding beyond currently available working capital and funds generated from operations 
the company is conducting an active search for the strategic acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies which leverage its marketing  sales and distribution infrastructure 
the company currently has no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
year compliance many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
the company is currently addressing this concern 
it has performed a detailed assessment of all internal computer systems and  as discussed below  is developing and implementing plans to correct any problems 
the company expects these projects to be successfully completed during the remainder of calendar year problems could affect production  distribution  financial  administrative and communication operations 
systems critical to the company s business which have been identified as non year compliant are either being replaced or corrected through programming modifications or upgrades 
in addition  the company is addressing year readiness from other aspects of the business  including customer order taking  manufacturing  supply of raw materials and plant process equipment 
the company intends to have remediated or replaced internal systems by june to allow time for testing and verification 
in addition to the company s in house efforts  the company is in the process of asking vendors  major customers  service suppliers  communications providers and banks whose systems failures potentially could have a significant impact on operations to verify year readiness 
the company is testing such systems where appropriate and possible 
the company does not have a year contingency plan 
external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software for year compliance are expensed as incurred 
to date  expenditures related to the year problem have not been material 
such costs do not include normal system upgrades and replacements 
the company does not expect the future costs relating to year compliance to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the above expectations are subject to uncertainties 
for example  if the company is unsuccessful in identifying or fixing all year problems in its critical operations  or if it is affected by the inability of suppliers or major customers such as a large drug wholesaler or distributor to continue operations due to such a problem  its results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
the total costs that the company incurs in connection with the year problems will be influenced by its ability to successfully identify year systems problems  the nature and amount of programming required to fix affected programs  the related labor and or consulting costs for such remediation  and the ability of third parties with whom the company has business relationships to successfully address their own year concerns 
these and other unforeseen factors could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition 
the estimates and conclusions herein contain forward looking statements and are based on management s best estimates of future events 
risks to completing the plan include the availability of resources  the company s ability to discover and correct the potential year sensitive problems which could have a serious impact on specific facilities  and the ability of suppliers to bring their systems into year compliance 
factors affecting future operating results the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  but not limited to  statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include  among others statements regarding future benefits from the company s advertising and promotional expenditures  statements regarding future product revenue levels  statements regarding product development  introduction and marketing  and statements regarding future acquisitions  and statements regarding year compliance 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
the future operating results of the company remain difficult to predict 
the company continues to face many risks and uncertainties which could affect its operating results  including without limitation  those described below 
healthcare reimbursement political  economic and regulatory influences are resulting in fundamental changes in the healthcare industry in the united states 
the company anticipates that congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods 
sales of a large portion of the company s products depend to a significant extent on the availability of reimbursement to the company s customers by government and private insurance plans 
any change in health care delivery systems or payment methods  including any further reduction in the reimbursement provisions currently in effect for the company s diabetes supplies products which are reimbursable under medicare  could reduce the company s revenues and earnings 
the processing of third party reimbursements is a labor intensive effort  and delays in processing claims for reimbursement may increase working capital requirements 
final determination of reimbursements are subject to audit by medicare 
medicare audits of the company to date have not resulted in any significant adjustments 
future audits may  however  result in retroactive adjustments for past charges for products and services  and such adjustments could affect the future operations and earnings of the company 
effective october   new medicare reimbursement guidelines generally provide that quarterly orders of diabetes supplies to existing customers must be administratively verified before shipment and that all doctors orders for diabetic supplies are valid for a reduced period of six months 
in addition  the new regulations require that type i medicare diabetic customers who test more frequently than three times per day or type ii medicare diabetic customers who test more frequently than one time per day visit their physician every six months and maintain a day log book for compliance 
the company s customer service department  as part of its ongoing administrative contact with existing customers to obtain approval documents and answer product questions  will continue to determine testing supply levels and verify compliance testing and the renewal of doctors orders 
management is currently evaluating the effects of implementing these new guidelines 
ability to manage growth the company has expanded its operations rapidly  which has created significant demands on the company s systems  its administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and its other resources 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources  including its working capital resources  as a result of delays in processing claims for third party reimbursement 
although the company has recently upgraded its systems and taken other steps to address these issues  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective 
direct response advertising in accordance with statement of position  direct response advertising and related costs for all periods presented are capitalized and amortized to operating expenses on an accelerated basis during the first two years of a four year period 
the amortization rate is such that of such costs are expensed after two years from the date they are incurred 
revenues generated from new customers as a result of direct response advertising have historically resulted in a revenue stream lasting at least seven years 
management has selected a more conservative four year amortization period 
management assesses the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net benefits expected to result directly from such advertising 
the company can expect fluctuations in its advertising costs to attract and retain new customers 
the company expects that it will continue to incur substantial direct response advertising and related costs in connection with the further expansion of its diabetes supplies business 
medical advances there are medical technology and device companies which are conducting research and development on alternate methods for the monitoring of blood glucose levels as well as finding more effective treatment or even a cure for diabetes 
the commercial success of new products could materially affect the growth of liberty medical s diabetes supply business 
competition the company is engaged in rapidly evolving and highly competitive fields 
competition from other sellers of diabetes supplies  manufacturers of healthcare products  pharmaceutical companies and other competitors is intense and expected to increase 
many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities and experience in marketing and distribution of products than does the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing products and services that are more effective than any that are being developed or sold by the company 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the healthcare products industry include the ability to identify and respond to customer needs  quality and breadth of service and product offerings  price and technical expertise 
the company believes that its ability to compete also depends in part on a number of competitive factors outside its control  including the ability to hire and retain employees  the development by others of products and services that are competitive with the company s products and services  the price at which others offer comparable products and services and the extent of its competitors responsiveness to customer needs 
dependence on reorders change in demand for diabetes supplies the company generally incurs negative cash flow with respect to the first order for its diabetes supplies from a customer due primarily to customer acquisition costs  including advertising and medicare and secondary insurance compliance costs 
accordingly  the profitability of the company s diabetes supplies business depends on recurring orders 
reorder rates are inherently uncertain and are subject to several factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including customer shifts to nursing homes or other forms of managed care  customer mortality  changing customer preferences  customer approvals of quarterly orders  general economic conditions and customer satisfaction 
dependence on suppliers the company purchases several of its consumer healthcare products  including its thermometers  from suppliers based in the people s republic of china  usually using molds and tooling owned by or committed exclusively to the company 
to date  the company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from these suppliers 
although the company believes there are alternate sources available for these products  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to acquire products from other sources on a timely or cost effective basis in the event current foreign suppliers were unable to supply these products on a timely basis 
although the company has three long term purchase contracts with respect to its diabetes supplies business  it operates principally on a purchase order basis 
each of the company s over the counter products for urinary tract discomfort and urinary tract health is manufactured by a single supplier 
some of the company s professional products also are manufactured by single suppliers 
polymedica is currently taking steps to provide alternate sources of supply for both of these lines of products  but such efforts are not yet complete 
dependence on single manufacturing facility for professional products a majority of the company s professional products are manufactured at its headquarters facility in woburn  massachusetts 
while the company maintains business interruption insurance  any prolonged inability to utilize this facility as a result of fire  natural disaster or other event would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company complies with good manufacturing practices gmp regulations  prescribed by the food and drug administration fda  in its internal manufacturing facilities 
the fda enforces the gmp regulations through its plant inspection program 
if the company fails to comply with gmp regulations  the company could be required to make material expenditures and could experience manufacturing delays to return to compliance 
product liability the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical and consumer products entail an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against the company or its third party distributors 
certain manufacturers of healthcare products have been subjected to significant claims for damages allegedly resulting from their products 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance coverage which it believes to be adequate for its present purposes  but there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
reliance on distributors for consumer healthcare and professional products  limited direct marketing experience the company has a limited direct marketing and sales organization  and relies on its current distributors  for the sale of consumer healthcare and professional products 
the company s ability to sell its consumer healthcare and professional products will depend in part on its ability to enter into marketing and distribution agreements with pharmaceutical  medical device  personal care and other distributors in the united states and other countries 
if the company enters into any such agreements  there can be no assurance that the company s third party distributors will be able to market the company s products effectively 
integration of other businesses  products and technologies as part of its growth strategy  the company currently intends to expand through the acquisition of other businesses  products and technologies 
the company regularly reviews such potential acquisitions  some of which may be material 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully acquire any businesses  products or technologies  or that any such acquired businesses  products or technologies will be profitable 
the company does not currently have any commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
government regulation certain aspects of the company s business are subject to federal and state regulation 
federal regulation covers  among other things  reimbursement for diabetes testing supplies and the manufacturing  distribution and sale of the company s drugs and medical devices 
the company believes that its operations comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations in all material respects 
however  changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the market for the company s products and services on permissible activities of the company  and the relative costs associated with doing business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it has any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
