impact of year the year issue concerns the inability of some computer hardware and software to distinguish between the year and the year if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the company is conducting a detailed assessment of all of its information technology and non information technology hardware and software with regard to year issues 
the company s plan to ensure that its systems are year ready is comprised of cataloging all processes and systems which may have a date related component and identifying those which are not year ready  correcting or replacing those systems which are not year ready  and testing the corrected or replaced processes and systems to insure that they will  in fact  operate as desired according to year requirements 
the company is in various stages of its year readiness process at each of its facilities and expects to complete testing of the corrected or replaced systems and be fully year ready by july in addition  the company is working with its major customers and major vendors  including raw material suppliers and utility companies  to assess their internal state of year readiness 
these customer and vendor responses are evaluated for any possible risk to  or effect on  the company s operations and are incorporated into its own detailed year readiness assessment 
costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software for year readiness are expensed as incurred but have not been  and are not expected to be  material to the company s net income 
costs of replacing some of the company s systems with year ready systems have been capitalized as these new systems were acquired for business reasons and not to remediate year problems  if any  in the former systems 
based upon the results of year readiness efforts underway  the company believes that all critical information and non information technology systems and processes will be year ready and allow the company to continue operations beyond the year without a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
however  unanticipated problems which may be identified in the ongoing year readiness process could result in an undetermined financial risk 
contingency plans to counter these unanticipated problems will be developed as part of the ongoing year readiness process
