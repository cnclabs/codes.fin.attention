year disclosure the year problem concerns the inability of information systems to properly recognize and process date sensitive information beyond december  the company has evaluated the impact of the year issue on its business and does not expect to incur significant costs associated with its own year compliance or that internal year issues will have a material impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s software systems and applications are currently year compliant 
in addition  with respect to the company s ability to obtain product information  to the extent that any of the company s retail partners computer systems are not year compliant  the company will establish alternative procedures for obtaining relevant retailer information at a minimal cost to the company

the company is addressing whether these third parties in its supply chain are adequately addressing their year compliance issues 
the company has initiated communications with its significant suppliers and other vendors to determine and monitor the year issue and to evaluate the impact on the company 
failure by such parties to timely address the year issue could impact the company s ability to obtain inventory  among other things  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the company utilizes third party equipment  software and content  including non information technology systems such as building equipment and security systems that may not be year compliant 
the company is in the process of assessing whether critical third party systems and equipment and critical non information technology systems and equipment are adequately addressing the year issue 
for example  certain operating systems of third party vendors on which certain company software resides are not yet year compliant 
several of these vendors have indicated to the company that year compliant upgrades are available and the company intends to install these upgrades in the first half of failure of third party equipment  software or content to operate properly with regard to the year issue could require the company to incur unanticipated expense to remedy problems  which could have a material adverse effect of the company s business  results of operation and financial condition
