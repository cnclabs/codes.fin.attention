year compliance historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than this in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem 
the company believes that it has sufficiently assessed its state of readiness with respect to its year compliance 
as the assessment was completed using internal personnel  costs and time for such personnel were not specifically tracked 
the company  however  estimates that such costs were immaterial 
there were no external costs incurred by the company relating to its year assessment 
costs incurred to date to address the year problem have been immaterial and the company does not believe that year compliance will result in material investments by the company in the future 
the company does not believe that year compliance will result in material investments by the company  nor does the company anticipate that the year problem will have any adverse effects on the business operations or financial performance of the company

some of the company s older products  which are no longer sold  are not year compliant  however  the company offers compliant upgrades for such products

the company has established no reserve for auditing its software products or for correcting year compliance issues with such products 
although the company believes its products are year compliant  the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by issues associated with the year problem 
as companies expend significant resources to correct their current data storage solutions  these expenditures may result in reduced funds to purchase products such as those offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the year problem will not adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
conversely  the year problem may cause other companies to accelerate purchases  thereby causing an increase in short term demand and a consequent decrease in long term demand for the company s products
