the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview teletouch is a leading provider of wireless telecommunications services  primarily paging services  in non major metropolitan areas and communities in the southeast united states 
as of may  the company had approximately  pagers in service 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed  periodic fees without incurring additional selling expenses or other fixed costs 
due to the growth from the completion of the acquisitions discussed below  teletouch s results of operations for prior periods may not be indicative of future performance 
acquisitions and disposals on december   teletouch concluded its purchase of certain fcc licenses from gte for consideration of million 
total purchase price was million 
during the first nine months of fiscal year  teletouch completed the acquisition of all the stock of russell s communications  inc  dba lapageco and aacs communications  inc for cash consideration of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company also acquired substantially all the assets of warren communications  inc for cash consideration of approximately million  dave fant company  dba oklahoma radio systems for cash consideration of approximately million and cimarron towers inc for cash consideration of approximately million 
additional consideration for the assets of cimarron towers  inc was calculated at million based on actual performance for the four month period from september through december this additional consideration was paid over a six month period that began march teletouch used the available capacity under its then existing credit facility discussed below under financial condition to pay for these acquisitions 
all these acquisitions made during the first nine months of fiscal year are referred to collectively as the fiscal year acquisitions 
the pro forma effects of these acquisitions on the company s operations were not significant 
each of the fiscal year acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
for financial accounting purposes  the total purchase price for these acquisitions was allocated as follows approximately million to property  plant and equipment  million to accounts receivable  million to inventory and other assets  million to fcc licenses  million to subscriber bases  million to non compete agreements  and the remaining amount to goodwill 
on january   teletouch sold substantially all of its communications towers for approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the outstanding debt under the credit facility 
concurrent with the sale  the company leased space on the towers sold for a period of ten years for approximately 
million per year 
teletouch recognized a million gain related to the sale of the towers in fiscal and deferred the remaining million gain  which is being amortized into income over the period of the lease 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended may    and total revenue teletouch s total revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the fiscal year total revenue increase was a combination of approximately million in additional revenues from new cellular products  million in additional revenues from one time two way radio contracts  and the remainder from an increase in pagers in service resulting from internal growth 
the fiscal year increase over fiscal was due primarily to greater market penetration and the addition of operating results from the fiscal year acquisitions for a full year 
pagers in service increased to  at may  as compared to  and  at may  and  respectively 
the fiscal year acquisitions added  additional pagers during fiscal year the positive impact on total revenue of the increase in pagers in service is partially offset by the decline in average revenue per unit arpu 
arpu for the year ended may  was as compared to and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
the decrease in arpu is primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the company s subscriber base represented by resellers as well as increased competition in the company s markets 
resellers are businesses that buy airtime at wholesale prices from teletouch and sell the service to end users 
while the wholesale price to a reseller is lower than the price the company charges to its other customers  a reseller bears the cost of acquiring  billing  collecting and servicing its subscribers 
at may  approximately of the company s subscriber base was represented by resellers as opposed to at may  and at may  prior to the fiscal year acquisitions  resellers only accounted for approximately of the company s subscriber base 
beginning with its march billing  teletouch implemented a minor price increase for its basic paging service in several of its markets 
this increase was implemented throughout the th quarter of fiscal year until it was effective for all markets 
the price increase will have a positive impact on the company s future arpu  but as competitors continue to pursue its customers in the marketplace and as the percentage of its subscriber base represented by resellers increases  arpu will continue to decline 
nevertheless  teletouch expects that the growth of paging units in service and the introduction of new products and services will increase sufficiently to offset any decline in arpu and not result in a decrease in total revenue 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  were million  of total revenue  for fiscal year as compared to million  of total revenue  and million  of total revenue  for the fiscal years and  respectively 
costs increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily because of new retail store openings  tower lease expenses related to the sale of previously owned towers  and the cost of a restructuring that occurred in may  resulting in million of non recurring costs 
payroll expenses  sales commissions  office and tower leases  and network costs represented the most significant line item increases in fiscal increased costs in fiscal over were primarily attributable to the inclusion of the fiscal year acquisitions operating results for an entire year in fiscal in addition  for the year ended may   million of non recurring costs were included in operating expenses related to costs incurred in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit due to a terminated acquisition 
similar non recurring costs were million in fiscal year operating costs as a percentage of total revenue have either decreased or remained flat as the company s customer base has grown sufficiently to generate revenues at rates that have absorbed the increased costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
additional depreciation recorded on returned lease pagers accounted for most of the increase in fiscal over teletouch s emphasis on selling rather than leasing pagers should stabilize this expense in the future 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to increased amortization of intangible assets associated with the fiscal year acquisitions  which were included in results of operations for a full year in fiscal  and to the acquisition of additional tangible assets 
interest expense net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in long term debt under the credit agreement discussed below under financial condition combined with lower interest rates were the primary factors contributing to lower interest costs 
these factors  however  were partially offset by increased amortization of financing costs associated with the credit agreement 
income tax benefit at may  teletouch had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million that will begin to expire in fiscal for fiscal year the company estimates that no tax benefit will be recorded 
a valuation allowance has been recorded against deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized 
specifically  the company s carryforwards expire at specific future dates  and utilization of certain carryforwards is limited to specific amounts each year 
however  due to the uncertain nature of their ultimate realization  teletouch has established a valuation allowance against these carryforward benefits and will recognize benefits only as reassessment demonstrates they are realizable 
realization is entirely dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions 
while the need for this valuation allowance is subject to periodic review  if the allowance is reduced  the tax benefit of the carryforwards will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of the company s income tax expense 
ebitda ebitda increased to million  of total revenue million  of total revenue  including the million of costs associated with the restructuring  in fiscal year as compared to million  of total revenue million  of total revenue  including the million of costs associated with a terminated acquisition  in fiscal year and million  of total revenue million  of total revenue  including the million of costs associated with the terminated pronet merger  in fiscal year as a percentage of total revenue  ebitda did not increase in fiscal because new retail store openings  increased tower lease expenses due to the sale leaseback transaction  and restructuring costs caused expenses to grow slightly faster than revenues 
in fiscal  revenues from the fiscal store openings should grow faster than expenses for those locations 
however  more new retail store openings in fiscal could once again keep ebitda from growing as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in ebitda as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to internal growth in the company s existing markets 
financial condition due to improved operating results  teletouch s cash balance was million at may  as compared to million at may  cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company expects that cash flow provided from operations will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs in the near term 
teletouch may  however  use funds available under the credit agreement discussed below to fund future acquisitions  if any 
on january   teletouch sold substantially all of its communications towers for approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the outstanding debt under the credit facility 
concurrent with the sale  the company leased space on the towers sold for a period of ten years for approximately 
million per year 
teletouch recognized a million gain related to the sale of the towers in fiscal and deferred the remaining million gain  which is being amortized into income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease 
teletouch s operations require capital investment to purchase inventory for lease to customers and to acquire paging infrastructure equipment to support the company s growth 
net capital expenditures  including pagers  amounted to million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the fiscal year increase over fiscal year was primarily in leased pagers  the addition of new transmitter sites  and capital investments in new retail stores 
teletouch anticipates capital expenditures will be flat in fiscal as the company continues to open new retail stores  improve its infrastructure  and meet its subscribers pager needs 
teletouch will pay for these expenditures with cash generated from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under the unused portion of the credit agreement discussed below 
in january  teletouch amended its original agreement the credit facility with a group of lenders  led by chase manhattan bank 
the new agreement the credit agreement provides for loans in an amount not to exceed million  as opposed to the million provided for in the original credit facility 
as of may   million of the credit agreement was funded  and million is available for future funding 
to complete the credit agreement  the company paid approximately million in amendment fees 
these fees have been deferred and are being amortized  using the effective interest method  over the term of the existing loans 
the funding from the original credit facility was used to repay the finova loan and to provide the financing necessary to complete the fiscal year acquisitions discussed in note b in the notes to consolidated financial statements and to provide additional working capital 
as a result of the early repayment of the finova loan  teletouch paid a million prepayment penalty to finova 
the prepayment penalty of million and unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the finova loan of approximately million were recorded as an extraordinary expense item in the first quarter of fiscal year direct costs incurred in connection with obtaining the original credit facility of approximately million have been deferred and are being amortized  using the effective interest rate method  over the term of the existing loans 
the credit agreement bears interest  at the company s designation  at a floating rate of the prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
these rates vary depending on the leverage ratio of the company 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of teletouch and its subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit agreement require the principal be repaid in escalating quarterly installments beginning in august and ending in november in conjunction with the funding from the original credit facility and the credit agreement  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement that protects million of the commitments against future prime rate or libor rate increases above for the period august through july costs related to this agreement have been deferred and included with debt issuance costs and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the agreement 
for fiscal  the weighted average interest rate on the credit agreement was 
the credit agreement also requires the maintenance of specified financial and operating covenants  with which teletouch is in compliance at may   and prohibits any payments on the junior subordinated notes and the payment of dividends 
new accounting announcements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting guidelines for derivatives and requires an establishment to record all derivatives as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
additionally  this statement establishes accounting treatment for three types of hedges hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments  hedges of the variable cash flows of forecasted transactions  and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations 
any derivative that qualifies as a hedge  depending upon the nature of that hedge  will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after june  teletouch is currently analyzing the implementation requirements and does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  or cash flows 
impact of year teletouch has developed a year compliance plan to address the issue of software currently in use that may have time or date sensitivity that requires correction 
if not addressed  system failures or miscalculations could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
teletouch has contacted its major vendors and received written confirmation of year compliance from them 
these vendors provide the company with software programs that cover the transmission of paging signals  invoicing and retention of customer activity  and the reporting of the company s financial and accounting transactions 
all of these programs are covered under existing maintenance agreements  and no significant costs have been incurred with respect to year compliance issues 
although teletouch has received assurances that it will be year compliant and expects no significant issues or expenses with respect to year  the company is continuing to review its product offering for potential problems 
teletouch is also in the process of developing year contingency plans in the event of unforeseen circumstances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in teletouch s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of its total long term obligations as of may  if interest rates average one percent more in fiscal than they did during fiscal  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate long term obligations as of may  the preceding sensitivity analysis does not  however  consider the effects that such changes in interest rates may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions the company may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ from the above analysis
