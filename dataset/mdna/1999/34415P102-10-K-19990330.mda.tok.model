liquidity and capital resources typically  the company s primary cash requirements have been to fund increased levels of inventories  accounts receivable and operations 
the company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations and borrowings 
at december   the company had working capital of  compared to working capital of  at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to decreased accounts receivables from lower sales and lower inventory caused by a short supply of product offset by lower borrowings under the company s former credit line 
the losses sustained from operations have significantly reduced the company s liquidity 
additionally  as a result of the company s operating losses  certain vendors have restricted credit to the company 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was  in  and  in the increase in cash provided by operations for was primarily attributable to the reduced net loss  and decrease in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities was  in  versus cash provided by investing activities of  in the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the collection of notes receivable in net cash provided by used in financing activities was  in and  in the decrease was primarily attributable to the advances of the company s line of credit in whilst in  the company repaid and terminated this line of credit with a portion of the proceeds from its private placement of convertible notes 
in january  the managing underwriter exercised an over allotment option the over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of  in november  the company consummated a private placement of convertible notes for resulting in net proceeds of   net of  offering costs 
in january  the company entered into a new loan agreement with bankamerica business credit  inc bankamerica which provided for borrowings under a line of credit of up to  advances under the line of credit were based on a borrowing formula equal to the sum of i of eligible accounts receivable and ii the lower of  or of eligible inventory 
interest accrued on such advances at the prime lending rate plus one half of one percent 
per annum and was payable monthly 
in november  the company paid off the remaining balance owing to bankamerica and terminated this agreement 
the company has increasingly emphasized the sale of products on open account to maintain competitive other distributors who routinely grant credit 
for the years ended december   and   and of the company s sales were made on open account 
inventory turns decreased from times during to times during the company s trade accounts receivable  less allowances for doubtful accounts at december   was  as compared to  at december  and as compared to  at december  as of december   accounts days past due were approximately of aggregate trade accounts receivable as compared to of aggregate trade accounts receivable at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was  at december   and  at december  the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable results primarily from the company s largest customer in of total sales sustaining severe financial difficulties 
the company currently believes that this customer is out of business and that its assets have been taken over by another supplier customer and competitor 
the company has abandoned its pursuit in connection with the foregoing and wrote off the account in other significant decreases in the allowance for doubtful account receivables relate to domestic accounts aggregating  and foreign accounts aggregating  included in the balance  written off in at december   notes receivable  less the allowance for doubtful notes receivable was nil as compared to  at december  the allowance for doubtful notes receivable at december   was  as compared to  at december  notes receivable are the result of converting aged accounts receivable into interest bearing promissory notes with a fixed maturity 
of the notes receivable for which an allowance is provided  one note due from a foreign customer accounts for of the total 
bad debt expense for trade accounts receivable and notes receivable equaled  or of the company s revenues for and  or of the company s revenues for the company believes the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and doubtful notes receivable are adequate for the size and nature of its receivables 
nevertheless  further delays in the collection or the uncollectibility of accounts receivable will continue to have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity and working capital position 
because of market considerations the company will offer open account terms to additional customers  which will subject the company to increased credit risks  particularly in foreign markets  and could require the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company attempts to minimize losses on credit sales by monitoring its customers creditworthiness 
the company seeks to obtain letters of credit or similar security in connection with open account sales to customers located in foreign markets 
at december   the company s inventory reserve was  which the company believes is currently adequate for obsolescence and net realizable value  given the size and nature of its inventories 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize could  however differ materially from the amounts estimated in arriving at the inventory reserve 
based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations  the company believes that with the funds raised in both the offering and the subsequent exercise of  warrants  projected cash flow from operations and available cash resources  should be sufficient to satisfy its near term cash requirements 
however  the company is seeking to obtain a new line of credit to finance future growth 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the company is also seeking to address its liquidity concerns by attempting to secure more favorable contracts for supply of products with manufacturers of digital wireless equipment 
in addition  the company intends on establishing more stringent criteria to evaluate creditworthiness prior to extending credit to customers and limit the risk of additional bad debt with credit insurance 
no assurance can be given that these measures will help to alleviate the liquidity concerns faced by the company 
the company s common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in order to continue to be listed on nasdaq  however  the company must maintain certain requirements 
in january  the company received a notice from nasdaq that it planned to delist the company s common stock based on nasdaq s determination that the company will be unable to continue to maintain compliance with nasdaq s minimum net worth requirement 
the company has appealed this determination to a nasdaq panel hearing that will be held in april although the company is currently in compliance with nasdaq s net worth requirement and believes that it has presented to nasdaq a viable business plan for maintaining compliance with this requirement  there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in its appeal 
if nasdaq were to delist the company s common stock  the lack of a nasdaq listing of its securities could make it more difficult for the company to do any equity financings in the future 
seasonality sales of the company s products are seasonal and are a function of consumer sales  with peak product shipments typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
inflation inflation has historically not had a material effect on the company s operations 
year compliance overview and background the company is implementing a project the project to address the year readiness of its information technology as well as its non information technology systems eg telephones  alarm systems  office machines  etc 
which have embedded technology collectively referred to as systems 
additionally  the project includes assessment of the year readiness of the company s significant suppliers and customers 
status of the project the project is divided into four separate phases planning and awareness  inventory  assessment and renovate 
the planning and awareness phase began in november and is scheduled for completion in early may this phase included i development and approval of the project charter  ii formation of a project management team to carry out the project charter  iii identification and assessment of overall project risks and iv development of a project budget 
because the company does not believe that its customers year compliance issues will have a significant impact on the company  the company plans on conducting informal conversations about year issues with its customers 
in april  the company will implement the inventory phase of the project  which involves i identification of significant systems to be assessed and ii identification of all significant suppliers and customers 
the assessment phase is scheduled to begin in may  with an anticipated completion date of august this phase involves i contacting vendors of significant systems to assess the year readiness of those systems  ii testing of the assertions made by significant systems vendors  iii contacting significant suppliers  customers and wireless network operators in order to ascertain their state of year readiness  iv assessment of assertions made by significant suppliers and customers  v determination of the extent to which renovation will be required to insure year readiness and vi development of contingency plans to the extent considered necessary 
once the assessment phase is completed for each system  the renovation phase will commence for those systems identified as not year compliant 
the renovation phase is projected to be completed by mid the activities that will be performed during renovation include i repairing  replacing or reprogramming all significant systems that do not comply with year readiness  ii testing and validation of renovated systems and iii establishment and completion of action plans to address any year issues with significant customers and suppliers 
costs the company will rely primarily on internal resources to implement and fund the project 
costs incurred to insure the company s systems are year compliant are not expected to exceed  or to be material to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows since the company has already been in the process of upgrading certain systems to keep pace with new computer and software technologies 
project costs are and will be expensed as incurred 
risks and contingencies the company believes that the project will meets its year objectives in a timely manner 
however  the company has not completed significant portions of the project 
the ability of suppliers and customers with which the company transacts to timely convert their systems to be year compliant is uncertain 
lastly  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also have an adverse affect on the company s operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
the company is dependent on wireless equipment manufacturers for supply of wireless handsets and accessories 
additionally  demand for the company s products wireless handsets and accessories by the company s customers is dependent on the ability of network operators to provide wireless network services to the end users of those products 
failure in the products and or systems of the wireless equipment manufacturers or network operators  including those resulting from a lack of year compliance  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the estimated completion dates for the various phases and estimated costs are dependent upon management s assumptions of certain future events  such as compliance efforts  the availability of personnel and ability to locate and renovate all systems 
there can be no assurance that third parties which the company significantly relies upon will succeed in their year compliance efforts or that failure by third parties would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition
