year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail
