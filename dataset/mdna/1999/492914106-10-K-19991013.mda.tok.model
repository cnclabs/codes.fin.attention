business strategy over the past several years  key has been actively consolidating the well servicing industry  completing in excess of fifty acquisitions 
this consolidation has led to reduced fragmentation in the well servicing market and is expected to lead to more predictable demand and pricing for well services 
in response to record depressed market conditions during much of fiscal year and in conjunction with the completion of i significant acquisitions during the fall of and ii the public offering of common stock in the spring of  the company streamlined operations and materially reduced indebtedness 
as a result  management believes that the company has better positioned itself for profitable growth as industry conditions continue to recover and improve for the following reasons reduced operating and financial costs  increased diversity and size of equipment fleets  increased ability to offer a complete range of oilfield services as a single source provider  increased geographic diversity of operations  more balanced exposure to demand for both oil and natural gas related oilfield services  increased contribution to revenues from contract drilling and other higher growth  higher margin services  future opportunities to enter into strategic relationships or alliances with operators as a preferred service provider in certain domestic and international locations  and future opportunities to make strategic acquisitions to enhance our existing operations 
major developments during fiscal industry downturn  company s response and recent recovery throughout calendar year  key benefited from an increase in utilization of its rigs  trucks and other services and equipment and improvements in pricing associated with the increased demand for these services 
during the fourth quarter of calendar year  an imbalance began to develop in the supply and the demand for crude oil 
reduced demand was fueled by the asian recession and two consecutive unusually warm winters in north america 
the supply of crude oil increased as a result of increased production quotas by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and renewed production by iraq 
the resulting excess supply of crude oil caused significant declines in oil prices during calendar year crude oil prices averaged to per barrel during calendar year compared to to per barrel during calendar year and reached a year low of below per barrel in december natural gas prices were also lower during the second half of calendar year as unusually warm winters in north america during calendar years and resulted in weaker demand with prices reaching a low of approximately per mcf in early calendar year reduced prices for oil and gas led to a sharp decline in the demand for oilfield services as oil and gas companies significantly reduced capital spending for exploration  development and production activities well into calendar year key s operations were most significantly impacted by the downturn in the industry starting in the month of december the severe downturn continued and worsened for key s operations during the march quarter as virtually all expected new capital spending related to oilfield services  such as drilling  workovers and completions  failed to materialize 
the halliburton guiberson us well service rig count averaged  during calendar year and reached a low of  in february compared to  during calendar year similarly  the baker hughes us land drilling rig count averaged during calendar year and reached a low of in april compared to during calendar year in response to the industry downturn  the company developed and implemented a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce operating costs beyond those achieved through its prior consolidation efforts 
the plan involved a reduction in the size of management and on site work force  salary reductions averaging for senior management  the combination of previously separate operating divisions and the elimination of redundant overhead and facilities 
the company estimates that it has achieved annualized operating cost savings in excess of million through the implementation of the restructuring plan and the integration of the dawson acquisition discussed below 
in connection with the restructing plan  the company took pretax charges to earnings of approximately million in the second quarter ending december  and million in the third quarter ending march  in march  opec and other non opec countries  which had already lowered their production during calendar year  substantially reduced production to a point which  depending on opec compliance with its new production quotas  was expected to be below the stable to improving demand for oil 
as a result of these new production levels  assumed strong quota compliance  and improving demand for oil  world oil prices recovered significantly during through the spring and summer of to levels in excess of per barrel 
in addition  domestic natural gas prices increased significantly during the summer of as increased demand due to a hot summer in the united states  combined with stable to decreasing deliverability due to depletion and reduced natural gas drilling activity due to the forementioned capital spending cuts  caused concerns regarding a possible imbalance between gas supply and demand  particularly headed into the fall and winter of despite improved commodity prices  capital spending by oil companies remained at reduced levels during the first half of calendar year as i capital markets remained largely unavailable to producers  ii many producers  including a number of the majors  were acquiring  merging  reorganizing or divesting operations  or integrating recent combinations  and iii many producers were conserving cash to preserve or improve their financial condition or to await improved commodity prices 
subsequent to the rig count lows of february to april  and as a direct result of the improvement in oil and natural gas prices during the spring and summer of  the halliburton rig count has recovered to  as of august and the baker hughes rig count has improved to as of october  the recoveries in these rig counts  particularly the baker hughes rig count  are indicative of a recovery in capital spending on oilfield services such as drilling  workovers and completions 
key benefited from this recovery during the quarter ended june  as total revenues increased by approximately from the levels of the quarter ended march  as a result of this recovery  the company amended its restructuring plan to decrease the number of planned employee terminations 
increased demand for the company s services made such terminations unnecessary and would have  in management s opinion  restricted the company s future ability to provide services to its customers 
consequently  the company did not utilize approximately million of the pretax charges 
essentially all of the unutilized portion of the restructuring charge was reversed in the fourth quarter ending june   resulting in a total pretax charge for the fiscal year ended june  of approximately million 
the level of key s revenues  cash flows  losses and earnings are substantially dependent upon  and affected by  the level of domestic and international oil and gas exploration and development activity 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition equity offering on may   the company closed the public offering of  shares of common stock  shares of which were sold pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option discussed below at per share  or million the public offering 
in addition  the company closed the offering of  shares of common stock at per share  or million the concurrent offering and together with the public offering  the equity offering 
in addition  on june   the underwriters of the public offering exercised an over allotment option to purchase an additional  million shares to cover over allotments 
net proceeds from the equity offering were approximately million  approximately million of which was used to immediately repay a portion of the company s senior credit facility bank term loans approximately million for the tranche a term loan and approximately million for the tranche b term loan and million of which was used  subsequent to the equity offering  to repay a portion of the senior credit facility revolver 
after repayments and as of june   the outstanding loan balances were approximately million for the tranche a term loan  approximately million for the tranche b term loan  and million for the revolver 
as a result of the equity offering  total shares outstanding are approximately million  an increase of approximately over the amount outstanding immediately prior to the equity offering 
see note to consolidated financial statements stockholders equity 
senior credit facility in connection with the dawson acquisition referred to below  the company entered a  second amended and restated credit agreement  among key energy group  inc  pnc bank  national association  norwest bank texas  na  pnc capital markets  inc and the several lenders from time to time parties thereto  dated as of june   as amended and restated through september  the credit agreement 
between november and may  the credit agreement was amended to i reduce the maximum amount of credit available thereunder to million  ii change the interest rates payable thereunder  iii ease required financial covenant levels  delete certain financial covenants and add others  iv add a requirement that the company achieve certain minimum levels of trailing month ebitda  v tighten restrictions on acquisitions  vi modify the amount to be prepaid if the company issues additional capital stock or if the company has excess cash flow as defined or if the company sells certain specific assets  and vii provide minimum levels of consolidated liquidity as defined 
see note to consolidated financial statements long term debt 
high yield units offering on january   the company completed the private placement of  units the units consisting of  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes and  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the unit warrants 
the cash proceeds from the placement were used to repay substantially all of the remaining million principal amount plus accrued interest owed under the company s bridge loan facility arranged in connection with the acquisition of dawson production services  inc in september because the equity offering indirectly triggered certain anti dilution provisions applicable to the unit warrants  the aggregate number of shares into which the unit warrants are exercisable was increased by an additional  shares see note to consolidated financial statements long term debt 
dawson acquisition in september  the company completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of dawson production services  inc dawson for an aggregate consideration of approximately million  including approximately million of cash paid for the dawson stock and for transactional fees and approximately million of net liabilities assumed 
at the time of the closing  dawson owned approximately well service rigs  oilfield trucks  and production testing units in south texas and the gulf coast  east texas and louisiana  the permian basin of west texas and new mexico  the anadarko basin of texas and oklahoma  california  and in the inland waters of the gulf of mexico 
other acquisitions in addition to its acquisition of dawson  the company acquired the assets or capital stock of six well servicing and contract drilling businesses during fiscal  increasing its rig and truck fleet by a total of approximately well service rigs  drilling rigs and oil fields trucks and related equipment for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash 
along with dawson  these acquisitions established the company as the leading oilfield trucking contractor in south texas  enabled the company to expand into the ontario  canada well service and drilling market and provided the company with additional equipment and market share in the rocky mountain and four corners regions 
description of lines of business the company s three lines of business are well servicing  contract drilling and oil and natural gas production 
the following is a description of each of these lines of business for financial information regarding these lines of business  see note to consolidated financial statements business segment information 
well servicing the company provides a full range of well services  including rig based services  oilfield trucking and ancillary oilfield services  necessary to maintain and workover producing oil and gas wells 
rig based services include maintenance of existing wells  completion of newly drilled wells  workovers of existing wells  recompletion of existing wells including horizontal recompletions and the plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives 
well service rigs the company utilizes its well service rig fleet to perform four major categories of rig services to oil and gas operators 
maintenance services 
the company estimates that there are approximately  producing oil wells and approximately  producing natural gas wells in the united states 
while some wells in the united states flow oil to the surface without mechanical assistance  most are in mature production areas that require pumping or some other method of artificial lifting 
oil wells that require pumping characteristically require more maintenance than flowing wells due to the operation of the mechanical pumping equipment installed 
maintenance services are therefore required on most producing oil wells to ensure efficient and continuous operation 
these services consist of routine mechanical repairs necessary to maintain production from the well  such as repairing parted sucker rods or defective down hole pumps in an oil well  or replacing defective tubing in an oil or gas well 
the company provides the well service rigs  equipment and crews for these maintenance services  which are performed on both oil and natural gas wells  but which are more commonly required on oil wells 
maintenance jobs are often performed on a series of wells in proximity to each other and typically take less than hours to complete per well 
the average cost of a maintenance job typically ranges between and  excluding the costs of parts  services and other vendors at the wellsite 
maintenance services are generally required throughout the life of a well 
the need for these services does not directly depend on the level of drilling activity and is generally independent of short term fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
accordingly  maintenance services are generally the most stable type of well service activity 
the general level of maintenance  however  is affected by changes in the total number of producing oil and gas wells in the company s geographic service areas 
workover services 
in addition to periodic maintenance  producing oil and gas wells occasionally require major repairs or modifications  called workovers 
workover services include extensions of existing wells to drain new formations either through deepening well bores or through drilling of horizontal laterals 
in less extensive workovers  the company s rigs are used to seal off depleted zones in existing well bores and to access previously bypassed productive zones 
the company s workover rigs are also used to convert producing wells to injection wells for enhanced recovery operations 
other workover services include major subsurface repairs such as casing repair or replacement  recovery of tubing and removal of foreign objects in the well bore  repairing downhole equipment failures  plugging back the bottom of a well to reduce the amount of water being produced with the oil and natural gas  cleaning out and recompleting a well if production has declined  and repairing leaks in the tubing and casing 
these extensive workover operations are normally performed by a well service rig with a workover package  which may include rotary drilling equipment  mud pumps  mud tanks and blowout preventers depending upon the particular type of workover operation 
most of the company s well service rigs are designed for and can be equipped to perform complex workover operations 
a workover project may last from a few days to several weeks 
the average cost of a workover project typically ranges between  and  excluding the costs of parts  services and other vendors at the wellsite 
the demand for workover services is more sensitive to expectations relating to and changes in oil and gas prices than the demand for maintenance services  but not as sensitive as the demand for completion services 
as oil and gas prices decrease  operators defer workovers due to insufficient rates of return on workover projects and constrained liquidity 
as oil and gas prices increase  the level of workover activity tends to increase as operators seek to increase production by enhancing the efficiency of their wells at higher commodity prices with correspondingly higher rates of return 
completion services 
completion services prepare a newly drilled well for production 
the completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing to access producing zones  stimulating and testing these zones and installing downhole equipment 
the company provides a well service rig and workover package to assist in the completion process 
newly drilled wells are frequently completed by a well service rig  so that an operator can minimize the use of a higher cost drilling rig 
the completion process typically requires a few days to several weeks  depending on the nature and type of the completion  and generally requires additional auxiliary equipment that the company provides for an additional fee 
the average cost of a completion typically ranges between  and  excluding the costs of parts  services and other vendors at the wellsite 
the demand for well completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels  which are highly sensitive to expectations relating to and changes in oil and gas prices 
as the number of newly drilled wells decrease  the number of completion jobs correspondingly decreases 
in addition  during periods of weak drilling demand and particularly in connection with deeper gas wells  drilling contractors may be able to price well completion work competitively compared to a well service rig so that the drilling rig will be used to complete the newly drilled well 
thus  excess drilling capacity could serve to reduce the amount of completion work available to the well servicing industry 
plugging and abandonment services 
well service rigs and workover equipment are also used in the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells 
the demand for oil and gas does not significantly affect the demand for plugging and abandonment services  as this activity is primarily driven by regulatory  lease  and or operator policy requirements 
oilfield trucking the company provides liquid vacuum truck services and fluid transportation and disposal services for operators whose wells produce  in addition to oil and natural gas  saltwater and other fluids 
these trucks are also utilized in connection with drilling and workover projects  which tend to produce and use large amounts of various oilfield fluids 
in addition  the company provides haul equipment trucks which are used to move large pieces of equipment from one wellsite to the next 
ancillary oilfield services the company provides ancillary oilfield services  which include among others hot oiling  wireline and production testing  frac tank rentals  well site construction  roustabout services  fishing and other tool rentals  supplying blowout preventers bops  oilfield equipment sales  oilfield equipment refurbishing  tubing testing  foam units and air drilling services  and pipeline installation and inspection 
contract drilling the company provides contract drilling services for major and independent oil companies onshore the continental united states in the permian basin  the four corners area  michigan  the northeast  the gulf coast  and the rocky mountains  and internationally in argentina and ontario  canada 
drilling rigs come in a wide variety of sizes and capabilities  and may include specialized equipment 
the rigs are classified by their depth capabilities and by whether their power systems are mechanical or diesel electric  with most of the company s rigs being classified as mechanical rigs 
the depth ratings of the company s rigs range from  feet to  feet for an average of approximately  feet 
oil and natural gas production the company is engaged in the production of oil and natural gas in the permian basin and panhandle areas of west texas through its wholly owned subsidiary  odessa exploration incorporated odessa exploration 
odessa exploration manages interests in producing oil and gas properties for its own account and for drilling partnerships it sponsors 
odessa exploration operates oil and gas wells on behalf of over working interest owners as well as for its own account 
on june   the company announced that it had retained an investment banking firm to provide advisory services in connection with a contemplated sale of odessa exploration 
foreign operations the company provides oilfield services in argentina and canada 
the company currently owns well servicing rigs  oilfield trucks and seven drilling rigs in argentina and one well servicing rig  two oilfield trucks and three drilling rigs in ontario  canada 
customers our customers include major oil and gas companies  foreign national oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies 
the company had no single customer in fiscal that accounted for or more of consolidated revenues 
competition and other external factors despite a significant amount of consolidation having occurred  the domestic well servicing industry remains somewhat fragmented and includes a small number of companies that are capable of competing effectively in the company s well servicing markets 
nonetheless  the company believes that it is competitive in terms of performance  equipment  safety  pricing  availability of equipment to meet customer needs and availability of experienced  skilled personnel in those regions in which it operates 
in the well servicing markets  an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term customer relationships is having an experienced  skilled and well trained work force 
in recent years  many of the company s larger customers have placed increased emphasis on the safety records and quality of the crews  equipment and services provided by their contractors 
the company believes that such factors will be of increasing importance in the future 
the company has devoted substantial resources toward employee safety and training programs  as well as its employee review process 
while the company s efforts in these areas are not unique  many competitors  particularly small contractors  have not undertaken similar training programs for their employees 
management believes that the company s safety record and reputation for quality equipment and service are among the best in the industry 
the company competes not only with other regional oil and gas drilling contractors but also with national oil and gas drilling companies  with larger and more versatile rig fleets and better capital resources than the company 
in addition  the number of drilling rigs continues to exceed demand in many of the company s drilling markets  resulting in a market that is more competitive than well servicing 
nonetheless  the company believes that it is competitive in terms of performance  equipment  safety  pricing  availability of equipment to meet customer needs and availability of experienced  skilled personnel in those regions in which it operates 
the need for oilfield services fluctuates  in part  in relation to the demand for oil and natural gas 
as demand for those commodities increases  service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the producing efficiency of their wells in a higher priced environment 
employees as of june   the company employed approximately  persons approximately  in oilfield services  ten in oil and gas production and in corporate 
the company s employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the company has experienced no work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
environmental regulations the oilfield service operations and the oil and gas production and drilling activities of the company are subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations intended to protect the environment 
the company s operations routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
consequently  the regulations applicable to the company s operations include those with respect to containment  disposal and controlling the discharge of any hazardous oilfield waste and other non hazardous waste material into the environment  requiring removal and cleanup under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party 
such laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others  or for acts of the company which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the times such acts were performed 
cleanup costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws  and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
from time to time  claims have been made and litigation has been brought against the company under such laws 
however  the costs incurred in connection with such claims and other costs of environmental compliance have not had any material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial statements in the past  and management is not currently aware of any situation or condition that it believes is likely to have any such material adverse effect in the future 
management of the company believes that it conducts its operations in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local regulations as they relate to the environment 
although the company has incurred certain costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations  such amounts have not been material to the company s financial results during the three past fiscal years

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the following discussion provides information to assist in the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal year ended june  the company s results of operations for the year ended june  reflect the impact of a significant and unprecedented decline in demand for the company s equipment and services in all of the company s lines of business experienced from december to march the company believes that the decline in demand for its equipment and services during fiscal was due solely to the adverse impact on its customers capital spending caused by a decline in oil prices to a twelve year low of below per barrel in december  and  to a lesser extent  a significant decline in natural gas prices see part i item major developments during fiscal industry downturn  company s response and recent recovery 
near the beginning of this decline  during the first four months of fiscal  the company completed seven acquisitions 
while the positive impact of these fiscal acquisitions as well as the impact of a full months of the prior fiscal year s acquisitions on the company s revenues compensated for the negative revenue impact of the decline in business  the acquisitions could not compensate for and could only partially offset the company s decline in net income see note to consolidated financial statements business and property acquisitions 
the company revenues for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  while net income for fiscal decreased  from a positive  in fiscal to a net loss of  in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to well servicing and contract drilling acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal  partially offset by a significant decline in equipment utilization and  to a lesser extent  pricing of oilfield services throughout fiscal the decrease in net income is due to the decline in equipment utilization and  to a lesser extent  pricing of oilfield services during most of fiscal and the existence of a high level of fixed costs and expenses  including depreciation  depletion and amortization  general and administrative  and interest 
in addition  fiscal included charges for bad debt expense  debt issuance costs and restructuring that were far greater than such charges taken during fiscal operating revenues well servicing 
well servicing revenues for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal partially offset by a significant decline in equipment utilization and  to a lesser extent  pricing of oilfield services throughout fiscal contract drilling 
revenues from contract drilling activities for the year ended june  decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a significant decline in equipment utilization and  to a lesser extent  pricing of oilfield services throughout fiscal partially offset by acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal oil and natural gas production 
revenues from oil and natural gas production activities for the year ended june  decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the price of oil and gas received on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis in fiscal  compared to fiscal  partially offset by a increase  from fiscal to fiscal  in the volume of oil and gas produced on a boe basis 
operating expenses well servicing 
well servicing expenses for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal partially offset by a significant decline in equipment utilization and  to a lesser extent  pricing of oilfield services throughout fiscal well servicing expenses  as a percentage of well servicing revenue  increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase was due to a shift in revenue mix from higher margin  higher priced well services to lower margin  lower priced well services  reduced pricing for well services  and a lag in reducing costs in response to declines in utilization and revenues 
contract drilling 
expenses related to contract drilling activities for the year ended june  decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a significant decline in equipment utilization and  to a lesser extent  pricing of oilfield services throughout fiscal partially offset by acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal contract drilling expenses  as a percentage of contract drilling revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase was due to reduced pricing for contract drilling and a lag in reducing costs in response to declines in utilization and revenues 
oil and natural gas production 
expenses related to oil and natural gas production activities for the year ended june  decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal oil and natural gas production costs decreased from per boe in fiscal to per boe in fiscal the decrease per boe is primarily due to an increase in gas production as compared to oil production  from the prior year  resulting from to an acquisition of natural gas properties during the latter portion of fiscal and development drilling of natural gas wells during fiscal and the early portion of fiscal depreciation  depletion and amortization expense the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in oilfield service depreciation resulting from the well servicing and contract drilling acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to well servicing and contract drilling acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal interest expense the company s interest expense for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional debt incurred in connection with the well servicing and contract drilling acquisitions completed during the latter portion of fiscal and the early portion of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates and amortization of additional debt issuance costs see note to consolidated financial statements long term debt 
bad debt expense the company s bad debt expense for the year ended june  increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the significant decline in commodity prices and a corresponding deterioration in market conditions in fiscal causing a small number of the company s customers to become insolvent 
debt issuance costs during fiscal  the company recorded an expense of  which represented the write off of debt issuance costs 
the debt issuance costs were associated with the company s bridge loan which was subsequently repaid using the proceeds from the company s private offering of senior subordinated notes 
restructuring charge in response to an industry downturn caused by historically low oil and gas prices and the resulting slowdown in business  on december   the company announced a company wide restructuring plan to reduce operating costs beyond those achieved through the company s consolidation efforts 
the plan involved a reduction in the size of management and on site work force  salary reductions averaging for senior management  the combination of previously separate operating divisions and the elimination of redundant overhead and facilities 
the restructuring plan resulted in pretax charges to earnings of approximately million in the second quarter ending december  and million in the third quarter ending march  however  due to an increase in oil and gas prices beginning during the company s fourth fiscal quarter  the company amended its restructuring plan to decrease the number of planned employee terminations

year issue many older computer programs were written using a two digit year instead of a four digit year 
as a result  those computer programs may be unable to process date sensitive information in the year and beyond 
this situation  frequently referred to as the year or yk issue  could cause a temporary disruption of the ordinary course of business 
moreover  as a result of the acquisitions completed by the company over the past three years  the company has simultaneously utilized multiple management information systems in connection with its business operations and financial reporting process 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company made an assessment of its year issues in early calendar year  and at that time determined that many of these management information systems might be adversely impacted by the arrival of the year accordingly  for operational efficiency and to prevent any adverse impacts that may result from the arrival of year  in july the company commenced the implementation of a new integrated management information system along with updated hardware that replaced most of the systems previously utilized by the company 
the implementation of the new integrated management information system  which has been certified by its vendor to be year compliant  is substantially complete 
while this new management information system does not cover the company s argentine operations  the company is currently implementing a separate management information system for its argentine operations that uses software that is virtually identical to the company s domestic management information system software  that the company expects to be in place in late calendar year through june   the company has capitalized approximately  for its new management information system 
the inventory  assessment  modification and testing of smaller  less critical  financial and operational systems have been substantially completed

to date  there has been no discovery of a significant non compliant embedded system 
the company has communicated with the suppliers  customers and financial institutions that it considers to be material third parties and is evaluating its risks related to any possible failure of such third parties to be year compliant 
the effect  if any  on the company s results of operations arising from the failure of these third parties to be year compliant is not reasonably estimable at this time 
risk assessment and contingency plans related to these parties are expected to be complete by the end of november contingency plans to mitigate the company s risks from year related interruptions are being developed and are expected to be complete by the end of november although the company believes that in a most reasonably likely worst case scenario it will not be materially impacted by its or any third party non compliance  there can be no assurances that failure by the company or by third parties to fully implement appropriate year plans will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
adverse effects on the company could include  among other things business disruptions eg  computer downtime and reversion to manual accounting records for billings  payments and collections  increased costs  and loss of revenues 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about key s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange risk  interest rates and oil and gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how key views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate risk at june   key had long term debt outstanding of  of this amount   or  bears interest at fixed rates as follows s balance at convertible subordinated notes due  senior subordinated notes due  convertible subordinated debentures due  dawson senior notes due  other rates generally ranging from to  the remaining  of debt outstanding as of june  bears interest at floating rates which averaged approximately at the end of a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at the end of would equal approximately basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase key s fiscal interest expense by approximately million assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
foreign currency risk key s net assets  net earnings and cash flows from its argentina subsidiaries are currently not exposed to foreign currency risk  as argentina s currency is tied to the u 
s 
dollar 
key s net assets  net earnings and cash flows from its canadian subsidiary is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of the canadian operations are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
a change in the canadian to u 
s 
dollar exchange rate would not be material to the net assets  net earnings or cash flows of key 
commodity price risk key s major market risk exposure for its oil and gas production operations is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas sales 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
key periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through commodity option contracts whereby key will receive a fixed price for its production if the market price is in excess of the contract s stated price 
key pays a premium for its option contracts 
such premiums are amortized to oil and gas revenues over the life of the related option contracts 
these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage key s exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains from the settlement of these financial hedging instruments are recognized in oil and gas sales when the associated production occurs 
the gains and losses realized as a result of these hedging activities are substantially offset in the cash market when the hedged commodity is delivered 
key does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   key had oil and gas price hedging instruments in place which represented  barrels of oil production per month and approximately  mmbtu of gas production per month 
the total fiscal hedged oil and gas volumes represent approximately and  respectively  of expected calendar year total production 
a increase in the index price of oil or gas from their levels at june  would have no impact on the company s net assets  net earnings or cash flows as derived from commodity option contracts  as the put options outstanding at june  are not in the money see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion
