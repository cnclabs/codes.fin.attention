net sales of million in decreased by million  or  compared to sales of million in the decrease is attributable primarily to the loss of revenues resulting from the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group and solair 
approximately of the current year s sales growth came from acquisitions in the aerospace fasteners segment 
divestitures decreased our growth by approximately and our internal growth was down 
net sales of million in increased by million  or  compared to sales of million in sales growth was stimulated by the resurgent commercial aerospace industry and business acquisitions  partially offset by the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group 
approximately of the sales growth was stimulated by the resurgent commercial aerospace industry 
on a pro forma basis  net sales decreased and increased in and  respectively  as compared to the previous fiscal periods 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was  and in   and  respectively 
included in cost of goods sold for was a charge of million recognized in our aerospace distribution segment from the disposition of solair and the potential disposition of dallas aerospace 
of this charge  million was attributable to solair s bulk sale of inventory at prices below this carrying amount 
excluding these charges  gross margin as a percentage of sales was in fiscal the lower margins in the fiscal period are attributable to a change in product mix in our aerospace distribution segment as a result of the dispositions 
partially offsetting the overall lower margins was an improvement in margins within our aerospace fasteners segment resulting from acquisitions  efficiencies associated with increased production  improved skills of the work force  and reduction in the payment of overtime 
decreased margins in the fiscal period were attributable to a change in product mix in the aerospace distribution segment as a result of the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group 
selling  general administrative expense as a percentage of sales was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
included in selling  general administrative expense in fiscal were million of one time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
excluding these costs  selling  general administrative expense as a percentage of sales would have been in this increase in is attributable to increased environmental expenses 
the improvement in fiscal was attributable primarily to administrative efficiencies allowed by increased sales 
other income decreased million in as compared to  and increased million in as compared to these changes are due primarily to the fiscal sale of air rights over a portion of the property we own and are developing in farmingdale  new york 
in fiscal  we recorded million of restructuring charges 
of this amount  million was recorded at our corporate office for severance benefits and million was recorded at our aerospace distribution segment for the write off of building improvements from premises vacated 
the remaining million was recorded as a result of the kaynar technologies merger integration process at our aerospace fasteners segment for severance benefits  product integration expenses incurred as of june   and the write down of redundant fixed assets 
as of june   approximately one third of the integration process has been executed 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges for product integration costs during the next twelve months at our aerospace fasteners segment 
we anticipate that our integration process will be substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal we reported an operating loss of million in fiscal which was a decrease from operating income of million reported in fiscal the current year was affected by million of expenses recognized for inventory impairment  restructuring and costs related to acquisitions 
operating income of million in fiscal increased million  or  compared to operating income of million in fiscal the increase in operating income was due primarily to the improved results in our aerospace fasteners segment 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decreases were due to a series of transactions occurring in fiscal that significantly reduced our total debt 
we expect interest expense to increase significantly in the next year as a result of additional debt we incurred to finance the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
investment income loss  net  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we recognized a large gain in from the liquidation of our position in alliedsignal to raise funds to acquire kaynar technologies 
the decrease in was due to recognition of unrealized losses on the fair market adjustments of investments previously classified as trading securities in the fiscal periods  while recording unrealized gains from trading securities in the fiscal periods 
unrealized holding gains losses on available for sale investments are marked to market value through stockholders equity and reported separately as part of comprehensive income 
nonrecurring income of million in resulted from the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group 
nonrecurring income in included the million gain from the sale of scandinavian bellyloading company 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal representing a effective tax rate on pre tax losses from continuing operations 
the tax benefit approximates the statutory rate 
the income tax provision of million reported in fiscal represents a effective tax rate on pre tax earnings from continuing operations excluding equity in earnings of affiliates and minority interest of million 
the tax provision was slightly higher than the statutory rate because of goodwill associated with the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
income taxes included a million tax benefit in fiscal on a pre tax loss of million from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased million in  compared to  and million in  compared to the decreases are primarily attributable to losses recorded by small start up ventures 
in july  we divested our interest in nacanco 
this will likely reduce our future equity earnings 
minority interest decreased by million in and increased by million in as a result of the million nonrecurring pre tax gain recognized in from the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group 
on april   we completed a merger with banner aerospace  which will effectively reduce our future minority interest effects to immaterial amounts 
included in earnings loss from discontinued operations are the results of fairchild technologies through january  and our equity in earnings of shared technologies fairchild prior to the merger of shared technologies fairchild 
losses increased in fiscal as a result of increased losses recorded at fairchild technologies and lower equity earnings contributed by shared technologies fairchild 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we recorded a million gain  net of tax  on disposal of discontinued operations  from the proceeds received from the merger of shared technologies fairchild 
this gain was partially offset in connection with the adoption of a formal plan to enhance the opportunities for disposition of fairchild technologies 
under this plan we recorded an after tax charge of million and million on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
included in the fiscal charge  was million net of an income tax benefit of million for the net losses of fairchild technologies through june  and million net of an income tax benefit of million for the estimated operating losses of fairchild technologies 
the fiscal after tax operating loss from fairchild technologies exceeded the june estimate recorded for expected losses by million net of an income tax benefit of million through june an additional after tax charge of million net of an income tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal  based on a current estimate of the remaining losses in connection with the disposition of fairchild technologies 
while we believe that million is a reasonable charge for the remaining losses to be incurred from fairchild technologies  there can be no assurance that this estimate is adequate 
in fiscal  we recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  to write off the remaining deferred loan fees associated with the early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant to our acquisition of kaynar technologies see note 
in fiscal we recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  to write off the remaining deferred loan fees and original issue discounts associated with early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant the repayment of all our public debt and refinancing of credit facilities 
comprehensive income loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available for sale investment securities 
the fair market value of unrealized holding securities declined by million in fiscal and increased by million in the changes reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments  primarily alliedsignal common stock 
the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the value of alliedsignal common stock which we received from the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group 
foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
segment results aerospace fasteners segment sales in the aerospace fasteners segment increased by million to million  up in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting growth due primarily to the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
new orders stabilized in reflecting a plateau during fiscal and ultimately a slight downturn in the commercial aerospace industry in the fourth quarter of fiscal backlog increased by million in fiscal to million at june   reflecting the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
excluding million of backlog contributed by kaynar technologies  our backlog decreased million 
sales in the aerospace fasteners segment increased by million to million  up in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting growth in the commercial aerospace industry combined with the effect of acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis reflecting acquisitions in comparable periods  sales decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal operating income increased by million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal included in our results are restructuring charges of million for integration costs and severance from the integration of our business with the kaynar technologies business 
excluding restructuring charges  operating income increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding restructuring charges  internal growth was in fiscal at operations we owned entirely during the period  compared to the fiscal results of these same operations on a pro forma basis 
operating income improved by million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal acquisitions and marketing changes were contributing factors to the fiscal improvement 
we anticipate that cost savings resulting from the manufacturing integration of the kaynar technologies business with our own business will further improve operating results in fiscal on a pro forma basis  operating income decreased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and increased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we believe the demand for aerospace fasteners in fiscal will remain relatively high in europe  and expect sluggish demand in the united states 
we anticipate that order rates may start increasing again during the ladder part of fiscal in the meantime  we believe production volume on a worldwide basis will remain at reasonable levels 
we expect that our merger integration savings and production efficiency improvements will allow us to generate an increase in margin 
aerospace distribution segment sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by million  or  in fiscal  compared to the fiscal period  due primarily to the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of the hardware group and solair 
sales decreased by million  or in fiscal  compared to fiscal the exclusion of six months revenues as a result of the hardware group disposition was responsible primarily for the decrease in  in which sales otherwise reflected a robust aerospace industry 
on a twelve month pro forma basis  sales decreased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to operating income decreased by million  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal a charge of million is included in the current year results  in connection with the sale of solair and the potential sale of dallas aerospace 
excluding these charges  operating income would have decreased million in fiscal  compared to the same period of the prior year  due primarily to the disposition of solair and the hardware group 
operating income decreased million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the hardware group disposition 
on a twelve month pro forma basis  operating income decreased million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and was stable in fiscal compared to fiscal corporate and other the corporate and other classification includes the gas springs division and corporate activities 
the group reported an improvement in sales in fiscal  compared to fiscal an operating loss of million in fiscal was million higher than the operating loss of million reported in fiscal the current year includes million of one time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of kaynar technologies  restructuring charges  and increased environmental  legal and travel expenses 
also  the prior year included other income of million  including million realized as a result of the condemnation of air rights over a portion of the property we own and are developing in farmingdale  new york 
the group reported a decrease in sales of million  in  as compared to  due to the exclusion of fairchild scandinavian bellyloading results in fiscal the operating loss decreased by million in  compared to fiscal  as a result of an increase in other income and a decrease in legal expenses 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total capitalization as of june  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the changes in capitalization included an increase of million in debt and a decrease of million in equity 
the increase in debt was a result of the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
the decrease in equity was due primarily to a million purchase of treasury stock  the million reported loss  and a million change in cumulative other comprehensive income  offset partially by the issuance of million of our class a common stock resulting from the merger with banner aerospace 
we maintain a portfolio of investments classified primarily as available for sale securities  which had a fair market value of million at june  the market value of these investments decreased million in due primarily to the liquidation of investments in which investment income of million was realized 
while there is risk associated with market fluctuations inherent in stock investments  and because our portfolio it not diversified  large swings in its value should be expected 
in  we liquidated substantially all of our alliedsignal common stock  using the proceeds therefrom in connection with the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
in fiscal  we sold approximately million shares of alliedsignal common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
we have an acre site in farmingdale  new york  of which we are developing as a shopping center 
we have invested cash and interest of approximately million  million and million into this project in  and  respectively 
we estimate funding of approximately million is needed to complete this project 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million 
the primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal was an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities of million  partially offset by our net loss and non cash adjustments of million 
net cash used for operating activities for fiscal was million 
the primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal was a million increase in inventories 
net cash used for investing activities for fiscal was million and included million used for acquisitions  partially offset by million received from the liquidation of investments 
net cash provided from investing activities for fiscal was million and included proceeds received from the disposition of discontinued operations  including shared technologies fairchild  of million 
this was slightly offset by cash used for the acquisition of subsidiaries and minority interests of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal included the issuance of additional debt of million offset partially by million of debt repayments and million of treasury stock purchased 
we increased our debt in fiscal  as a result of the acquistion of kaynar technologies 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal included the issuance million of stock from our equity offering and million from the issuance of additional debt partially offset by the repayment of debt and the repurchase of debentures of million 
our principal cash requirements include debt service  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and payment of other liabilities 
other liabilities that require the use of cash include postretirement benefits  environmental investigation and remediation obligations  real estate development  and litigation settlements and related costs 
we expect that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash from borrowings and asset sales will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements in fiscal discontinued operations in fiscal   and  fairchild technologies had pre tax operating losses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  as a result of the downturn in the asian markets  fairchild technologies experienced delivery deferrals  reduction in new orders  lower margins and increased price competition 
in response  in february  we adopted a formal plan for the disposition of fairchild technologies 
the plan called for a reduction in production capacity and headcount at fairchild technologies and the pursuit of potential vertical and horizontal integration with peers and competitors of the two divisions that constitute fairchild technologies 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we liquidated a significant portion of fairchild technologies mostly consisting of our semiconductor equipment group through several transactions 
on april   we disposed of our photoresist deep ultraviolet track equipment machines  spare parts and testing equipment to apex co  ltd 
in exchange for  shares of apex stock valued at approximately million 
on june   we received million from suess microtec ag and the right to receive  shares of suess microtec stock or approximately million by june in exchange for all of the fixed assets and inventory of fairchild technologies seg gmbh and certain intellectual property 
on may   we sold fairchild cdi for a nominal amount 
subsequent to june   we received approximately million from novellus in exchange for our low k dielectric product line and certain intellectual property 
we are also exploring several alternative transactions regarding the fairchild technologies optical disc equipment group business  but we have not made any definitive arrangement for its ultimate disposition 
uncertainty of the spin off in order to focus our operations on the aerospace industry  we have been considering for some time distributing to our stockholders certain of our assets via distribution of all of the stock of a new entity  which may own all or a substantial part of our non aerospace operations 
we are still in the process of deciding the exact composition of the assets and liabilities to be included in the spin off  but such assets would be likely to include certain real estate interests 
our ability to consummate the spin off  if we should choose to do so  would be contingent  among other things  on attaining certain milestones under our credit facility  or waivers thereof  and all necessary governmental and third party approvals 
there is no assurance that we will be able to reach such milestones or obtain the necessary waivers from our lenders 
in addition  we may encounter unexpected delays in effecting the spin off  and we can make no assurance as to the timing thereof  or as to whether the spin off will ever occur 
depending on the ultimate structure and timing of the spin off  it may be a taxable transaction to our stockholders and could result in a material tax liability to us as well as our stockholders 
the amount of the tax to us is uncertain  and if the tax is material to us  we may elect not to consummate the spin off 
because circumstances may change and provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  may be further amended from time to time  we may  depending on various factors  restructure or delay the timing of the spin off to minimize the tax consequences to us and our stockholders  or elect not to consummate the spin off 
under the spin off  it is expected that that the newly created entity may assume certain of our liabilities  including contingent liabilities  and may indemnify us for such liabilities 
in the event this entity is unable to satisfy the liabilities  which it will assume in connection with the spin off  we may have to satisfy such liabilities 
year as the end of the century nears  there is a widespread concern that many existing data processing devices that use only the last two digits to refer to a year will not properly recognize a year that begins with the digits instead of if not properly modified  these data processing devices could fail  create erroneous results  or cause unanticipated systems failures  among other problems 
in response  we have developed a worldwide year readiness plan that is divided into a number of interrelated and overlapping phases 
these phases include corporate awareness and planning  readiness assessment  evaluation and prioritization of solutions  implementation of remediation  validation testing  and contingency planning 
each is discussed below 
awareness 
in the corporate awareness and planning phase  we formed a year project group under the direction of our chief financial officer and chief information officer  identified and designated key personnel within the company to coordinate our year efforts  and retained the services of outside technical review and modification consultants 
the project group prepared an overall schedule and working budget for our year plan 
we have completed this phase of our year plan 
we evaluate our information technology applications regularly  and based on such evaluation revise the schedule and budget to reflect the progress of our year readiness efforts 
the chief financial officer and chief information officer regularly report to our management and to our audit committee on the status of the year project 
assessment 
in the readiness assessment phase  we  in coordination with our technical review consultants  have been evaluating our year preparedness in a number of areas  including our information technology infrastructure  external resources  physical plant and production facilities  equipment and machinery  products and inventory 
we have completed this phase of our year plan 
pending the completion of all validation testing  we continue to review on a regular basis all aspects of our year preparedness 
in this respect  we have designated officers at each of our business segments to provide regular assessment updates to our chief information officer and outside consultants  who have assimilated a range of alternative methods to complete each phase of our year plan and are reporting regularly their findings and conclusions to our management 
evaluation 
in the evaluation and prioritization of solutions phase  we seek to develop potential solutions to the year issues identified in our readiness assessment phase  consider those solutions in light of our other information technology and business priorities  prioritize the various remediation tasks  and develop an implementation schedule 
this phase is largely complete 
however  we will continue to evaluate our year readiness status through november   when all validation testing is anticipated to be complete 
however  identified problems will be corrected as soon as practicable after identification 
to date  we have not identified any major information technology system or non information technology system that must be replaced in its entirety for year reasons 
we have also determined that most of the year issues identified in the assessment phase can be addressed satisfactorily through system modifications  component upgrades and software patches 
thus  we do not presently anticipate incurring any material systems replacement costs relating to the year issues 
implementation 
in the implementation of remediation phase  we  with the assistance of our technical review and modification consultants  began to implement the proposed solutions to any identified year issues 
the solutions include equipment and component upgrades  systems and software patches  reprogramming and resetting machines  and other modifications 
substantially all of the material systems within the aerospace fasteners and aerospace distribution segments of our business are currently year ready 
however  we are continuing to evaluate and implement year modifications to embedded data processing technology in certain manufacturing equipment used in our aerospace fasteners segment 
testing 
in the validation testing phase  we seek to evaluate and confirm the results of our year remediation efforts 
in conducting our validation testing  we are using  among other things  proprietary testing protocols developed internally and by our technical review and modification consultants  as well as testing tools such as greenwich mean time s check and sematech s year readiness testing scenarios version the greenwich tools identify potential year related software and data problems  and the sematech protocols validate the ability of data processing systems to rollover and hold transition dates 
testing for both the aerospace fasteners segment and the aerospace distribution segment is approximately percent complete 
to date  the results of our validation testing have not revealed any new and significant year issues or any ineffective remediation 
we have completed testing of our most critical information technology and related systems 
contingency planning 
in the contingency planning phase  we  together with our technical review consultants  are assessing the year readiness of our key suppliers  distributors  customers and service providers 
toward that objective  we have sent letters  questionnaires and surveys to our business partners  inquiring about their year readiness arrangements 
the average response rate has been approximately percent  including our most significant business partners have responded to our inquiries 
in this phase  we have evaluated the risks that our failure or the failure of others to be year ready would cause a material disruption to  or have a material effect on  our financial condition  business or operations 
so far  we have identified only our aerospace fasteners mrp system as being both mission critical and potentially at risk 
in mitigation of this concern  we have engaged a consultant to test  evaluate and implement the manufacturer designed year patches for the system 
we are also developing and evaluating contingency plans to deal with events arising from significant year issues outside of our infrastructure 
in this regard  we are considering the advisability of augmenting our inventories of certain raw materials and finished products  securing additional sources for certain supplies and services  arranging for back up utilities  and exploring alternate distribution and sales channels  among other things

in thousands year costs anticipated year as of costs june  during the next six months aerospace fasteners aerospace distribution we have funded the costs of our year plan from general operating funds  and all such costs have been deducted from income 
to date  the costs associated with our year efforts have not had a material effect on  and have caused no delays with respect to  our other information technology programs or projects 
we anticipate that we will complete our year preparations by november  although our year implementation  testing and contingency planning phases are not yet complete  we do not currently believe that year issues will materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  in some international markets in which we conduct business  the level of awareness and remediation efforts by third parties  utilities and infrastructure managers relating to the year issue may be less advanced than in the united states  which could  despite our efforts  have an adverse effect on us

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
the corresponding derivative gains or losses are reported based on the hedge relationship that exists  if any 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria in sfas  are required to be reported in earnings 
most of the general qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under sfas were derived from  and are similar to  the existing qualifying criteria in sfas accounting for futures contracts 
sfas describes three primary types of hedge relationships fair value hedge  cash flow hedge  and foreign currency hedge 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
to defer the required effective date of implementing sfas from fiscal years beginning after june  to fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas in fiscal and we are currently evaluating the financial statement impact
