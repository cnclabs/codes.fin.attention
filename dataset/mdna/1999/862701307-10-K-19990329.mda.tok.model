due to the contingent nature of the earn out  no benefit was recognized related to this portion of the consideration 
in the second quarter of  the company recorded a  charge to loss on sale of discontinued operations  which included estimated losses of atsg through the date of sale and the write off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale 
results of operations the following table of revenues and percentages sets forth selected items of the results of operations 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues    cost of materials operating wages and benefits other operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses acquired in process research and development operating loss interest income  net loss from continuing operations before taxes income tax expense loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations loss on sale of discontinued operations net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  in this growth resulted primarily from the implementation of new in plant store facilities and growth of existing in plant store facilities 
the number of in plant store facilities increased from at december  to at december  one in plant store customer represented approximately of revenues for the year ended december   but less than for the year ended december  cost of materials as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to in the company was able to leverage its expanding purchasing power  resulting in lower material costs sold to in plant store customers 
operating wages and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from in this decrease is primarily a result of the percentage of revenues from more mature in plant store facilities as compared to the percentage of revenues from new in plant store facilities being greater for the year ended december  than in as new in plant store facilities are added  operating wages and benefits will continue to increase 
however these expenses as a percentage of revenues will vary depending on the rate at which the company adds new in plant store facilities 
during the start up phase of new facilities  these expenses generally increase at a higher rate than revenues are recognized 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from in the decrease reflects utilization of improved software technology at intermat to increase productivity and lower temporary labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained at for the year ended december  lower selling  general and administrative expense spending as a percent of revenue was offset by asset write offs associated with the bankruptcy of one in plant store customer and an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts 
as the in plant store program expands  this expense will continue to increase  however  as a percentage of revenue  it should decrease as the ratio of more mature in plant store facilities to new facilities increases 
in  the company incurred a non recurring charge of  for acquired in process research and development ipr d in connection with the acquisition of intermat see also year ended december  compared to year ended december  
as of december   the company had spent approximately  on the ipr d projects  with an additional  expected to be spent in the first half of to complete expansion and refinement of structured parts descriptions for the data redevelopment project 
the two ipr d projects completed for have received market acceptance and have delivered the expected improvements in operating efficiency  including decreased utilization of temporary labor at intermat  which decrease has helped to reduce the company s other operating expenses as described above 
interest income  net decreased by  to  for the year ended december  when compared with interest income  net of  in the decrease resulted primarily from the use of cash and cash equivalents to finance the working capital requirements of new in plant store facilities and for capital expenditures  thereby reducing the funds available to earn interest income 
an income tax benefit was not recorded for the loss incurred in the year ended december   as the company did not believe there was a sufficient basis for benefit recognition 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  in  as a result of the items previously discussed 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  in this growth resulted primarily from the implementation of new in plant store facilities  growth of existing in plant store facilities and the acquisition of intermat 
the number of in plant store facilities increased from at december  to at december  one in plant store customer with which the company operated under six separate contracts represented approximately and of the revenues for the years ended december  and cost of materials as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to in this decrease is a result of intermat having a lower cost of materials  as a percentage of revenues  than isa 
the decrease was partly offset by a higher cost of materials for isa because of a change in product mix to in plant store facilities 
this percentage may vary depending on the relative sales of the two subsidiaries 
operating wages and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from in this decrease is primarily a result of the percentage of revenues from more mature in plant store facilities as compared to the percentage of revenues from new in plant store facilities being greater for the year ended december  than in as new in plant store facilities are added  operating wages and benefits will continue to increase 
however these expenses as a percentage of revenues will vary depending on the rate at which the company adds new in plant store facilities 
during the start up phase of new facilities  these expenses generally increase at a higher rate than revenues are recognized 
the inclusion of intermat s results of operations  which reflect a higher percentage of these expenses than in plant store operations  partly offset the overall percentage decrease 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from in this increase resulted primarily from the inclusion of intermat s results of operations  which reflect a much higher percentage of these expenses than in plant store operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from in isa s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased as compared to  reflecting a higher mix of revenues in from more mature in plant store facilities versus new in plant store facilities  than in as the in plant store program expands  this expense will continue to increase  however  as a percentage of revenue  it should decrease as the ratio of more mature in plant store facilities to new facilities increases

in  the company incurred a non recurring charge of  for ipr d in connection with the acquisition of intermat 
as of the acquisition date january   intermat was working on three projects  involving major new enhancements and technological extensions necessary to compete in the marketplace definity client server  autocon ii  and smd ii 
the definity client server project consisted of the development of a windows client server based version of the functionality that existed in intermat s dos based definity product 
this product allows the company and its clients to develop and maintain catalogs and part descriptions 
autocon ii represented a complete re development of an existing dos based application 
autocon is a process to perform the efficient conversion of client source data to identify and extract nouns  modifiers and characteristic values in accordance with the standard modifier dictionary smd 
the third project  smd ii  involved the expansion and refinement of intermat s electronic dictionary of structured parts descriptions 
the three projects were designed to provide the resources for substantially all of the company s data management services 
the definity client server and autocon ii projects required intermat to develop an entirely new skills base  both in the development environment and in client server technology 
as of the acquisition date  key elements that existed for these two projects were a proven methodology and an extensive rules base that captured years of knowledge of cataloging and automated conversion 
also as of the acquisition date  the complete re design of the database structure was nearing completion 
however  at that time intermat had still not proven that the technology could be migrated from a desktop environment to client server 
remaining to be accomplished were the primary tasks of migrating the database to oracle and microsoft sqlserver  and the task of creating the interdependence across the projects that would be required to make extensive improvements in the value association component of the software 
the smdii project differed from the others in that it involved data  rather than software development 
it involved an electronic dictionary containing thousands of formats for structured parts descriptions 
the market for materials search environments had evolved to the use of more structured data 
this change gave rise to the need to re develop the formats to optimize their use in these developing environments  most notably enterprise resource planning erp system vendors and reference database solution providers 
as of the acquisition date  these projects were anticipated to be completed by december  with the benefits from the projects expected to begin in the first quarter of the projected cost to complete the projects was estimated to be approximately  the two client server based projects were substantially completed at december  during  management observed that some of the pressure that was being felt in the marketplace in late for alternative formats had eased  which allowed the company to extend the completion date for the data redevelopment project without significant additional risk 
the ipr d projects and their timely completion were critical factors for the company in acquiring intermat 
on time completion was expected to give the company a competitive edge in its field 
risks of not completing these projects on time included the potential loss of key customers to competitors that developed their own solutions 
the company arrived at the ipr d valuation based upon a number of assumptions 
material net cash inflows were projected to begin in revenues and the resulting cash inflows were projected for nine years for valuation purposes 
a weighted average cost of capital wacc of was calculated for intermat reflecting its business risk 
revenue and profitability assumptions reflected the positive effects of the year issue and corporations spending more on new compliant erp systems and tools  as well as the negative impact of future competition 
interest income  net for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in during  the company had more funds available for investment  but for fewer months than in  primarily from the sale of  shares of common stock on may  during  a portion of the net proceeds from the stock sale were used to finance the working capital requirements of new in plant store facilities and the acquisition of intermat 
an income tax benefit was not recorded for the loss incurred in the year ended december   as the company did not believe there was a sufficient basis for benefit recognition 
results of discontinued operations relate to ssi and atsg and are discussed above 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  in  as a result of the items previously discussed 
liquidity and capital resources effective as of may   the company entered into a revolving loan and security agreement the credit facility with its bank  providing maximum borrowings of  borrowings bear interest at the bank s reference rate as of december  and or a eurodollar rate  with a commitment fee during the term of the agreement which ranges from to per annum on the unused portion of the credit available 
the credit facility expires on may  the amount that the company may borrow under the credit facility is based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit facility contains customary financial and other covenants and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets  as well as the pledge of the capital stock  of the company s subsidiaries 
as of december   there was  of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
borrowings under the facility are expected to be used primarily to fund working capital requirements for the expansion of the in plant store program 
on may   the company sold  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the net proceeds to the company were  a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the company s bank indebtedness 
the balance of the net proceeds at that time  was available for working capital  including the opening of in plant store facilities  for general corporate purposes and for possible acquisitions 
on january   the company completed the acquisition of intermat for a purchase price consisting of  in cash  a  subordinated note and  newly issued shares of common stock 
on june   the company sold substantially all of the assets and business of ssi 
consideration for the sale consisted of  in cash  promissory notes in the aggregate amount of  as adjusted  and an earn out contingent payment  which could result in additional compensation to the company 
excluded from the sale were accounts receivable of  which were substantially collected in on june   the company sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of atsg 
consideration for the sale consisted of  in cash  with a final adjustment based on collected accounts receivable to be determined 
the sale agreement also provides for an earn out contingent payment  which could result in additional compensation to the company 
the net cash used in continuing operations was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable and inventories  which were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in short term investments 
accounts receivable and inventories increased primarily from the increase in the number of in plant store facilities 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily from higher inventory levels 
the change in net assets of discontinued operations was a decrease of  for the year ended december  compared to a decrease of  for the decrease was primarily related to the collection of accounts receivable in connection with the sale and wind down of the business operations of atsg 
the decrease was primarily related to the collection of accounts receivable excluded from the sale of ssi 
the net cash used in investing activities increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period in the net use in resulted primarily from expenditures related to computer systems and equipment  partially offset by the sale of atsg 
the net use in resulted primarily from the acquisition of intermat and expenditures related to computer systems and equipment  partially offset by the sale of ssi 
the net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  in  cash was provided primarily from the company s new credit facility 
in  cash was provided primarily from the sale of stock to an officer of the company and the exercise of stock options 
the company is in the process of implementing a resystemization of its operating and financial data processing systems  referred to as in site tm 
during  central system hardware and software was acquired and development of the operating and financial systems commenced 
financial systems were operational effective january  development of the operating systems is expected to be complete early in the second quarter of communications installations  acquisition of additional hardware  deployment of the operating systems to the company s in plant store sites and integration with the financial systems is expected to be complete by the end of during  the company expended  on capital additions for the in site project 
recruiting  training  data conversion and other miscellaneous costs directly related to the project amounting to  were expensed as incurred 
at december   the total estimated additional capital spending to complete this project was expected to be approximately  the company believes that cash on hand  cash generated from future operations  and cash from the company s new bank credit facility will generate sufficient funds to permit the company to support the anticipated expansion of the in plant store program and completion of the in site project 
year issue the year issue arises from the fact that many existing computer software programs use only two digits to identify the year in date fields and  as such  could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company s state of readiness in late  the company began a planned project to replace its operating and financial data processing systems  in order to provide better access to business information  to meet the service requirements of its customers and to allow for the expansion of its in plant store program 
this initiative is using year compliant software 
the system replacement project is currently on schedule 
financial systems were operational effective january  development of the operating systems is expected to be complete early in the second quarter of communications installations  acquisition of additional hardware  deployment of the operating systems to the company s in plant store sites and integration with the financial systems is expected to be complete by the end of  primarily during the second and third quarter 
in addition to the systems replacement project  the company is in the process of evaluating year compliance for its computer hardware  its non technology systems and for major third parties with which the company conducts business 
computer hardware testing was substantially complete as of september  the company used the ymark test to assist in its evaluation 
hardware requiring replacement or upgrade is expected to be completed in a timeframe consistent with the deployment of its in site operating systems 
the company has no buildings or other fixed plant with embedded technology and is not highly dependent on its own non technology systems 
the company commenced identification and testing in the third quarter of and expects to complete its evaluation and remediation  if necessary  by june  as of december   the company had not found any major non technology system under its control to be year deficient and the company does not believe that any of these systems create material risks for the company 
the company s in plant stores are located at its customers industrial sites  the company leases office space from third parties and the company relies on its suppliers and its telecommunications links to conduct business 
the company is in the process of contacting each of its customers and lessors to determine their year readiness 
the company expects to complete this process by june  and has found no significant year issues to date 
the company surveyed its top suppliers covering in excess of of the company s purchases in the fourth quarter of and believes they will be able to continue to supply the company with mro parts into the year the company expects to complete a survey of its remaining suppliers by june   with particular emphasis on existing single source suppliers 
the company has contacted its telecommunications providers and has been advised that their systems are year compliant 
the costs to address the company s year issues costs associated with the company s year compliance effort  which exclude its planned systems replacement project  are not expected to be material 
upgrade or replacement of year deficient computers will be completed during salaries  benefits and other costs of the company s personnel evaluating its year readiness have not been measured and have been expensed as incurred 
the risks of the company s year issues failure to identify and correct year problems could result in interruptions in  or failures of  certain normal business activities 
factors that could cause or contribute to such failures include  but are not limited to  failure to complete the company s systems replacement project as scheduled  inability to procure critical parts from suppliers  telecommunications failures  and plant shutdowns related to year problems with customer systems 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s contingency plans the company performed year compliance testing on its existing in plant store operating system and believes the system to be year compliant 
therefore  the company expects to be able to use this system in the event of a delay in the systems replacement project 
the company is in the process of identifying single source suppliers that may not be year compliant and  where necessary  developing alternative supply sources and expects to have this plan completed by june  no manufacturer or supplier provides products that account for as much as of the company s revenues and the company believes that it could quickly find alternative sources of supply 
with customer agreement  increases in inventory may also be considered if no alternate source can be developed 
the company s telecommunications network combines the use of dedicated lines and a data exchange network provided by a national telecommunications company 
in the event of a failure in a segment of its telecommunications network the company has the ability to transfer data using standard modem technology 
the company believes business interruptions resulting from failures of its customers systems are beyond its control 
the company believes that its efforts to ensure year readiness  in conjunction with its systems replacement project  will significantly reduce the risk associated with year systems failures 
however  due primarily to uncertainties surrounding the year readiness of third parties  there can be no assurance that year systems failures will not occur 
inflation the company believes that any impact of general inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
the company s current policy is to attempt to reduce any impact of inflation through price increases and cost reductions 
seasonality the company does not believe that its business is seasonal in nature
