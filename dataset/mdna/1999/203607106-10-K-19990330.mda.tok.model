item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of the company 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set forth herein under the caption forward looking statements 
the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
net income and profitability net income and diluted earnings per share reached record highs in at million and  respectively 
compared to  net income rose while earnings per share were up 
the return on equity roe decreased percentage points from the prior year to 
tangible or cash roe was off a lesser basis points to  placing the company s performance nearly in the top quartile of its regional peer banks 
recurring or core earnings were up 
from last year to million after removing the impact of one time income and expense items 
net gains losses on the sale of investment securities are taken when economically justified by total return analysis as discussed in the investments section of this document  and as such are considered a component of core earnings 
s core net income climbed over the prior year to million 
these results reflect the fifth consecutive year in which acquisitions had an important impact on the company s results 
their role is noted among the primary factors explaining s improvement in net income as follows o net interest income full tax equivalent basis increased or million due to a significant increase in earning asset levels 
average loans grew million while average investments grew million 
during the last twelve months  loans increased by million or 
over of this growth took place in the markets served by the branches net of three divestitures purchased from chase manhattan bank at mid year about of s growth was due to the contributions of branches acquired in mid from key bank  na and fleet bank 
the growth in earning assets was funded by million more in average deposits  resulting largely from the aforementioned acquisitions offset by reduced borrowings 
the increase in net interest income came despite a net interest margin of  basis points lower than the level due to the impact of a flat treasury yield curve on margins in general and a reduction in the investment portfolio yield in particular 
a key factor influencing the latter was an acceleration in the amortization of premiums on certain of the company s collateralized mortgage obligations cmos triggered by unusually high mortgage refinancing activity nationwide 
o total noninterest income including  in investment gains on securities sold upon adoption of financial accounting standard increased by over to million 
half of the increase was caused by higher non recurring income and a quarter was attributable to more service charges and overdraft fees generated from fee schedule changes 
the balance of the increase largely reflects the full year impact of the mid key and fleet acquisitions 
nearly three quarters of the non recurring income figure represented million in gains taken on million in investment sales 
approximately  of these gains was offset by losses on the sale of various acquired branch properties 
o noninterest expense or overhead rose million or in compared to million or in the bulk of the and increases was caused by the impact of the mid key and fleet branch acquisitions 
this branch expansion caused personnel additions due to both acquired branch staff as well as operations positions to process higher transaction volumes  greater other costs to service the expanded customer base  and higher amortization of deposit intangibles 
besides the full year impact of these expenses  approximately  in one time expenses was incurred this year to dispose of acquired branch properties 
o loan loss provision expense rose  or over s level 
because of lower than expected charge offs on acquired key and fleet loans and a sufficient loss reserve pertaining to all other loans  every dollar of net charge offs was covered by a single dollar of provision in versus the historical times coverage 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans increased slightly over to a relatively high  but steady improvement during the year in installment loan charge offs brought this ratio down to 
in the fourth quarter from a high of 
one year earlier 
nonperforming loans decreased during to a satisfactory 
of loans outstanding at year end 
the above combination of factors resulted in a level of profitability which may be compared to that of cbsi s peer bank holding companies  this group is comprised of companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets based on data through september  the most recently available disclosure as provided by the federal reserve system 
through year to date september  net income per dollar employed  or return on average assets  was  compared to the peer norm of 
shareholder return on equity roe at for the same period ranked much closer to the peer norm of  placing it in the th peer percentile 
the company s primary performance focus is on achieving returns to shareholders  which is best measured by roe 
underlying the growth in earnings per share was steady improvement on a quarterly basis 
the first three quarters of at  
and 
per share exceeded the same quarters by   and  respectively 
fourth quarter earnings per share were off 
from the same period in part due to the previously mentioned write down of  on leases and fixed assets of former acquired branch properties no longer in use 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per common share percentage of average shareholder s equity to average total assets cash adjusted earnings and profitability many analysts consider that a better measure of the economic value of an acquisition are the cash earnings that it generates  which is determined by adding back to reported earnings the after tax expense of amortizing the acquisition premium 
over the last five years  growth has been consistently greater in cash earnings than in reported earnings due to the company s regular program of branch acquisitions 
cbsi s cash earnings increased in to million compared to growth in and in cash basis earnings per share rose to in in contrast to a increase in reported diluted eps to 
last year s cash eps rose compared to on a reported basis  while cash eps was up in versus on a reported basis 
return on assets is also significantly higher on a cash basis  being   and in   and  respectively 
moreover  performance measured by tangible or cash return on equity was in as compared to in and in net interest income net interest income is the company s primary source of core operating income for payment of overhead and possible loan losses 
it is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors as well as interest on borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york and dividends on the company s million in trust preferred stock 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
net interest income with non taxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase from the prior year 
the increase was entirely due to higher earning asset volumes  which had a positive impact on net interest income of million  while interest rate changes had a negative impact of million 
with regard to the components of s net interest income  greater average earning assets of million helped contribute to the million or rise in interest income 
a total of million in s increased average earning assets resulted from a greater level of lending activity in existing markets and the impact of loans initially acquired with the key and fleet branches 
the average ratio of loans to earning assets increased from in to in as a consequence of the aforementioned acquisitions  strong business development efforts and slower growth in investments 
overall interest and fees on loans grew million or as a result of loan growth and came despite a basis point bp decrease in loan yields to caused by declining market rates 
through september   the company s loan yield was in the favorable st peer bank percentile 
the remaining million of growth in earning assets is explained by an increase in average investments outstanding  this primarily reflects the full year impact of investments purchased in both for the strategic use of leveraging when favorable buying opportunities existed and the impact of investments purchased from funds provided by s branch acquisitions 
it should be noted that from year end to year end  investments were down million 
the investment interest income was million or lower than a year earlier due to the reduction in average investment yield from to  interest income from higher outstandings offset a portion of the million reduction due to lower rates 
this reduction was caused by declining market rates  including the negative impact of historically high mortgage refinancing nationwide on the value of the company s premium collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
despite this decline  the company s investment yield was in the favorable th peer bank percentile based on data through september  the average earning asset yield fell basis points to because of the falling treasury yield curve directly affecting new investment rates and cmo yields and creating downward pressure on new loan rates  partially offset by an increased mix of loans to earning assets most types of loans have historically had higher yields than marketable securities 
total average fundings deposits and borrowings grew by million in attributable to the full year impact of s acquired deposits  causing a million increase in total interest expense 
virtually all of this additional expense is due to interest paid on time deposits  which was particularly influenced by the key and fleet acquisitions  both of which had relatively high mixes of time deposits 
the impact of higher funding volumes more than offset the benefit of the rate on interest bearing deposits falling bps to  due largely to across the board drops in deposit rates beginning in late summer and a bp lower borrowing rate reflecting declines in market rates 
overall  the average cost of funds as a percentage earning assets was reduced by bps to 
through september   the company s average cost of funds rate fell favorably to the th peer bank percentile  as compared to being in the th percentile through september  while the company s net interest margin has historically been very strong  the primary objective in recent years has been to maximize shareholder returns through active utilization of tangible capital 
thus  as management focuses on growing the earning asset base of the company  there has been a downward change in margin resulting in part from leverage strategies to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities and in part from a total return philosophy that may sacrifice current yield for greater cash earnings over a specified holding period 
an example of the latter strategy is taking investment gains though reinvestment yields are lower going forward 
this investment approach  as well as the reduction in value of premium cmos in  contributed to cbsi s net interest margin declining by basis points from in to this year 
also contributing to the decline was a lag in lowering deposit pricing compared to decreases in treasury rates 
for fourth quarter  the net interest margin was compared to one year earlier 
again  this can be attributed to a lower earning asset yield down bps at  partially offset by a bp lower rate on interest bearing liabilities at 
the company s net interest margin ranked in the th peer bank percentile through september   the first time it has not been well above the peer median in many years 
if securities gains are added to net interest income  the adjusted net interest margin for is versus the peer norm of

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are recurring fees from core banking and related operations and revenues from one time events  defined as net gains losses from the sale of investments  loans  and miscellaneous assets 
the faster growing components of recurring revenue are commissions from the sale of mutual fund and allied products  income from personal trust services  and related revenues from investment management  recordkeeping  and consulting services provided by benefit plans administrative services  inc bpa and the bank s employee benefit trust function ebt 
total noninterest income including  in investment gains on securities sold upon adoption of fas increased by to million from to  with half of the increase caused by higher non recurring income and a quarter of the increase attributable to more service charges and overdraft fees generated from fee schedule changes 
the balance of the increase reflects the full year impact of the mid key and fleet acquisitions 
core banking and related fees were up strongly for the fourth consecutive year to approximately million in  a million improvement following a increase in in addition to the full year benefits of the key and fleet acquisitions  fees from core banking and related operations improved in several key areas in o fees from personal trust services were million  up in as compared to a increase in the slower level of growth is primarily reflective of fewer estate settlement fees and lower levels of other less predictable fees 
the more consistent and recurring trust fees related to individual investment management accounts and annual trust administration together representing of the bank s personal trust income grew a combined 
continued focus on business development  including greater integration of financial service representatives and bpa as referral sources  is expected to strengthen future fiduciary income growth 
o service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees increased to million in  a growth rate compared to a growth rate in the and increases reflect the impact of fees and commissions from an expanded customer base gained from the key and fleet acquisitions and also significant changes in the bank s fee schedule effective in the spring of o fees earned through the company s visa affiliation rose in to  attributable to continued growth of the visa check card product  which almost doubled from to  and with visa merchant discount fees increasing 
the direct margin on merchant discount fees net of processing expense increased percentage points to in o is the fifth year in which cbsi has offered annuities  mutual funds  and other investment products through financial services representatives fsr s located in ten selected geographic markets within the bank s branch network 
commission income grew in to million on asset sales of million 
a greater emphasis continues to be placed on growing this line of special investment products as evidenced by the hiring of an experienced full time program manager early in o revenue from record keeping and consulting services provided by bpa acquired in july and investment management services provided by the pre existing ebt business totaled million in compared to million in  a increase resulting from continued business development efforts and origination fees earned upon conversion to a new mutual fund product offering 
o general commissions and miscellaneous income excluding visa related fees at million were up in this increase is attributable to  more in dividends earned from the sale of creditor life insurance products through a subsidiary of the new york state bankers association  and from the full year impact of miscellaneous fees generated by the former key and fleet branches  offset by a decrease in canadian exchange revenue 
non recurring income was million in including fas related securities gains as compared to  in approximately of the figure represents million in gains taken on million in investment sales  designed to both enhance portfolio total return as well as to improve the company s interest rate risk position through reinvestment of the proceeds or paying down borrowings 
additional gains resulted from  in gains on loans sold student loans and mortgages sold in the secondary market   in recognizing the value of the company s million mortgage servicing portfolio   in gain on life insurance and various other gains  offset by  in losses on the sale of former acquired branch properties 
the results included a  gain on life insurance and gains on secondary market mortgage loans sold 
recurring noninterest income as a percentage of total operating income increased percentage points during to 
since  the percentage has risen percentage points resulting from a focused effort to raise product revenues less susceptible to interest rate fluctuation 
further growth was recognized during fourth quarter as the ratio increased to compared to peers as of september   this ratio was in the th peer percentile  a significant improvement from the st percentile twelve months earlier 
in light of management s ongoing objective to grow noninterest income  opportunities to develop new fee based products are actively pursued and emphasis continues on the collection of fees including limitation on waived fees for providing quality service 
in  the bank will strive for continued growth in the sale of bpa ebt  personal trust  mutual fund further aided by the creation of a broker dealer subsidiary and secondary market mortgage products 
the full benefit of the fee restructuring which took effect during is expected to be realized as well as the opportunity beginning in first quarter to earn origination fees from the placement of commercial leases with a third party provider 
the following table sets forth selected information by category of noninterest income for the company for the years and quarters indicated 
years ended quarters ended s omitted december  december  personal trust income    mutual fund and related investment   products bpa ebt income    deposit service charges    overdraft fees    other service charges and fees    non recurring income  total      total non interest income excluding non recurring income as a percentage of operating income includes  of investment gains on securities sold upon adoption of fas noninterest expense noninterest expense or overhead rose million or in as compared to million or in the bulk of the and increases was caused by the impact of the mid key and fleet branch acquisitions 
this branch expansion caused personnel additions both acquired branch staff and volume sensitive positions in operations and other areas needed to support the expanded balance sheet  greater data processing requirements  higher facilities costs  increased amortization of deposit intangibles  and other expenses associated with servicing the expanded customer base 
as a percent of average assets  this year s overhead at increased slightly from in  however  the ratio remains in the peer normal th percentile 
for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for over of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs being up versus being higher in salary  benefit  and payroll tax expense primarily increased because of the full impact of staffing the new branches along with modest annual merit awards for all employees 
total full time equivalent staff at year end were versus at year end  down as the result of reorganizing job responsibilities so as to not replace turnover 
nonpersonnel expense rose million or this year as opposed to a million or increase in included in the increase was the one time write down of  in vacant former acquired properties not in use due to duplicate facilities within the same proximity  largely related to the key and fleet acquisitions 
in addition  higher expenses for occupancy  depreciation on equipment  telephone  courier  armored car  postage  business development  and computer services resulted from the full impact of the new branches added in mid  of which seven have been or are soon to be consolidated with other facilities 
total intangible amortization increased  or to million in as a result of the full impact of the branch acquisitions 
various other increases related to internal volume growth  expenses associated with repossessed assets  and price increases from selected vendors were partially offset by lower advertising and supplies caused by the lack of s acquired branch start up costs 
the efficiency ratio is defined at two levels the nominal ratio is total overhead expense divided by operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses 
the adjusted or recurring efficiency ratio excludes one time expense and intangible amortization as well as all one time noninterest income 
the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
in  the nominal efficiency ratio increased percentage points to  the recurring ratio increased percentage points to 
management believes it is more accurate to use the recurring ratio to compare to national norms  because most of its peer do not have intangible expense to the significance that cbsi has 
on that basis  cbsi s ratio is more favorable than the national peer bank holding company median of based on data available as of september  the primary reason for the softening in the efficiency ratios is the reduced increase in net interest income caused by a reduction in margin  exacerbated by the historically unprecedented accelerated amortization of premiums on certain of the company s cmo securities 
consistent with the bank s initial strategy for buying the cmos and corresponding with its total return philosophy  investment gains were taken to mitigate the accelerated amortization when the asset liability position could be improved with reinvestment of the cash flow or paydown of borrowings 
thus  if investment gains are included  the recurring efficiency ratio increased percentage points from in to in recurring non interest expense for fourth quarter was million   or higher than the same period 
both periods include the full impact of the mid acquisitions 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  management maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminating inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer comparisons  a bank wide program of employee involvement  and targeted use of outside consultants and review of productivity enhancing technology 
these combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from future price increases and higher transaction volumes and enable the company to more fully benefit from economies of scale as it continues to grow 
specifically  the bank will benefit more fully in from the spring installation of frame relay to lower the cost of data communications  the creation of a broker dealer subsidiary during first quarter to bring down the expense of delivering mutual funds and related products  the overhead savings following disposition of acquired branch properties in  and lower scheduled deposit intangible amortization 
the following table sets forth information by category of noninterest expenses of the company for the years and quarters indicated 
years ended quarters ended s omitted december  december  personnel expense      net occupancy expense    equipment expense    professional fees    data processing expense    amortization of intangibles     stationary and supplies   deposit insurance premiums other      total      total operating expenses as a percentage of average assets efficiency ratio nominal adjusted noninterest expense divided by operating income  excluding net securities gains losses 
noninterest expense excluding nonrecurring items and amortization of deposit intangibles divided by operating income excluding all nonrecurring items 
income and income taxes income before tax in  excluding the impact of fas accounting for selected securities gains  was million  up 
over the prior year s amount 
when income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxable on a federal basis  and all securities gains are stated on a pretax basis  s results rose by  or before tax 
largely as a result of the full year impact of s acquisitions  the main reasons for improved pretax earnings were the favorable million increase in net interest income full tax equivalent basis and a million climb in recurring noninterest income 
additionally  nonrecurring income rose million primarily as a result of gains taken in the investment portfolio 
these factors were partially offset by million more in overhead expense also related to the acquisitions  and  more in loan loss provision expense associated with higher net charge offs 
the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate rose a slight basis points this year to 
the increase resulted from certain adjustments in calculating federal tax liability  partially offset by a greater proportion of tax exempt municipal investment holdings which became more attractive than certain taxable securities in the present flat yield curve environment 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up over from one year earlier  primarily reflective of the contribution of earnings and the after tax market value adjustment mva of the bank s available for sale investments 
these capital inflows were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and million in cbsi common stock repurchased during the fall of in the open market  now held as treasury stock 
excluding the million after tax change in this year s mva  capital rose less than 
shares outstanding fell by over  during due to the repurchase of stock offset by the exercise of stock options 
on september   the company announced a stock repurchase program to acquire up to  of its shares 
the share repurchase program was intended to be accompanied by a reduction in the investment security portfolio  largely through run off due to anticipated prepayments and bond calls 
management s belief was that this was an opportune time to reduce the bank s reliance on earnings from the investment portfolio necessitated over the last several years by significant deposit growth via branch acquisitions  in addition  the share repurchase program had a more positive impact on earnings per share than investment spreads could offer 
through december    shares have been repurchased representing the aforementioned million in treasury stock 
whether the remaining  shares of the original board authorization is repurchased depends heavily on whether the company can maintain sufficient capital flexibility to move forward with its strategic growth plans  including possible acquisitions 
in addition  continued repurchase is dependent on whether the bank s volume of high cost liabilities can be lowered  whether investment spreads improve to make reinvestment of cash flows or leverage strategies more attractive  or whether additional shares are needed to accommodate the exercise of stock options 
despite the repurchase of stock  the ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  remains sound at 
this level compares to one year ago 
the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of as of year end was above the minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the company is confident that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth largely reflects a three cent per share increase in quarterly common stock dividend beginning in the third quarter of from 
to 
there were no dividends declared on preferred stock in as compared to  in the prior year  reflecting the redemption of the remaining preferred stock in january of raising the company s expected annualized dividend to per common share represents management s confidence that earnings strength is sustainable and that capital can be maintained at a satisfactory level 
the dividend payout ratio for the year was approximately  moving up from the levels of or excluding preferred dividends 
this is slightly higher than the company s targeted payout range for dividends on common stock of 
its payout ratio has historically been strong relative to peers  ranging from the th to th percentile from through  including preferred dividends 
the peer payout ratio remained high in the th peer percentile

additionally  the typical size loan to the variety of commercial businesses in the company s market areas is under  with only of the commercial portfolio consisting of loans in excess of  the portfolio contains no credit card receivables 
the overall yield on the portfolio is in the attractive st peer percentile 
loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  reached a record million as of year end  up over million or compared to twelve months earlier 
over of s growth took place in the markets served by the branches purchased from chase at mid year  outstandings at these branches have risen from million at the july acquisition date to million at year end about of s growth was due to the contributions of branches acquired in mid from key bank  na and fleet bank  with combined year end loans outstanding of million 
taken together  all acquired branch locations now account for approximately million in loans or of the company s year end loan base 
if approximately million in mortgages sold on the secondary market in were considered  loan growth could have been  marking the sixth consecutive year in which total loan growth including loans generated but not held in portfolio has exceeded 
the nature of lending table below recasts the company s loan portfolio into four major lines of business 
as previously discussed  much of the and loan growth relates to acquired branch locations and resulting market opportunities 
the increase in business lending accounted for of million in total loan growth in versus of s million increase 
on the other hand  a reduction in consumer direct loans lowered total growth by this year versus contributing of s growth 
consumer indirect loans accounted for of this year s increase  down from in the prior year 
lastly  the share of this year s total loan increase for consumer mortgages rose dramatically to from s level of 
the following more fully discusses the underlying reasons for these changes by each of the company s four major lending activities or lines of business 
nature of lending mix at quarter end million and total loans consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct year mil change mil total change mil total change mil total change mil total change the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
at million  this segment represents of loans outstanding at year end  having steadily expanded its share by seven percentage points since year end this relatively high mix compared to the bank s other loan types is largely attributable to borrowing by local commercial businesses 
outstandings climbed over million or in compared to a growth rate for and in this year s growth resulted from persistent business development efforts and the contributions of new lenders who joined the bank coincident with or as part of s acquisitions 
last year s increase was further aided by the acquired loans 
more than of the bank s total number of commercial loans have balances less than  which as a group constitutes approximately of commercial loan outstandings 
commercial loans ranging from  to  comprise nearly of loans outstanding while loans in the size range of  amount to 
loans with balances greater than  but less than million represent of the portfolio  while loans of million or more account for of outstandings 
demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine  and mobile home dealers slowed in outstandings ended the year or million higher compared to growth of or million in tighter underwriting standards and increased competition from financing subsidiaries of major automakers for new car purchases can be pointed to as causes of the slowing level of growth 
this portfolio segment  of which relates to automobile lending of the vehicles are used versus are new  constitutes of total loans outstanding  down from in and its peak of in the segment of the company s loan portfolio committed to consumer mortgages includes both fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
it accounts for million or of total loans outstanding 
the growth during the last two years million or in attributable to the nationwide refinancing boom and million or in is lower than it would otherwise be due to a program which began in mid to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
the purpose of this program  with sales of million in  million in and million this year  is to develop a meaningful source of servicing income as well as to provide an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
the direct consumer lending activity decreased slightly this year 
s outstandings fell or million versus a increase or million in due to acquisitions 
this line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans including some isolated installment lending to small businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principle repayment begins  and borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit 
the consumer direct segment as a percent of total loans trended upward in and however  s portfolio share fell percentage points from the prior year  possibly representing consumer borrowing being refinanced as mortgage debt in overall mortgage refinancing activity 
the latter represents a strategy that cbna has been promoting in several of its major markets  with special emphasis on paying down credit card debt held by other lenders

the company s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status and recognize income on a cash basis when it is more than ninety days past due  except when in the opinion of management it is well secured and in the process of collection 
provision and reserve for loan losses nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million 
this level is approximately  or lower than one year earlier  reflecting a decrease in day delinquencies being partially offset by higher nonaccruals 
accordingly  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans has fallen bps during the year to 
as of september   when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at  the company s asset quality was in the favorable th percentile compared to peers 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which additionally include troubled debt restructuring and other real estate to total loans plus oreo is also considered favorable at  down basis points from one year earlier 
total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due and nonaccruing  trended slightly lower as a percent of total loans in  generally fluctuating within a range of to  as compared to a range of to in the first six months of saw total delinquencies drop sharply from at year end to at june   total delinquencies remained relatively stable for the last half of  finishing at 
as of year end  total delinquencies for commercial loans  installment loans  and real estate mortgages were   and  respectively 
these measures compare favorably to delinquencies of peer bank holding companies as of september  of   and  respectively 
the bank strives to maintain its total and component category delinquencies below a internal guideline 
as of september   when overall delinquencies were at  the company ranked in the favorable th peer percentile 
factors contributing to successful underwriting  collection  and credit monitoring include selective addition of experienced lenders over the last several years  loan servicing on a regional level  collection departments focused on taking prompt corrective action  and a centralized loan review function which is given priority attention and has monthly board of director accountability 
as an indication of the company s timely charge off policy  which enables delinquencies to be managed better than the norm  net charge offs finished the year at million or a relatively high 
of average loans 
as a result of unusually high installment loan charge offs in the first quarter of a trend carried over from the fourth quarter of  gross charge offs rose to million  or 
of average loans outstanding versus 
in this year s recoveries rose to an all time record in dollar amount of  while down from in percentage terms to of prior year gross charge offs 
as of september   the bank s total net charge off ratio was in the th peer percentile based on the peer norm of 
significant progress in lowering net charge offs to more satisfactory levels is evidenced by a fourth quarter ratio of 
compared to a 
one year earlier  which was the high point for a timely charge off policy and relatively low nonperforming loans have enabled the company to carry a reserve for loan losses generally below peers 
as a percent of total loans  the loss reserve ratio has decreased to a level at year end from as of year end 
though the reserve ratio is presently at the peer norm being in the th peer percentile  coverage of nonperforming loans as of september  was well above the norm in the th percentile  management believes the year end coverage at to be ample 
the company s small business loan orientation has historically reduced the likelihood of large  single borrower charge offs 
another measure of comfort to management is that after conservative allocation by specific customer and loan type  over of loan loss reserves remains available for absorbing general  unforeseen loan losses 
the annual loan loss provision has historically been in excess of net charge offs by approximately 
however  because of lower than expected charge offs on acquired key and fleet loans and a sufficient loss reserve pertaining to all other loans  every dollar of net charge offs was covered by a single dollar of provision in consequently  the bank felt comfortable keeping the loan loss reserve flat at the year end level of million 
management continually evaluates reserve adequacy from a variety of perspectives  including projected overall economic conditions for the coming year 
the reserve for loan losses also encompasses risk associated with potential year business losses of its customers 
as a percentage of average loans  the annual loan loss provision was well above the peer norm in the th percentile as of september  for full year  the loss provision ratio was  down from 
in  consistent with the company s decision to reduce net charge off coverage from times in to times this year 
consequently  loan loss provision expense rose  or in versus million or nearly in the prior year

there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital market borrowings 
sources of funds average th quarter balances million total funds year ipc deposits public funds capital borrowings sources amount total amount total amount total amount change the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time record for a fourth quarter average of billion  up slightly million or less than half of one percent from the comparable period 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  are uncollateralized  and have a relatively low cost  and because they represent a working customer base with the potential to be cross sold a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products 
the mix of cbsi s ipc deposits has changed over the last five years as measured by the trend of fourth quarter average balances 
the time deposit share grew steadily  from of deposits in to in  reflecting consumer movement away from immediately available  lower earning savings and money market accounts as well as the relatively high mix of time deposits in the branches that have been acquired over the last few years 
the time deposit mix was reduced to in  corresponding to a million reduction in outstandings 
conversely  transaction accounts increased by an unusually strong million no acquisitions having occurred during the period 
the resulting three percentage points higher deposit share of reflects continued commercial customer growth and  more importantly  a lower opportunity cost of noninvested funds 
deposits of local municipalities increased million or during the past year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter 
under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
utilization of municipal deposits has generally been decreasing since as a percent of total funding sources  the uptick in reflects the strong cash flow of municipal customers 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
also considered a borrowing is the million in company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities issued to support s acquisitions 
capital market borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter compared to million or of total funding sources for the same period in as of december   more than half or million of capital market borrowings excluding the aforementioned trust preferred securities had original terms of one year or more

this must be accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand is low and infusing funds when demand is high  b implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investment risk weights as determined by regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and e generating a favorable return without undo compromise of other requirements 
starting in the third quarter of  the company adopted the use of total return as its primary methodology for managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  the company seeks to maximize shareholder value through both interest income and market value appreciation 
throughout  falling interest rates accelerated the prepayments of many of the company s assets  including those in its residential mortgage  mortgage backed security and collateralized mortgage obligation cmo portfolio 
such refinancings prompted management to consider asset liability strategies that would help reduce further balance sheet exposure to a low interest rate environment 
four primary action steps were developed and implemented as a result 
early in the second quarter of  management s first strategic initiative was to sell million in libor based cmo floaters and million in callable bonds with months or less to first call date 
this action resulted in a gain to the company of  over book 
including gains  the total holding period return for these bonds averaged 
to hedge against further declines in the yield curve  all proceeds were reinvested in long lockout callable bonds and discounted cmos 
the second strategic decision made by management was to choose early adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
during the third quarter 
this action made it possible to reclassify nearly all of the company s million held to maturity investments as available for sale 
greater flexibility was thus achieved when managing the investment portfolio from a total return perspective 
as the fall in interest rates further accelerated in the latter half of the year  long term investment opportunities became quite limited  leading to the development of a third action plan 
rather than continue to leverage bank capital through the purchase of securities with increased future market value risk  management embarked upon a strategy to deleverage portions of its investment portfolio 
this decision ultimately provided the opportunity for the company to begin its stock buy back program announced in the third quarter of  which resulted in  shares or million in common stock being repurchased during the late summer and early fall 
approximately million in investment securities was sold as a result of this deleverage strategy 
gains recorded over book amounted to million  while the total holding period return on the assets sold averaged 
the majority of investments sold were high coupon callable bonds with one year or less remaining to first call date or mortgage related securities mortgage backed and cmo with an average life of under two years 
interest rate sensitivity to a potentially falling interest rate environment improved as a result of these sales 
the fourth and final strategic action for the year came in mid november following successive policy moves by the federal reserve bank beginning on september   which brought the targeted federal funds rate down from to 
with short term capital market borrowing costs experiencing similar declines  the company chose to reinvest its portfolio cashflows back into securities rather than repay short term obligations or continue buying back its common stock 
the most attractive opportunity from both a total return and interest rate risk perspective was a barbell purchase strategy coupling long term aaa rated and insured municipal bonds with uncapped sallie mae floaters 
as mentioned previously  the downward pressure on interest rates during led to historically high levels of mortgage refinancings in a variety of asset sectors 
most notable were the prepayments experienced in the company s premium cmo portfolio 
premium cmos  for purposes of this discussion  are defined as those securities with an original purchase price of or higher 
under general accounting standards  any premium paid for mortgage related bonds is required to be amortized to par using a constant yield methodology 
as mortgage prepayments increased throughout the year  the monthly premium amortization associated with these bonds increased accordingly 
because all such adjustments are treated as reductions to investment income  the effects from high prepayment levels serve to decrease the overall investment portfolio yield 
the average portfolio yield  including the effects from higher premium cmo amortization  was  or an earned spread to the average three year treasury rate of basis points bps 
this is down from levels  when the portfolio returned or a spread of bps to the same treasury benchmark 
higher premium amortization was largely responsible for this decline in spread  the impact of which was estimated at bps or a million accelerated charge against interest income 
however  when investment gains of million on million in sales are included  the portfolio earned a cash return of or a spread of bp s over the three year treasury benchmark  an improvement of bps from the prior year 
the composition of the portfolio continues to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs and us agency cmos  resulting in effective use of regulatory risk based capital 
as of year end  these three security types excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock accounted for a combined of total portfolio investments  and  respectively  down slightly from in the prior year 
high balances of aaa rated and insured municipal bond balances at year end accounted for this change 
as of year end  the portfolio held million of premium cmos purchased before december  versus million one year earlier 
the average life of the portfolio  including the exercise of embedded call options  decreased to years as of december  at year end  the average life was years 
as a result of the above strategies  total investments excluding money market investments ended at million  down million or from year end  the portfolio reached a high point in april of approximately million and a low point in november of approximately million

market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors  which reviews and approves them annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits  and overall market interest related level and trends 
interest rate risk at community bank system  inc  the fundamental purpose behind interest rate risk management is to maximize net interest income over both a short term tactical and longer term strategic time horizon 
because the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation 
the analysis begins by measuring the impact of differences in maturity and repricing of all balance sheet positions 
such work is further augmented by adjusting for prepayment and embedded option risk found naturally in certain asset and liability classes 
finally  balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the company 
changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance sheet to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities including an up or down basis point movement in rates from current levels 
while such an aggressive movement in rates provides management with good insight as to how the company s profit margins may perform under extreme market conditions  results from a more modest shift in interest rates are used as a basis to conduct day to day business decisions 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity analysis as of december  in addition to a basis point increase decrease in rates  this analysis assumes a static  no growth balance sheet rate change estimated basis points net interest income sensitivity bp bp the preceeding interest rate risk analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the relationship within days between liquid assets and short term liabilities which are vulnerable to nonreplacement  and second  a projection of subsequent cash flow funding needs over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons

any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
based on its assessment  the company determined that the majority of its processing systems are outsourced to industry standard vendors 
the company  through its year committee  has identified critical vendors and processes and have put in place monitoring and measuring techniques to assure its critical vendors are complying with the federal financial institutions examining council guidelines for year compliance 
in brief  the company s loan  deposit  and general ledger systems are outsourced to fiserv  inc  the investment accounting system is outsourced to first tennessee bank  atm processing is outsourced to mellon network services  inc  and the trust accounting system employs sungard software 
the company is subject to quarterly reviews by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  including year compliance 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated without impact on the company s operations 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the status of year compliance and if appropriate contingency plans and business resumption plans are in place in the event the vendor or customer should experience a year compliant failure 
to date  of our vendors have responded that they are year compliant  have reported that they are working diligently and will be compliant before january   and have not yet stated their position 
the company is closely following the progress of those vendors who are working on the project and will seek alternate vendors for all suppliers that cannot become year compliant or those vendors who have failed to respond to the company s inquiries 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test and validate the software for year modifications 
the company has estimated that the overall year dollar expense for upgrades and equipment will total between  and  this budget estimate includes but is not limited to expenditures for upgrades to item processing software and hardware  ncr atm s  third party reviews of outsourcing vendors  proxy testing  pc software and hardware  the cost of service vendor mailings  follow up testing  customer awareness efforts and commercial customer risk assessments 
the company plans to complete all renovations on critical systems before march  to date the company has incurred approximately  of expenses funded through general operations  related to the assessment of and renovation replacement efforts in connection with its year project plan 
no major information technology projects have been significantly delayed as a result of year compliance efforts 
the cost of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates and efforts  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modifications plans and other factors 
the company does not anticipate any material disruption of service  however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved 
new accounting pronouncements effective january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

this statement established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
the company has reported other comprehensive income within the statements of changes in shareholders equity 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
upon adoption of the sfas the company transferred investment securities from held to maturity to available for sale see note c 
as a result  securities previously classified as held to maturity were sold during the year and investment securities gains of approximately  net of tax  resulting from the sale have been reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principal 
the company has no outstanding derivative financial instruments and  accordingly  adoption of sfas had no other affect on the company s financial statements

 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement requires that after the securitization of a mortgage loan held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
sfas no 
is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  and accordingly  would apply to the company for the quarter ending march  the company has not engaged in the securitization of its mortgage loans held for sale and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future
