the company operated as a majority owned subsidiary of ahc from until december  when ahc distributed to its stockholders all of its holdings in amsurg common stock the distribution 
prior to the distribution  the company effected a recapitalization pursuant to which every three shares of the company s then outstanding common stock were converted into one share of class a common stock 
immediately following the recapitalization  ahc exchanged a portion of its shares of class a common stock for shares of class b common stock 
the principal purpose of the distribution was to enable the company to have access to debt and equity capital markets as an independent  publicly traded company 
upon the distribution  the company became a publicly traded company 
the following table presents the components of changes in the number of surgery centers in operation and centers under development for the years ended december   and a center is deemed to be under development when a partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of year new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers sold centers in operation  end of year centers under development  end of year thirty nine of the surgery centers in operation as of december  perform gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures  eleven centers perform ophthalmology procedures  one center performs orthopaedic procedures  and one center performs ophthalmology  urology  general surgery and otolaryngology procedures 
the other partner or member in each partnership or limited liability company is in each case an entity owned by physicians who perform procedures at the center 
the specialty physician networks are owned through limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which the company owns a majority interest 
the other partners or members are individual physicians who will provide the medical services to the patient population covered by the contracts the network will seek to enter into with managed care payers 
it is not expected that the specialty physician networks in themselves will be a significant source of income for the company 
these networks were and will be formed in selected markets primarily as a contracting vehicle for certain managed care arrangements to generate revenues for the company s practice based surgery centers 
as of december   three networks had secured managed care contracts and were operational 
during  the company had a majority interest in two specialty physician practices which were acquired in january and january  the other partners of which were entities owned by the principal physicians who provide professional medical services to patients of the practices 
in may  the company s board of directors approved a plan to dispose of the company s interests in these two physician practices as part of an overall strategy to exit the practice management business and focus solely on the development  acquisition and operation of ambulatory surgery centers and specialty networks 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  in the second quarter of for the estimated loss on the disposal of these assets  and on june  and october   the company completed the disposition of each of these practices see consolidated financial statements note c 
the company intends to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties 
in addition  the company believes that its surgery centers  combined with its relationships with specialty physician practices in the surgery centers markets  will provide the company with other opportunities for growth from specialty network development 
by using its surgery centers as a base to develop specialty physician networks that are designed to serve large numbers of covered lives  the company believes that it will strengthen its market position in contracting with managed care organizations 
while the company generally owns to of the entities that own the surgery centers  the company s consolidated statements of operations include of the results of operations of the entities  reduced by the minority partners share of the net earnings or loss of the surgery center practice entities 
sources of revenues the company s principal source of revenues is a facility fee charged for surgical procedures performed in its surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly to third party payers by such physicians 
historically  the company s other significant source of revenues has been the fees for physician services performed by the two physician group practices in which the company owned a majority interest 
however  as a result of the disposition of these practices  the company will no longer earn such revenue 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers and physician practices such as those in which the company owns or has owned a majority interest depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients 
the company derived approximately  and of its revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  from governmental healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid 
the medicare program currently pays ambulatory surgery centers and physicians in accordance with fee schedules which are prospectively determined 
the company s sources of revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows surgery centers physician practices other total results of operations the following table shows certain statement of operations items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and revenues operating expenses salaries and benefits other operating expenses depreciation and amortization net loss on sale of assets total operating expenses operating income minority interest other expenses interest expense  net of interest income distribution cost earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings accretion of preferred stock discount net earnings loss available to common shareholders year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over revenues in the increase is primarily attributable to additional centers in operation in and same center revenue growth of

the company anticipates further revenue growth during as a result of additional start up and acquired centers expected to be placed in operation and from same center revenue growth 
salaries and benefits expense was million in  an increase of million  or  over salaries and benefits expense in this increase resulted primarily from additional centers in operation and from an increase in corporate staff primarily to support growth in the number of centers in operation and anticipated future growth 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in due to the absence of physician salaries of the practice disposed of in june other operating expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over other operating expenses in this increase resulted primarily from additional centers in operation 
this increase was offset by a reduction in physician practice expenses of the practices disposed of in the company anticipates further increases in operating expenses in primarily due to additional start up centers and acquired centers expected to be placed in operation 
typically a start up center will incur start up losses while under development and during its initial months of operations and will experience lower revenues and operating margins than an established center until its case load grows to a more optimal operating level  which generally is expected to occur within months after a center opens 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in over  primarily due to additional surgery centers in operation in compared to net loss on sale of assets in primarily resulted from the company s decision to exit the physician practice management business 
in the second quarter of  the company reduced the carrying value of the long lived assets of the practices held for sale by approximately million based on the estimated sales proceeds less estimated costs to sell 
the ultimate disposition of the practices  which occurred later in  resulted in no significant change from the estimate originally recorded in the second quarter of the company s minority interest in earnings in increased by million  or  over primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
interest expense decreased  or  in over due to the repayment of long term debt from the proceeds of the public offering in june see liquidity and capital resources and a decrease in the company s borrowing rate due to a decrease in borrowing levels 
the reduction in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in debt assumed or incurred in connection with additional acquisitions of interests in surgery centers  together with the interest expense associated with newly opened start up surgery centers financed partially with bank debt 
distribution cost in represents costs incurred by the company related to effecting the distribution 
the company recognized income tax expense of million in  compared to million in the company s effective tax rate in both years was of earnings prior to the impact of net loss on sale of assets and distribution cost and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
accretion of preferred stock discount in resulted from the issuance during november of redeemable preferred stock with a redemption amount of million 
the preferred stock was recorded at its fair market value  net of issuance costs 
from the time of issuance  the series a redeemable preferred stock was accreted toward its redemption value  including potential dividends  over the redemption term 
during the first quarter of  the holders of this series of preferred stock elected to convert their preferred shares into  shares of class a common stock pursuant to the provisions of the company s charter using a conversion ratio based on the market price of the company s class a common stock 
accordingly  the company recorded no accretion in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over revenues in the increase is primarily attributable to additional centers in operation in and the acquisition of a urology physician practice on january  excluding the three centers which were disposed as described below  same center revenues in increased by

salaries and benefits expense was million in  an increase of million  or  over salaries and benefits expense in other operating expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over other operating expenses in this increase resulted primarily from additional centers in operation  the acquisition of the interest in the urology physician practice and from an increase in corporate staff primarily to support growth in the number of centers in operation and anticipated future growth 
salaries and benefits expense and other operating expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of revenues remained comparable at in and however  salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenues decreased in while other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased proportionately in compared to  primarily due to the addition of contracted physician service expense for the physician practice acquired in january within other operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in over  primarily due to additional surgery centers and one physician practice in operation in compared to included in net loss on sale of assets in is a loss of approximately million from the disposition of the company s investment in a partnership that owned two surgery centers acquired in various disagreements with the sole physician partner over the operation of these centers had adversely impacted the operations of these centers 
after a series of discussions and attempts to resolve these differences  the company determined that the partners could not resolve their disagreements and that as a result the carrying value of the assets associated with this partnership would not likely be fully recovered 
the company projected the undiscounted cash flows from these centers and determined these cash flows to be less than the carrying value of the long lived assets attributable to this partnership 
accordingly  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets over the present value of the estimated future cash flows was recorded in the first quarter of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in september  the company sold its interest in the partnership assets to its physician partner and recognized a partial loss recovery 
management believes it has good relationships with its other physician partners and that the loss attributable to the partnership discussed above resulted from a unique set of circumstances 
in addition  net loss on sale of assets includes a pretax gain of approximately  from the sale in july of a surgery center building and equipment which the company had leased to a gastrointestinal physician practice 
concurrent with the sale  the company terminated its management agreement with the physician practice for the surgery center in which the company had no ownership interest but had managed since the company s minority interest in earnings in increased by million  or  over primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
interest expense increased  or  in over due to debt assumed or incurred in connection with additional acquisitions of interests in surgery centers and a physician practice  together with the interest expense associated with newly opened start up surgery centers financed partially with bank debt 
distribution cost in represents costs incurred by the company related to effecting the distribution

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million compared to million in operating activities for generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 
during the company used approximately million to acquire interests in seven additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers 
in addition  the company made capital expenditures primarily for new start up surgery centers and for new or replacement property at existing centers which totaled million in  of which million was funded from the capital contributions of the company s minority partners 
the company used its cash flow from operations and net borrowings on long term debt of million to fund its acquisition and development obligations 
on june   the company completed a public offering of  shares of class a common stock  for net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds  along with cash flow from operations  were used to repay million in borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility the loan agreement and other long term debt during the company also received cash proceeds of  from the sale of a surgery center during at december   borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility were million  are due in january and are guaranteed by the wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  and in some instances  the underlying assets of certain developed centers 
the loan agreement permits the company to borrow up to million to finance the company s acquisition and development projects at a rate equal to  at the company s option  the prime rate or libor plus a spread of to  depending upon borrowing levels 
the loan agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments based on borrowing levels 
the loan agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends and contains covenants relating to the ratio of debt to net worth  operating performance and minimum net worth 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  on november   the company issued shares of its series a redeemable preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock to certain unaffiliated institutional investors for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
the purpose of the offering was to fund the acquisition and development of surgery centers and to provide other working capital as needed prior to being in position to access capital markets as an independent public company 
the series a preferred stock  which had a liquidation value of million and was subject to redemption at any time at the option of the company  upon the occurrence of certain events and in at the option of the holders  was converted during the first quarter of fiscal by its holders into  shares of class a common stock using a conversion ratio based on the market price of the class a common stock pursuant to the provisions of the company s charter 
upon the public offering completed on june   the series b preferred stock automatically converted into  shares of class a common stock as determined by a conversion ratio providing for the issuance of that number of shares which approximated of the equity of the company determined as of november  on june   hcfa published a proposed rule that would update the ratesetting methodology  payment rates  payment policies and the list of covered surgical procedures for ambulatory surgery centers 
the proposed rule is subject to a comment period that has been extended until june   and provides for an implementation date that has been extended to a date no earlier than january the proposed rule reduces the rates paid for certain ambulatory surgery center procedures reimbursed by medicare  including a number of endoscopy and ophthalmological procedures performed at the company s centers 
the company believes that the proposed rule if adopted in its current form would adversely affect the company s annual revenues by approximately at that time 
however  if the proposed rule were adopted in its current form  the company expects that the earnings impact will be offset by certain actions taken by the company or that the company intends to take  including actions to effect certain cost efficiencies in center operations  reduce corporate overhead costs and provide for contingent purchase price adjustments for future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement successfully these actions or that if implemented the actions will offset fully the adverse impact of the rule  as finally adopted  on the earnings of the company 
there also can be no assurance that hcfa will not modify the proposed rule  before it is enacted in final form  in a manner that would adversely impact the company s financial condition  results of operation and business prospects 
year the company has evaluated its risks associated with software and hardware components which may fail due to the millennium change and has determined these risks include but are not limited to i risk that surgical equipment critical to the patient s care may fail  ii risk that billing and administration software will not support timely billing and collection efforts and iii risk that third party payers will not be able to provide timely reimbursement for services performed 
in order to address these risks  the company has designed and implemented a year assessment and action plan 
because the company generally has no internally designed software systems or hardware components nor does the company market or support any software or hardware products  the company has focused its efforts on ensuring that its systems are year compliant by implementing a plan designed to evaluate all critical systems purchased from third parties at each of its operating surgery centers and its corporate offices 
the assessment plan involves i identifying all potential year hardware and software components  including but not limited to surgical equipment  office machinery  financial software and general service equipment and components  ii contracting with a third party consultant to measure surgical equipment products against their year compliance database  iii obtaining verification from third parties whether their products are year compliant and  if not  the third parties ability to make the appropriate modifications and iv testing systems in a controlled environment to determine their ability to function accurately beyond in addition  the company has begun to contact all significant suppliers and third party payers to determine if they are year compliant and if they will be able to continue to provide products  services or reimbursement in this assessment plan was initiated in the third quarter of and is expected to continue throughout nearly all of the company s surgery centers have completed their identification of medical hardware and software and have measured the items year compliance against the third party consultants database 
most non medical equipment has also been identified and testing and or communication with vendors is in process 
based on the ongoing findings of the assessment plan  the company has begun the remediation process to replace or modify those systems not found to be year compliant 
although a complete cost assessment will not be determinable until all operating locations have been fully assessed  the company currently estimates that the company and the surgery centers in the aggregate may incur total capitalizable and non capitalizable costs ranging from  to  in to ensure that all centers and the corporate offices are year compliant 
however  until the assessment and remediation processes are completed  the company is unable to estimate with certainty the total costs to make the company year compliant 
no significant costs have been incurred to date associated with year compliance 
all costs to evaluate and make modifications will be expensed as incurred  will generally be shared by the company s physician partners in proportion to their ownership interest and are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or ongoing results of operations 
the company has yet to establish a contingency plan  but intends to formulate one to address its significant risks by the second quarter of recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no

requires that start up costs be expensed as incurred and that upon adoption  all deferred start up costs be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company estimates approximately  net of minority interest and income taxes  will be expensed as of january  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
