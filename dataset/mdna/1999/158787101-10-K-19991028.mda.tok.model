item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon the historical consolidated financial statements of the company  which present the company s results from continuing operations  financial position and cash flow 
prior to july   the company historically operated as part of daka international 
the historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal include the assets  liabilities  income and expenses that were directly related to the restaurant business as operated within daka international prior to the spin off 
the company s financial statements for fiscal include all of the related costs of doing business  including charges for the use of facilities and for employee benefits  and includes an allocation of certain general corporate expenses  including costs for corporate logistics  information technologies  finance  legal and corporate executives 
these allocations of general corporate expenses were based on a number of factors including  for example  personnel  labor costs and sales volumes 
management believes these allocations as well as the assumptions underlying the preparation of the company s separate consolidated financial statements to be reasonable 
as a result of the spin off  certain other non restaurant operating assets and liabilities of daka international were contributed to the company as described in note to financial statements 
those assets and liabilities consisting of notes receivable  property  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and contingent liabilities have been recorded within their respective captions during fiscal and resulted in a decrease to stockholders equity of million 
forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
words such as believe  anticipate  estimate  project  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their respective dates 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  many of which may be beyond the company s control 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results of current and future operations may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
factors that may cause such a difference include  among others  the following the ability of the company to successfully implement strategies to improve overall profitability  the impact of increasing competition in the casual and upscale casual dining segments of the restaurant industry  changes in general economic conditions which impact consumer spending for restaurant occasions  adverse weather conditions  competition among restaurant companies for attractive sites and unforeseen events which increase the cost to develop and or delay the development and opening of new restaurants  increases in the costs of product  labor  and other resources necessary to operate the restaurants  unforeseen difficulties in integrating acquired businesses  the availability and terms of financing for the company and any changes to that financing  the revaluation of any of the company s assets and related expenses  the ultimate outcome of certain contingent obligations related to the company s former fuddruckers segment and its other predecessor businesses  the impact on the company and or its suppliers of matters related to the so called yk problem  the issuance and renewal of licenses and permits for restaurant development and operations  including the sale of alcoholic beverages  and the amount of  and any changes to  tax rates 
results of operations overview the company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to a comparable operating loss of million last year 
included in the loss for continuing operations for fiscal were charges associated with exit and other charges million  sale and write down of non essential assets million  changes in estimates for continuing obligations of predecessor businesses million  and losses on business and lease contracts million 
exclusive of these charges  the company would have reported a loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal while the company believes it has strategies that will give it an opportunity to return to overall profitability  there can be no assurance that such strategies will be implemented  or if implemented  will be successful 
accordingly  the company may continue to incur operating losses 
the amount of losses and the time required by the company to reach sustained profitability cannot be predicted with certainty and to achieve profitability the company must  among other things  successfully reduce selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from historical levels while continuing to increase net revenues from its restaurants and successfully executing its growth strategy for the champps americana concept 
in item  see consideration of strategic alternatives  changes in executive officers and directors and resolution of proxy contest and acquisition and disposition transactions for a discussion of events in fiscal that  in part  will shape the future direction of the company 
the company s champps americana concept is in the expansion phase 
the timing of revenues and expenses associated with opening new restaurants or closing or repositioning of existing restaurants are expected to result in fluctuations in the company s quarterly and annual results 
in addition  the company s results  and the results of the restaurant industry as a whole  may be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending priorities  national  regional or local economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy  traffic patterns  weather conditions  employee availability and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
changes in any of these factors could adversely affect the company 
to date  however  these factors have not had a significant negative impact since both sales and same store sales have increased overall 
among other factors  the success of the company s business and its operating results are dependent upon its ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and liquor costs and the mix between food and liquor revenues 
various factors beyond the company s control  such as adverse weather changes  may affect food costs and increases in federal  state and local taxes may affect liquor costs 
while in the past the company has been able to manage its exposure to the risk of increasing food and liquor costs through certain purchasing practices  menu changes and price adjustments  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future or that changes in its sales mix or its overall buying power will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
notwithstanding these risks  the company believes that its near term strategies  including  but not limited to  continued expansion of the champps americana concept  improving the execution of operating fundamentals  and streamlining the company s organizational structure and the effects of the spin off  the fuddruckers sale  the consolidation of corporate headquarters and the sale of non essential assets and businesses  and other related transactions  should provide it with an opportunity for improved overall profitability 
champps the following table sets forth certain financial information for champps 
in thousands restaurant sales    sales from champps restaurants operating expenses labor costs product costs other restaurant operating expenses depreciation and amortization restaurant unit contribution restaurant unit contribution    gain on sale of franchise franchising and royalty income restaurant unit  franchising and royalty contribution    comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  sales in company owned restaurants increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase reflects both an increase in the number of company owned restaurants open between years  and an increase in same store sales 
the company opened two new restaurants in fiscal same store sales increased approximately in fiscal restaurant unit contribution of million for fiscal was up from million in fiscal included in depreciation was million related to the accelerated depreciation of existing point of sale systems 
these systems will be replaced by new equipment in the first and second quarters of fiscal  to enable the implementation of more efficient software at both the operating level and for corporate financial reporting 
other restaurant operating expenses include controllable restaurant operating expenses  and also include occupancy and preopening expenses 
other restaurant operating expenses expressed as a percentage of sales were for fiscal compared with for fiscal this increase reflects both higher occupancy costs and controllable restaurant operating expenses between periods  offset  in part  by lower preopening expenses 
occupancy costs expressed as a percentage of sales have increased from to in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of restaurants opened over the last two years 
such restaurants were generally constructed under a sale leaseback facility where substantially all of the costs of construction were financed by the landlord 
this facility allowed the company to conserve cash but resulted in higher rents in these units when compared with restaurants built in earlier years 
preopening expenses were approximately million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this decrease relates primarily to the number of units opened  the timing of construction  and construction in progress between years 
preopening expenses have historically been approximately million per location 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  sales in champps owned restaurants increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal compared with million a year ago 
the increase primarily reflects three new champps owned restaurants in fiscal opened for the full current fiscal year  four new champps owned restaurants opened during  and higher per restaurant average sales volumes million annually for same stores 
same store sales increased approximately in restaurant unit contribution  for fiscal increased approximately million to million compared with million in the preceding year 
operating margins for were impacted by lower depreciation offset  in part  by higher occupancy costs 
other operating expenses in include preopening costs directly incurred totaling million  compared with million in fiscal specialty concepts on june   the company ceased the operations of its great bagel coffee business  which represented the sole remaining business of its former specialty concepts operation 
this decision resulted in a charge of million in fiscal for exit costs associated with the termination of leases  severance and write downs of fixed assets abandoned 
specialty concepts has historically included the operations of the great bagel coffee company and the operations of certain non traditional foodservice venues such as restaurant operations conducted by the company in home depot locations under the names leo s delicatessen and fudd cafes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to terminate its non traditional restaurant operations leaving only the great bagel coffee business operating 
the specialty concepts operation generated restaurant total revenues of million in and million in and unit losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses comparison of fiscal year ended june  and june  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million for fiscal  compared with approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses include losses of million of the sale of non essential assets  million in charges related to predecessor businesses and million of the total million in losses on business and lease contracts 
exclusive of these costs  general and administrative expenses for would have been million representing a increase over the prior year 
the company has recently undertaken an initiative to consolidate its existing corporate offices in massachusetts and minnesota into one office to be based in denver  colorado 
the company is targeting the completion of this initiative by late calendar or early in calendar  although there can be no assurance this initiative can be completed within this time frame 
the company believes that as a result of the changes discussed elsewhere in this form k  general and administrative expenses in fiscal should approximate of revenues 
comparison of continuing operations fiscal year ended june  and june  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal compared with in fiscal this improvement relates primarily to reduction in the work force and other reductions taken in coupled with the actual costs of maintaining the corporate overhead of the company when compared with the allocation of daka international s overhead estimated in fiscal as previously discussed 
income taxes prior to july   the operations of the company were generally included in the consolidated us federal income tax return and certain combined and separate state and local tax returns of daka international 
given the company s history of losses  no benefit for net operating losses were recognized in fiscal and the company s effective tax benefit rate was approximately for as of june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the carryforwards expire at various dates through discontinued operations on november   the company completed the sale of its fuddruckers business to king cannon for an estimated purchase price of million  subject to certain adjustments 
results of operations for the fuddruckers business have been presented in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations 
see acquisition and disposition transactions in item for a more complete discussion of this transaction 
accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company will adopt sfas no 
during fiscal year management is currently reviewing the effect  if any  from adoption of this statement to the company s consolidated financial statements 
year compliance the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the roll over of the two digit year value to 
this issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company has an information technology steering committee the committee which has been given the assignment of evaluating year compliance for all of the company s primary and mission critical software and hardware assets core systems and attempt to mitigate year compliance exposure 
based on the committee s review  the company has segregated its core systems into the following categories consolidated accounting and financial reporting  payroll  restaurant sales and accounting  data transmission  office support  and banking services 
except for banking services  the committee has completed its review of each of these categories and  as discussed further below  has identified several areas of non compliance including champps point of sale devices cash registers and payroll processing hardware and software as systems requiring upgrades and or replacement in order to be year compliant 
with respect to consolidated accounting and financial reporting core systems  the company utilizes nationally recognized systems such as oracle  windows  novell and xcellenet which are  or with readily available upgrades will be  year compliant and has received written assurances from a majority of these third parties to this effect 
the company estimates the costs to upgrade these systems are insignificant and its exposure to catastrophic year risk to be highly unlikely 
with respect to its payroll core system  the company s existing software and the related hardware are year deficient 
the company has selected a new software provider and the new payroll system is currently being installed 
the company completed initial installation tests of this year compliant payroll system in early october  however  due to other software changes  retesting of the company s payroll system implementation will be required 
all work is targeted to be completed by mid november  originally the company had estimated this system would be installed by july   however the implementation was delayed in part due to the changes in strategic direction discussed elsewhere in this form k 
the company presently estimates the cost to bring its payroll core systems year compliant to be approximately  the payroll core system is important to the company s day to day operations 
however  the company believes that it could manage its payroll processes manually in the event of a year system failure 
the company s champps point of sale and back office systems run on a windows platform 
the company is aware that although windows is substantially year compliant  there are certain non compliant features see financial condition and liquidity 
the operating software that resides on the windows platform are year compliant  however  the effect on such programs of any windows non compliance has not been determined 
as a result  the company is evaluating the impact  if any  of windows non compliance on its other pos and back office software 
the company s data transmission and office support core systems are year compliant in all significant respects 
an analysis of the company s banking services core systems has not been completed 
the company s primary banks are large  national banks  which the company believes mitigates exposure 
however  the company s review of its banking services will be completed by mid november  the company has not completed its evaluation of year compliance of its primary vendors for impact on the company 
the company has requested written confirmation from its third party vendors regarding their state of compliance with the year problem 
the company s main information technology provider  rcs  has a back up generator which will facilitate the continued operation of financial reporting systems 
in addition  one champps finance person will continue to reside in massachusetts near the rcs headquarters at the end of the calendar year 
along with other responsibilities  this person will support a contingency strategy for corporate financial reporting should long distance data communication be disrupted by year issues 
the company will continue to examine cost effective contingency strategies where warranted 
unless public suppliers of water  electricity  natural gas and banks are disrupted for a substantial period of time in which case the company s business may be materially adversely affected  the company believes its operations will not be significantly disrupted even if third parties with whom the company has relationships are not year compliant 
however  uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with any year compliance  and as a result it is impossible to predict the impact of the company s computers to fail to recognize the year the company intends to continue to make efforts to ensure that third parties with whom it has relationships are year compliant 
any year compliance problem of either the company or its vendors could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
financial condition and liquidity the working capital needs of companies engaged in the restaurant industry are generally low as sales are made for cash  and purchases of food and supplies  labor costs and other operating expenses are generally paid in to days after receipt of invoices 
capital expenditures for expansion during  and were generally provided through cash balances including in a portion of the proceeds from the sale of fuddruckers and proceeds from sale leaseback facilities 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for continuing operations  respectively  for fiscal  and at the end of fiscal  the company s unrestricted cash was million and restricted cash was million 
the company anticipates that it will generate positive cash flow from operations during fiscal  however  there are also significant cash expenditures anticipated during the forthcoming year 
anticipated in fiscal are capital expenditures of approximately million  primarily for new restaurants now under construction and a new point of sale system 
on september   the company received a commitment for sale leaseback financing for new restaurants 
this commitment is subject to various pre closing conditions and there can be no assurances that the financing will be available on the terms currently anticipated or at all 
the company is also pursuing a bank line of credit  although no commitment has been secured to date 
any additional restaurants opened in fiscal will be contingent upon obtaining additional financing 
it is also anticipated that there will be substantial cash payments in fiscal associated with liabilities recorded in fiscal related to the spin off  the fuddruckers sale and the consolidation and relocation of the headquarters to denver  colorado 
included in theses cash payments  the company anticipates expenditures of more than million for early termination of the lease on excess space  severance and other headquarters consolidation and relocation expenses 
in addition  there will be payments for prior year insurance claims  tax audits and legal settlements 
these latter expenditures are estimated to range between million to million 
there can be no assurance that a line of credit will be obtained or a sale leaseback facility implemented 
if the company is unable to obtain sources of financing  the company s planned expansion program and its ability to manage continuing obligations associated with predecessor businesses would be adversely effected 
in such a case  the company believes that it has the ability to curtail its champps expansion program and further reduce non essential operating costs to conserve working capital sufficiently to continue its day to day operations through fiscal inflation and changing prices has had no measurable impact on net sales and revenue or income from continuing operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures the market risk exposure inherent in the company s financial instruments and consolidated financial position represents the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to such interest rate risk primarily in its significant investment in cash and cash equivalents and the use of fixed and variable rate debt to fund its acquisitions of property and equipment in past years and the implicit investment rate in the company s sale leaseback arrangements 
market risk for cash and cash equivalents and fixed rate borrowings is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the assets or obligations resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in interest rates  which would not have been significant to the company s financial position or results of operations during the effect of a similar hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt and the investment rates implicit in the company s sale leaseback arrangements also would have been insignificant due to the immaterial amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit arrangements
