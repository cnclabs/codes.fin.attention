although the company has entered into various letters of intent  the company has not entered into any definitive acquisition agreements other than the pma merger agreement or administrative service agreements with respect to its physician practice management operations 
given the significant declines in the financial performance of many of the leading publicly traded physician practice management companies during the past year  the availability of financing for these ventures has been extremely limited 
this constriction in the financing market has had  and is likely to continue to have  an adverse impact on the company s ability to effect its physician practice management acquisitions

the dfs bridge loan is expected to be repaid from the long term financing to be obtained in connection with the proposed acquisition of jihp

the overall operating results of the company were affected during the years ended december   and due to the operational results of the philadelphia facility which incurred losses of   and  respectively 
in order to become profitable  this facility must attain a certain volume of business and it is uncertain whether such business level will ever be attained

in the event that this transaction is not consummated on or prior to may   management believes that the revolving line of credit can be refinanced on a longer term basis or the repayment due date extended 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are collateralized through a grant of a first security interest in all eligible accounts receivable 
the agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of working capital

see item certain relationships and related transactions 
the company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect  if any  on its financial condition or results of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries 
the nature of the company s operations require significant capital expenditures which generally have been financed through the issuance of debt and capital leases and proceeds received from the sale of equity securities  including the company s initial public offering of common stock and redeemable warrants in november  the subsequent exercise of such redeemable warrants and the sale of series c convertible preferred stock in february continued expansion of the company s business  including the establishment of physician practice management operations  will require substantial cash resources and will have an impact on the company s liquidity 
the company believes that cash to be provided by the company s operating activities together with borrowings available from the company s revolving line of credit will enable the company to meet its anticipated cash requirements for its present operations for the next twelve months 
continued expansion of the company s business  including the establishment of physician practice management operations  will require additional sources of financing 
both the dfs bridge loan and the revolving line of credit have maturity dates of may  these loans are expected to be repaid from the longer term financing to be obtained in connection with the proposed acquisition of jihp 
in the event that this acquisition is not consummated on or prior to may   management believes that the dfs bridge loan and revolving line of credit can be refinanced on a longer term basis and in the case of the revolving line of credit  such repayment due date could be further extended 
effect of year issue the year issue is a result of computer programs written using two digits instead of four digits to refer to a particular year 
therefore  these computer programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activity 
the company is currently assessing the impact of the year issue on its computer systems and technology  including i information technology such as software and hardware relating to its medical billing systems  accounting finance systems  payroll systems  desktop applications and servers  and ii non information systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various medical equipment  safety systems  facilities and utilities including telephones  facsimile machines  time clocks and postage meters 
the company is evaluating its state of readiness through surveys of its sites as well as through discussions with its significant vendors to determine the readiness of those vendors whose failure to correct year issues would materially impact the company 
the company has completed its site assessments and hopes to complete its assessment of the state of readiness of its significant vendors by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the cost to the company to correct its internal year issues is estimated to be  consisting of  related to the upgrading of its corporate server   relating to the upgrading of personal computers and  related to the upgrading of medical equipment 
the company has not yet incurred any costs related to the year compliance issue other than costs of  and time associated with  the site assessments and interfacing with vendors  which costs are not significant and are not separately identifiable but expects to expense as incurred all such costs 
the company anticipates that these costs will be funded through operating cash flows except as hereinafter described 
the company expects to complete these upgrades by the end of the third quarter of fiscal in connection with the company s strategic expansion into providing physician practice management services  the company has identified a state of the art information system that is represented by the service provider to be year compliant which the company intends to purchase and utilize in a wide area network setting upon consummation of its acquisition of jihp 
the costs related to such purchase and the integration of such new system are expected to be funded with the proceeds of the financing to be obtained in connection with the acquisition of jihp 
while the company believes its efforts are adequate to attain internal year compliance  the year readiness of its vendors may lag behind the company s efforts and it has not yet determined the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of its vendors to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of these third parties will be timely converted or that a failure to convert will not have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is not yet in a position to assess any such third party s compliance efforts or the impact on the company if any such efforts fail 
the company s current estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to modify and test its computer systems and technology and determine its state of readiness are based on management s best estimates including assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  year modification plans and other factors 
new developments may occur that could affect the company s estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to modify and test its systems for year compliance  including  but not limited to i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and equipment and iii the year compliance attained by its significant vendors 
the company has not developed  nor does it plan to develop  any contingency plans for any unplanned noncompliance issues from internal or external sources 
there can be no guarantee any unplanned noncompliance issues from internal or external sources will not have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
