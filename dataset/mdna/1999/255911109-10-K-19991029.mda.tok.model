an increase in large dollar software licenses in the insurance market were primarily responsible for the increase in license revenues 
maintenance revenues increased due to an expanding customer base 
for the year ended july   professional services revenues increased due to increased consulting and implementation services revenues in the insurance and utilities markets and increased document outsourcing revenues in the utilities market  partially offset by the approximate million decline in document outsourcing revenues resulting from the termination of the policy management systems corporation pmsc print outsourcing agreement 
backlog for the company s products and services of approximately million as of july   of which approximately million is scheduled to be satisfied within one year  is primarily composed of recurring software license and maintenance revenues for ongoing maintenance and support  software implementation and consulting services  and print outsourcing services 
software agreements for recurring license fees generally have non cancelable terms of up to five years 
annual maintenance contracts may generally be terminated upon days notice  however  the company has not historically experienced material cancellations of such contracts 
software implementation and consulting services backlog is principally performed under time and material agreements  of which some have cancellation provisions 
print outsourcing services agreements generally provide that fees are charged on a per transaction basis 
the estimated future revenues with respect to software implementation and print outsourcing services are based on management s estimate of revenues over the remaining life of the respective contracts 
formmaker  which was acquired by the company in connection with the merger  historically distributed its line of document automation platform dap software products to the insurance industry in north america through an exclusive marketing agreement with pmsc 
revenues from pmsc under this agreement for the year ended july  were approximately million 
in september  both parties agreed to terminate the marketing agreement and enter into a new non exclusive marketing agreement 
the new marketing agreement between the company and pmsc allows pmsc to market all of the company s software products to insurance and financial services companies worldwide 
for the year ended july   the company generated revenues of approximately million through the pmsc relationship 
print outsourcing revenues declined from fiscal year levels due to the may termination of the pmsc print outsourcing agreement 
the company received no print outsourcing revenues from pmsc in fiscal year  however  revenues from pmsc under the print outsourcing agreement for the year ended july  were approximately million 
professional services expense professional services expense is composed primarily of personnel expenses related to both consulting and document outsourcing services 
professional services expense increased due to increased personnel costs as the professional services department expanded  offset by a decrease in postage and supplies expense related to the decrease in print outsourcing revenues for the year 
the company s international services expansion has also increased professional services expense for the current fiscal year 
for the fiscal years ended july  and  professional services expense represented and of professional services revenues  respectively 
the company expects professional services expense to continue to increase in order to meet additional resource requirements as professional services activities increase domestically and internationally

in addition  the company concentrated on increasing market awareness through advertising  trade shows  and market research which increased these expenditures 
general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense decreased 
this is primarily the result of a decrease in legal fees from fiscal  which included legal defense and settlement costs related to the resolution of two litigation matters 
the decrease in legal fees was partially offset by an increase in goodwill amortization resulting from the ezpower and maitland acquisitions in march  and an increase in staffing levels within the general and administrative departments 
other income expense  net the significant increase in other income expense  net was due to a material amount of interest income generated during the fiscal year ended july  as compared with interest expense incurred during the prior year 
as a result of the receipt of approximately million of initial public offering ipo proceeds in april  interest income increased as compared to fiscal due to higher cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances maintained by the company

professional services revenues increased significantly  and license revenues increased due to inclusion of formmaker s results in the fiscal year ended july  maintenance and other recurring revenues increased as a result of inclusion of formmaker s maintenance revenues and an increased customer base 
revenues from pmsc under the exclusive marketing agreement for the year ended july  and on a pro forma basis were approximately million and million  respectively 
in september  both parties agreed to terminate the marketing agreement and enter into a new non exclusive marketing agreement 
the new marketing agreement between docucorp and pmsc allows pmsc to market all of the company s software products to insurance and financial services companies worldwide 
in may  the pmsc print outsourcing agreement was terminated 
revenues from pmsc under this agreement for the year ended july  and on a pro forma basis were approximately million and million  respectively 
professional services expense professional services expense is composed primarily of personnel expenses related to both consulting and print outsourcing services 
the majority of the million increase is due to the inclusion of formmaker personnel and related expenses during the entire fiscal year ended july  postage and supplies expense of approximately million for print outsourcing services  compared with million in the prior year  also contributed to the increase 
for the fiscal years ended july  and  professional services expense represented and of professional services revenues  respectively 
the increase in cost as a percentage of professional services revenues is mainly due to higher profit margins earned under a short term print outsourcing agreement in fiscal product development and support expense product development and support expense consists primarily of research and development efforts  amortization of capitalized software development costs  customer support  and other product support costs 
for the fiscal year ended july   product development and support expense increased compared to the corresponding prior year period  largely due to development efforts related to the company s dap product line  which was acquired in the merger 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense increased primarily as the result of inclusion of operations acquired in the merger and increased commissions

net income net income increased by approximately million for the fiscal year ended july  as compared to pro forma net income for the prior year period due primarily to an increase in revenues  partially offset by a increase in operating expenses 
year the year computer issue is primarily the result of information technology it or non it systems and programs with date sensitive devices  such as embedded chips or code using a two digit date format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such systems and programs may be unable to correctly interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other errors  with the resultant disruption in the operation of such systems 
the company has assembled an internally staffed team to address and manage the year project related to the company s products and services offerings  as well as any it and non it internal systems supporting the company s operations 
status of year readiness the company s analysis of the year project consists of the following five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
the awareness phase consists of defining the scope of the year problem and establishing a corporate infrastructure and overall strategy to perform compliance work 
the assessment phase must identify all hardware  software  networks  other various processing platforms  and customer and vendor interdependencies affected by the year problem 
this assessment must go beyond information systems and include environmental systems that are dependent on embedded microchips  such as security systems  elevators  and vaults 
the renovation phase includes code enhancements  hardware and software upgrades  system replacements  vendor certification  and other associated changes 
the validation process includes testing incremental changes to hardware and software components 
finally  in the implementation phase  systems should be certified as year compliant and be accepted by the business users 
for those systems  which are not compliant  the consequences will be assessed and any contingency plans put into effect 
internal infrastructure with respect to the company s internal it and non it software systems and hardware  the company has identified substantially all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with its internal operations that must be modified  upgraded  or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company has generally completed the process of modifying  upgrading  and replacing major it and non it software systems and hardware which have been identified as potentially being adversely affected 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  related to year compliance for its internal it and non it computer systems 
additionally  the company expects to incur an additional  related to year compliance for its internal it and non it computer systems 
product line and services offerings with respect to the company s product line and services offerings  current versions of the company s products are designed to be year compliant 
the company has identified all previous versions of its products which were not year compliant and has completed the process of testing and upgrading its product offerings 
customers using pre year compliant versions of the company s software products are entitled to receive upgraded year compliant software as part of their software support agreements with the company  as long as the customer support agreement remains in force 
the company has completed the process of assessing the extent to which its services implementations are year compliant 
to the extent the company is directly involved in resolving any non compliant services implementations  generally the customer will be responsible for the fees associated with such services 
accordingly  the company does not currently believe that the effects of any year non compliance in the company s installed base of products or services offerings will result in a material adverse impact on the company s business or financial condition 
however  the company is unable to predict the impact  if any  on the company s revenues as a result of its customers being distracted from their document automation needs as their attention is re directed  or customer resources are diverted  to becoming year compliant 
additionally  the company is unable to predict the impact  if any  on the company s revenues as a result of customers and prospects not purchasing additional software and services for the remainder of this calendar year due to customers not wanting to introduce any new products into their computing environments 
vendors the company has mailed questionnaires to substantially all third party vendors and suppliers of the major computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the year problem 
responses to these questionnaires are verified against information included with current releases of vendors products and services and on vendor web sites 
although the company is undertaking efforts to ensure that all its systems and programs are year compliant  the company has no control over services  functions  and data provided by third party vendors and others which may result in the inability to provide services 
the extent to which third party customers and vendors do not become year compliant on a timely basis or may be indirectly impacted by the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company 
systems other than it systems in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  elevators  air conditioning  fire systems  and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company has completed the remediation of these systems and believes that all major leased facilities are year compliant 
contingency plans the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented if its efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting its internal systems are not effective 
for mission critical projects  the company expects to complete its contingency plans by early november depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of backup sites  equipment  and software  increased work hours for our personnel  and use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for it systems 
disclaimer the discussion of the company s efforts relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
the ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely affected by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  third party suppliers ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
acquired in process research and development and related costs based on the results of an independent third party appraisal  the company recorded charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to expense in process research and development in process r d costs related to the acquisition of formmaker 
the aggregate purchase price related to the merger  including direct acquisition costs  was approximately million which was allocated to the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired  including in process r d 
acquired in process r d represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by formmaker in process r d 
the allocation of million to in process r d represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the in process r d projects 
in the opinion of management and independent third party appraisers  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and therefore  the in process r d had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were charged to operations on the closing date of the merger 
the value assigned to purchased in process r d was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process r d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process r d was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by formmaker and its competitors 
the estimated revenues for the in process r d assumed a compound annual growth rate of approximately in the four years following introduction  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d programs 
for each of the acquired in process r d efforts  the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three to four years of acquisition and then decline as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability associated with formmaker s in process r d  a discount rate of was used to value in process r d  and a discount rate of was used for the existing products and technology 
this discount rate was commensurate with the acquired in process r d projects stages of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
as of the date of the merger  formmaker had spent approximately million on in process r d projects 
subsequent to the date of the merger  the company expended approximately million for the completion of the in process r d projects which approximated the expected costs to complete such projects 
milestones for the in process r d projects were also examined as of the date of the merger 
for each in process r d project  company engineers evaluated the critical milestones 
this included comprehensive analysis of each of the acquired product lines in process r d to clarify the technological hurdles that the development team had overcome at the date of the merger as well as the hurdles that the engineers faced going forward to complete the remaining development efforts 
from this analysis  the overall significance of tasks completed versus tasks remaining were assessed 
for all categories  a greater level of significance was associated with completed tasks 
this implied that a greater degree of overall value was attributable to the completed tasks relative to those indicated by the cost metrics 
based on estimates made by formmaker s r d professionals regarding technical achievements completed as of the date of the merger  the milestone percentage was determined to be approximately 
utilizing this milestone analysis for the in process r d valuation resulted in values for incomplete r d projects which approximated the million appraisal value 
at the time of the merger  formmaker offered a basic portfolio of document automation processing and imaging software products 
formmaker s product lines and related services stemmed from its dap and multi user archival retrieval system mars technologies 
the acquired in process r d value was comprised of several ongoing projects intended to address the issues of technological advances in the marketplace such as new client server architecture  new delivery mechanisms  the internet  emergence of the windows nt operating system  object integration on the desktop  and new standards such as microsoft s active x  microsoft s odbc  and sun microsystems java  which were making the development and implementation of new products increasingly complex 
these advances in technology required creating highly advanced products that could handle substantial increases in demand  as well as end user requirements for more complex graphics intensive material 
this led to development efforts which centered around new dap and mars technologies and incorporated innovative new features and a wide array of advanced functions 
formmaker was addressing industry and technological trends by developing new delivery mechanisms via the internet  object integration on the desktop  new dap architecture  platform independence  improved workflow functionality  product compatibility  dap and mars integration  and the development of migration and upgrade paths 
at the merger date  there were still significant efforts needed to bring the acquired in process technologies and projects to fruition 
these efforts principally related to the completion of planning  designing  architecturing  coding  prototyping  scalability  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies would meet their design specifications 
these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility at the time of the merger 
management expected to continue to support these efforts and believed formmaker had a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there was risk associated with the completion of the projects and there was no assurance that any would reach either technological or commercial success 
if these projects were not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the combined company could have been adversely affected in future periods 
subsequent to the merger  the majority of the original r d projects were completed in accordance with formmaker s plans 
the fruition of these projects resulted in advanced new product technologies represented by the launch of the internet document server ids versions and  bill print version and  and which fueled the release of two new dap products 
the emergence of the ids products represented the completion of a key revolutionary technology 
this new rules based transaction processing server  released in october  allows for the dynamic generation of documents in industry standard adobe pdf format for web delivery and the ability to archive documents in a pure thin client fashion 
the second phase of ongoing projects aimed at addressing new internet functionalities pushed forward the release of ids version in december  which further addressed new delivery mechanisms and standards such as microsoft s active x  microsoft s odbc  and sun microsystem s java and represents the completion of the in process r d acquired in the merger 
the company began recognizing revenue related to ids products during fiscal year formmaker s pre acquisition efforts in developing new printing technologies have resulted in the release of bill print versions and in october and march  respectively  which address the high volume complex bill and statement printing needs of the utilities industry 
formmaker s investments in developing innovative features  new workflow capabilities  object oriented desktop integration  multiple language system communications  improved graphics capabilities and platform and hardware adaptability proved fruitful in yielding new dap releases in september that could adequately address international markets and open new industries  such as utilities and financial services 
the release of bill print versions and and the new dap releases have contributed to a significant increase in revenues derived from the utilities market 
revenues in this market increased in excess of in the fiscal year ended july   as compared to the previous fiscal year  and greater than for the fiscal year ended july   as compared to the corresponding prior year period 
in addition  these releases of in process r d have resulted in recent licenses to the financial services industry 
most of the in process r d projects acquired in the merger have been completed on schedule  but minor delays have occurred due to changes in technological and market requirements for document automation processing and imaging systems 
although all in process r d projects have been completed  no assurance can be made that the company s recent releases will be met with market acceptance 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has responded to inquiries by the securities and exchange commission sec regarding the value ascribed to the technology acquired as in process r d in connection with the merger 
to date  the company has not received further inquiries from the sec 
however  depending upon the outcome of any future discussions with the sec  the company s historical reported results could potentially be subject to restatement to reflect a reduction of the in process r d charge 
a reduction of the in process r d charge would result in a corresponding increase in the amount of goodwill  which is being amortized over a ten year period 
liquidity and capital resources at july   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
the company completed an ipo in the form of a rights offering to safeguard scientifics  inc stockholders in april net proceeds to the company from this offering  after deduction of the underwriting discount and ipo expenses  were approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents for the year ended july  decreased approximately million primarily as a result of investing approximately million in short term investments and repurchasing approximately million of the company s stock on the open market 
the decrease was substantially offset by cash generated from operations 
cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million was primarily related to the purchase of short term investments  development of capitalized software  and purchase of fixed assets 
as of july   the company had approximately  shares of treasury stock outstanding at an average per share cost of 
working capital was approximately million at july   compared with approximately million at july  in connection with the merger  the company assumed a million revolving credit facility from formmaker 
this credit facility was renegotiated in september in september  the company allowed million of the credit facility to expire under its normal terms 
the remaining million bears interest at the bank s prime rate less  or as of july   and was renewed and extended to march under the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of july  there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
the company s liquidity needs are expected to arise primarily from funding the continued development  enhancement  and support of its software offerings  selling and marketing costs associated principally with continued entry into new vertical and international markets  and repurchase of treasury stock under the company s stock repurchase program 
although the company has no current commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses or technologies  a portion of the company s cash could be used to acquire complementary businesses or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
the company currently anticipates that existing cash  short term investment balances  its existing credit facility  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its operating cash needs for the foreseeable future
