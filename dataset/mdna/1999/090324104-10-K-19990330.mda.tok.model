the increase in sales over and the increase in over were generated primarily through internal growth 
in  brokerage type sales brokerage sales experienced a decrease from this was the result of the loss of the rite aid business

direct store delivery sales increased by in and increased to of the total sales in these sales were only of total sales in the increase in direct store delivery sales as a percent of total sales was caused by the combination of the company s loss of the rite aid brokerage sales business and its ability to expand its presence in the direct store delivery portion of the business through increased sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
in both periods  the increase related to pricing was approximately equal to the increase in the consumer price index 
net sales for priority for  and were million  million and million  respectively

gross margins for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in gross margins from to and from to resulted primarily from internal growth 
the acquisition of twd accounted for approximately of the increase from to and had substantially less impact from to the impact in is difficult to quantify as the baltimore  maryland and tampa  florida warehouses of twd were closed in and their customers subsequently serviced out of existing facilities 
gross margins as a percent of net sales increased to in from in this increase was the result of the change in mix away from the lower margin brokerage sales to the higher margin from stock sales 
this change in mix resulted from both the loss of the rite aid brokerage sales business and the increased direct store delivery sales 
gross margins as a percent of net sales declined from in to in this decrease was the result of the substantial increase in low margin brokerage sales and a shift in the business mix of from stock sales to more managed care business

gross margins for priority for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the gross margin as a percent of sales for  and was  and  respectively 
the increase in margins over margins is primarily attributed to the change in sales mix resulting from significantly higher sales by priority pharmacy which generated higher gross margins than those of priority distribution

the cost increases related to the direct store delivery and alternate care alternate site businesses include  among others  delivery expense  warehouse expense  and labor costs  which are variable with the level of sales volume 
however  management remains focused on controlling sga through improved technology  better asset management and opportunities to consolidate distribution centers 
this focus has resulted in a decrease in sga expense as a percent of from stock sales to in from in and in non recurring charges related to the startup  consolidation and closing of certain divisions were  in   in and  in sga for priority was million in  million in and million in as a percent of sales  sga for was as compared to in this increase was the result of expenses associated with the opening of the grove city  ohio facility  which opened in november   training and payroll costs from hiring additional sales personnel at priority pharmacy and increased overall costs of being a publicly traded company 
the increase in sga from was attributed to the above mentioned normal costs to support this business 
sga as a percent of sales actually decreased from in to in depreciation and amortization was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these increases were the result of the inclusion of acquired entities and the depreciation and amortization on new facilities and equipment  particularly in management information systems and systems to support customer needs

in  the amount of net earnings associated with the minority interest was million as compared to  in the company s operations consumed million in cash for the year ended december  the use of funds resulted from increases in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
the increase in inventory resulted from the significant increase in direct store delivery sales and the new bulk inventory acquisition and purchasing management programs with certain customers 
the reduction of accounts payable is attributed to the timing of payments of invoices and the reduction of brokerage type sales to rite aid 
these uses of cash were offset by the decrease in accounts receivables resulting from the reduction of brokerage type sales to rite aid 
the company continues to closely monitor working capital in relation to economic and competitive conditions 
however  the emphasis on direct store delivery business will continue to require both net working capital and cash

the proceeds of this note  which bears interest at per annum and matures on december   were used by the ceo to exercise stock options

in december  the company established a receivables securitization facility the receivables facility pursuant to which the company sells substantially all of its receivables arising in connection with the sale of goods or the rendering of services receivables to bindley western funding corporation funding corp  a wholly owned special purpose corporation subsidiary 
the receivables are sold to funding corp 
on a continuous basis  and the cash generated by sales of interests in the receivables or by collections on the receivables retained is used by funding corp 
to  among other things  purchase additional receivables originated by the company 
the assets of funding corp 
will be available first and foremost to satisfy claims of funding corp 
creditors 
in connection with the receivables facility  funding corp 
entered into a receivables purchase agreement  dated as of december   with falcon asset securitization corporation falcon  an affiliate of the first national bank of chicago first chicago  certain other financial institutions collectively with falcon  the purchasers  and first chicago  as agent 
pursuant to the receivables purchase agreement  funding corp 
may  from time to time  sell interests in the receivables receivables interests to the agent for the benefit of the purchasers 
each receivables interest has an associated discount rate and tranche period applicable to it  as selected by funding corp 
the discount rate may  at funding corp 
s election  be the base rate the corporate prime or base rate announced from time to time by first chicago or  with respect to the receivables interests purchased by falcon  the cp rate generally  a commercial paper related rate based on falcon s funding charges or  with respect to the receivables interests purchased by other purchasers  the libo rate generally  libor for the applicable tranche period  plus per annum 
the receivables facility terminates on december   and is subject to final termination on december   subject to earlier termination in certain events 
at december   there were million of receivables interests outstanding  bearing a discount rate of per annum 
the company accounts for the receivables facility as a financing transaction in its consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the implementation of the receivables facility  on december   the company renegotiated its bank line of credit and now has million of available credit 
for  the net decrease in borrowings under the bank credit agreement was million 
at december   the company had borrowed million under the bank credit agreement and had a remaining availability of million 
at december   the company owed to priority million 
this amount is due on demand and represents loans of excess cash balances of priority to the company on a short term basis  bearing interest at the company s average incremental borrowing rate 
at december   the incremental borrowing rate was 
the company believes that its cash on hand  bank line of credit  receivables facility and working capital management efforts are sufficient to meet future working capital requirements 
the company s primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect the company s operating results and the cash flow available to fund operations and expansion 
based on the average variable borrowings for  an increase of in the average variable borrowing rate of the company would result in a million annual increase in interest expense 
conversely  a decrease in the average variable borrowing rate would result in a million annual decrease in interest expense 
the company continually monitors this risk and reviews the potential benefits of entering into hedging transactions  such as interest rate swaps  to mitigate the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the company was not a party to any hedging transactions 
the company s principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
the company sells inventory to its chain drug warehouse and other customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of its chain warehouse or other major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although the company monitors closely the creditworthiness of its major customers and  when feasible  obtains security interests in the inventory sold  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur some collection loss on chain drug or other major customer accounts receivable in the future 
year the year will pose a unique set of challenges to those industries reliant on information technology 
as a result of the methods employed by early programmers  many software applications and operational programs may be unable to distinguish the year from the year if not effectively addressed  this problem could result in the production of inaccurate data  or in the worst cases  the inability of the systems to continue to function altogether 
the company and other companies in the same business are vulnerable to the dependence on distribution and communications systems 
the company s daily sales system  which controls ordering  pricing  inventory control  and shipping for the company and which accounts for of the company s total investment in software  was initially designed and programmed to comply with the year challenge 
the company anticipates that its remaining systems will be fully year compliant by the end of the second quarter of furthermore  all software purchases within the past three years have been guaranteed to be compliant by the vendor 
the company has upgraded and replaced its hardware and network systems for reasons other than year compliance  however  and such new hardware and network systems will be fully tested during to ensure that they are also year compliant 
management estimates that the total cumulative costs relating to its efforts to make its systems compliant for the year will be approximately million  of which approximately  had been incurred as of december  management believes that the expenditures required to bring the company s systems into compliance will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s performance 
however  the year problem is pervasive and complex and can potentially affect any computer process 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the year compliance can be achieved without additional unanticipated expenditures and uncertainties that might affect future financial results 
moreover  to operate its business  the company relies on governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunications companies  shipping companies  suppliers and other third party service providers over which it can assert little control 
the company s ability to conduct its business is dependent upon the ability of these third parties to avoid year related disruptions 
the company is in the process of contacting its third party service providers about their year readiness  but the company has not yet received any assurances from any such third parties about their year compliance 
if the company s key third party service providers do not adequately address their year issues  the company s business may be materially affected  which could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has not to date developed any contingency plans  as such plans will depend on the responses from its third party service providers  in the event the company or any key third party providers should fail to become year compliant 
if required  critical functions could be handled on a manual basis until such time that the year malfunction was identified and resolved 
inflation 
the company s financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of its ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  the company believes that its gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products it distributes 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as they are received by the company and therefore reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity 
forward looking statements 
certain statements included in this annual report which are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  changes in interest rates  competitive pressures  changes in customer mix  financial stability of major customers  investment procurement opportunities  asserted and unasserted claims  changes in government regulations or the interpretation thereof and the ability of the company and the entities with which it transacts business to modify or redesign their computer systems to work properly in the year  which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statements
