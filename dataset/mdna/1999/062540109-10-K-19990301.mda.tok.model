long term debt on december  totaled million  down from million on december  this decline primarily results from a million reduction in borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb and a million reduction in private placement notes 
fhlb borrowings were million at december   compared to million at december  private placement notes totaled million and million at year end and  respectively 
the year over year change in fhlb borrowings and private placement notes reflect maturities 
also included in long term debt at year end were million in subordinated notes that mature in and million in capital securities that mature in international operations pacific century maintains an extensive international presence in the asia pacific region that provides opportunities to take part in lending  correspondent banking and deposit taking activities in these markets 
these activities are facilitated through bank of hawaii branches  a representative office with extensions and full service subsidiary affiliate banks 
this network of locations across asia pacific enables our customers to facilitate trade and investment between the us mainland  asia  and the pacific islands 
pacific century divides its international business into two areas the international market  which is asia related and the pacific market  which comprises the south and west pacific divisions 
through the international banking group of bank of hawaii and pacific century bank  na  pacific century offers international banking services to its corporate and financial institution customers in most of the major asian financial centers with support from its new york and honolulu operations 
bank of hawaii s offices that offer these services are located in hong kong  the philippines manila  cebu  and davao  south korea  singapore  japan  taiwan  and new york 
the international banking group of bank of hawaii continues to focus on correspondent banking and trade related financing activities and lending to customers with which it has a direct relationship 
the south pacific region consists of investments in subsidiary banks in french polynesia  new caledonia  papua new guinea  vanuatu  and bank of hawaii branch operations in fiji and american samoa 
since american samoa is us dollar based  its operation is included as domestic 
additionally  bank of hawaii has interests in affiliate banks located in samoa  solomon islands and tonga 
the banks in the french territories are currently operating under a management contract with credit lyonnais due to expire in the managers of those areas have a direct reporting line to the south pacific manager at bank of hawaii who is responsible for all operations in the french territories 
the operations of subsidiaries and affiliates are evaluated on a similar basis as branch offices 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is in large measure limited to the unhedged positions of pacific century s capital investment in these subsidiaries 
the largest south pacific subsidiary operations are in the french territories of french polynesia and new caledonia 
the west pacific division includes bank of hawaii branches in guam and in other locations in the region 
since the us dollar is used in these locations  the company s operations in the west pacific are not considered foreign for financial reporting purposes 
table provides a summary of assets  liabilities  operating revenue  and net income for pacific century s international operations for the last three years 
operating results in reflected a net loss of million  compared to net income of million in due to significantly higher foreign loan loss provisions see credit risk reserve for loan losses 
pacific century controls its risk exposure to international lending by evaluating the political and economic factors that bear on a country s ability to meet its foreign debt obligations 
based on these analyses  credit limits both short and long term are established for each country to minimize and control risk in the international portfolio 
these credit limits are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis so that risks and exposures are understood and properly assessed 
pacific century s strategy for foreign lending is to deal  on a direct basis  primarily with countries and companies that have a strong trade and investment interest in hawaii and asia pacific region 
pacific century s foreign lending consists of both local currency and cross border lending 
local currency loans are those that are funded and will be repaid in the currency of the borrower s country 
cross border lending  on the other hand  involves loans that will be repaid in a currency other than that of the borrower s country 
this type of lending involves greater risk because the borrower s ability to repay is additionally dependent on changes in the currency exchange rate 
cross border interbank placements and loans were million at year end table presents  for the last three years  a geographic distribution of international assets for which pacific century has cross border exposure exceeding of total assets 
the countries in asia to which pacific century maintains its largest credit exposure on a cross border basis include south korea  japan and taiwan 
at december   cross border credit exposure in japan  south korea  and taiwan were million  million and million  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  at december  in japan and taiwan  despite pressures from neighboring countries  the high levels of foreign exchange reserves have helped to maintain relative economic stability 
at pacific century  all exposures relating to south korea  japan  taiwan  hong kong  the philippines and malaysia ended both december  and on a performing status 
with the implementation of the international monetary fund imf restructuring plan in late and throughout  south korea s foreign exchange reserves have significantly improved and rating agencies have gradually raised south korea s sovereign rating back to investment grade 
our experience and history in the country continue to give us confidence in our ability to manage our exposure in south korea 
pacific century s lending in south korea is focused on trade related activities and is mostly short term in nature 
most of the south korean loans are to financial institutions eg  national and regional banks or to the top five major conglomerates 
in the first quarter of  pacific century exchanged million of short term loans to korean banks into government guaranteed loans 
these loans mature over three years and bear interest at to over the six month london interbank offering rate 
during  there were no charge offs taken on any south korean loan 
within asia  the two most problematic economies for pacific century remain thailand and indonesia 
the financial and liquidity problems in thailand and indonesia required the intervention of the imf 
pacific century s cross border credit assets in thailand and indonesia at december  were approximately million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  at year end in the first quarter of  million in us dollar denominated thai finance company loans were exchanged for thai baht denominated government deposits 
charge offs relative to thai exposures in totaled million  while recoveries were million 
total thai non performing credits at december  were million  down from million at year end with respect to indonesia  non performing credits totaled million at december  during  million in exposures to indonesian banks were converted to sovereign risk in conjunction with a government sponsored plan to support the local banking system 
the converted loans mature over four years 
overall at the end of  the imf has praised the steps that thailand has taken to recover from its economic turmoil 
indonesia remains volatile as it attempts to sort through its economic and political problems 
in view of the risks  pacific century increased its provision for loan losses in as more fully discussed in the section on credit risk reserve for loan losses 
pacific century continues to monitor its international activities on a country by country basis as events evolve and will take such actions as appropriate 
pacific century believes that it has prudently managed its exposure in asia and has dealt with the known situations 
however  because of the uncertainties  it is difficult to accurately predict the impact of the turmoil in asia on the economies of hawaii and the us mainland  changes in currencies of pacific region countries relative to the us dollar  changes in interest rates  and changes in applicable us and foreign regulatory and monetary policy 
moreover  it is not known what  if any  further impact there will be on pacific century s asian exposure resulting from future events

at year end  the ratio of npas to outstanding loans rose to 
comparatively the ratio was and for and  respectively 
table presents pacific century s npas and ratio of npas to total loans for the last five years 
in order to minimize credit losses  pacific century strives to maintain high underwriting standards  identify potential problem loans early and work with borrowers to cure delinquencies 
moreover  charge offs  if required  are taken promptly and reserve levels are maintained at adequate levels 
pacific century s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when a loan is over days delinquent  unless collection is likely based on specific factors such as the type of borrowing agreement and or collateral 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current earnings 
total non accrual loans rose to million at year end  up over year end higher non accrual balances in the foreign and commercial loan categories accounted for most of this increase 
relative to the end of s third quarter  non accrual loans reflected a decrease of million 
at december   foreign loans on non accrual were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase relative to primarily reflects a million rise in non accrual loans in the south pacific from million at year end to million at year end new caledonia accounts for most of the higher non accruals in the south pacific  reporting a year to year increase of million from million at year end to million at year end in french polynesia non accrual loans remained relatively flat at million at december   compared to million at the year earlier date 
included in the non accrual totals for both new caledonia and french polynesia were the effects of the banque paribas acquisitions 
in asia  loans reported as non accrual at december  were approximately million  down from million at december  additional information relative to asian exposure is contained in the international operations section of this report 
c i loans classified as non accrual totaled million at year end  an increase from million and million at year end and  respectively 
contributing to the increase was the addition of a hawaii based loan of million for which partial charge offs were taken in at december   non accrual loans secured by real estate totaled million  or of total non accrual loans  with the majority of these loans secured by residential real estate in hawaii 
non performing residential mortgages excluding construction loans totaled million at year end  compared to million at year end  reflecting a year over year increase of million 
although residential mortgage non accruals have increased  charge offs for this billion portfolio have remained low at million in compared to million in because residential mortgages are secured by real estate  the credit risk on these loans are lower than for unsecured lending 
most of the company s residential loans are owner occupied first mortgages and were generally underwritten to provide a loan to value ratio of no more than at origination 
additionally  the risk in this portfolio is also moderated by the smaller average loan balance compared to commercial lending 
foreclosed real estate declined to million at year end  from million at year end at december   the foreclosed real estate portfolio consisted of properties  mostly located in hawaii

the reserve level is determined based on a continuing assessment of problem credits  recent loss experience  changes in collateral values  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
pacific century s credit administration procedures emphasizes the early recognition and monitoring of problem loans in order to control delinquencies and minimize losses 
for loans other than consumer loans  a line driven risk rating system is used 
loans are graded based on the degree of risk at origination by the lending officer and thereafter  are reviewed periodically as appropriate 
an independent evaluation of this process is performed by the credit review department to ensure compliance of the risk grades and timeliness of grade changes 
pacific century performs a comprehensive quarterly analysis to determine the adequacy of its reserve for loan losses 
in  this analysis was enhanced to incorporate risk migration modeling and country risk 
pacific century utilizes a methodology that establishes both specific and general reserves 
commercial loans and leases are individually reviewed according to specified criteria to determine specific loss exposure 
loans for which a specific reserve allocation is not established are placed in loan pools for purposes of determining the general reserve allocation 
at pacific century  general reserve allocations for various loan pools are determined based on a risk migration analysis component and a subjective factors component 
the migration model determines potential loss factors based on historical loss experience for homogeneous loan portfolios and based on risk grades for risk rated portfolios 
the subjective factors component includes an evaluation of the changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  delinquency and non accrual trends  lending policies and procedures  and other relevant general factors 
for foreign credits  general reserves are further stratified to address country risk 
general reserve allocations for country risk are determined based on the type of credit facility and internal country risk ratings 
the reserve for loan losses ended at million  an increase of million over the prior year level of million 
this increase reflects million in reserves acquired from the banque paribas acquisitions and a build up of reserves to cover the increase in npas 
net charge offs in were million or of average loans  compared to million  or of average loans in and million  or of average loans in the ratio of reserves to loans outstanding at year end was  compared with at year end and at year end a summary of the activity in the reserve for loan losses for the last five years is presented in table at year end  the reserve for loan losses provided coverage of of non performing loans  compared to coverage at year end and at year end additionally  the ratio of year end reserves to gross charge offs was times  times  and times in   and  respectively

market risk at pacific century  assets and liabilities are managed to maximize long term risk adjusted returns to shareholders 
pacific century s asset and liability management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling and managing financial risks that can significantly impact the company s financial position and operating results 
financial risks in the form of interest rate sensitivity  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  liquidity  and capital adequacy are balanced with expected returns to maximize earnings performance and shareholder value  while limiting the volatility of each 
the activities associated with these financial risks are categorized into other than trading or trading 
other than trading activities in the normal course of business  elements of pacific century s balance sheet are exposed to varying degrees of market risk 
market risk arises from movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by the board of directors and senior management as to the level of such risk assumed by pacific century in its balance sheet 
the board reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines and delegates to the asset liability management committee alco oversight functions 
the alco  consisting of the managing committee and senior business and finance officers  monitors pacific century s market risk exposure and as market conditions dictate  modifies balance sheet positions or directs the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk 
pacific century s balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from the company s normal business activities of making loans and taking deposits 
many other factors also affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
these factors include general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and historical pricing spread relationships 
a key element in the company s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income nii simulation model 
this model is used to estimate the amount that nii will change over a one year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios 
these estimates are based on numerous assumptions that include loan and deposit volumes and pricing  prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the nii simulation model provides a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of nii s exposure to higher or lower interest rates 
table presents as of december  and  the estimate of the change in nii from a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  over the next month period relative to what the nii would have been if interest rates did not change 
the resulting estimate in nii exposure is well within the approved alco guidelines and presents a balance sheet exposure that is slightly liability sensitive 
a liability sensitive exposure would imply a favorable short term impact on nii in periods of declining interest rates 
market risk exposure to interest rate changes table december  december  interest rate interest rate change change in basis points in basis points estimated exposure as a percent of net interest income to enhance and complement the results from the nii simulation model  pacific century also reviews other measures of interest rate risk 
these measures include the sensitivity of market value of equity and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures but used along with the nii simulation model  pacific century gets a better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risks  the company uses several approaches  both on and off balance sheet  to modify its risk position 
approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include changing product pricing strategies  modifying investment portfolio strategies  or using financial derivatives 
the use of financial derivatives  as detailed in note o to the consolidated financial statements  has been limited over the past several years 
during this period  pacific century has relied more on the use of on balance sheet alternatives to manage its interest rate risk position 
foreign currency risk 
pacific century s broad area of operations throughout the south pacific and asia has the potential to expose the company to foreign currency risk 
in general  however  most foreign currency denominated assets are funded by like currency liabilities  with imbalances corrected through the use of various hedge instruments as disclosed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 
by policy  the net exposure in those balance sheet activities described above is insignificant 
on the other hand  pacific century is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate changes from the capital invested in its foreign subsidiaries and branches located throughout the south pacific and asian rim 
these investments are designed to diversify the company s total balance sheet exposure 
while a portion of the capital investment in french polynesia and new caledonia is offset by a borrowing denominated in french francs or foreign exchange currency hedge transactions  the remainder of these capital positions  aggregating million  are not hedged 
pacific century uses a value at risk var calculation to measure the potential loss from foreign currency exposure 
pacific century s var is calculated at a confidence interval and assumes a normal distribution 
pacific century utilizes the variance covariance approach to estimate the probability of future changes in foreign exchange rates 
under this approach  equally weighted daily closing prices are used to determine the daily volatility for the last    and days 
pacific century uses the highest daily volatility of the four trading periods in its var calculation 
to estimate the potential loss in its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and branches  pacific century takes the daily volatility and annualizes it by multiplying by the number of trading days in a year 
therefore  the var determines the potential one year loss within a confidence interval of the net investment in subsidiaries 
in other words  a loss greater than var has approximately a probability of occurring

these transactions are executed on behalf of customers and for the company s own account 
pacific century  however  manages its trading account such that it does not maintain significant foreign currency open positions 
to measure the exposure of these open positions  the company uses the var methodology described above 
the var measurement for trading activities as of year end continues to be immaterial 
liquidity management liquidity is managed to ensure that pacific century has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding to conduct its business in a normal manner 
the company s alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process combined with pacific century s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  pacific century actively manages both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet 
the primary sources of liquidity on the asset side of the balance sheet are available for sale investment securities  interest bearing deposits  and cash flows from loans and investments  as well as the ability to securitize certain assets 
with respect to liabilities  liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and the ability to obtain wholesale funding in national and local markets through a variety of sources 
pacific century obtains short term wholesale funding through federal funds purchased  repos  and commercial paper 
pacific century issues commercial paper in various denominations with maturities of generally days or less 
during  pacific century issued commercial paper only in the hawaii marketplace 
to further enhance liquidity  pacific century also maintains access to the mainland wholesale commercial paper market through a pre selected issuing agent 
repos are financing transactions  whereby securities are pledged as collateral for short term borrowings 
nearly all of pacific century s repos consist of transactions with governmental entities 
pacific century s balance sheet is unique given the high level of state and local government funding 
historically  these governmental entities have provided a stable source of funds 
pacific century maintained a million  annually renewable line of credit for working capital purposes 
fees are paid on the unused balance of the line 
during  the line was not drawn upon 
bank of hawaii and first savings are both members of the federal home loan bank of seattle 
the fhlb provides these institutions with an additional source for short and long term funding 
additionally  bank of hawaii maintains a billion senior and subordinated bank note program 
under this facility  bank of hawaii may issue additional notes provided that at any time the aggregate amount outstanding does not exceed billion 
at december   there were no balances outstanding under this program 
capital management pacific century manages its capital level to optimize shareholder value  support asset growth  reflect risks inherent in its markets  provide protection against unforeseen losses and comply with regulatory requirements 
capital levels are reviewed periodically relative to pacific century s risk profile and current and projected economic conditions 
pacific century s objective is to hold sufficient capital on a regulatory basis to exceed the minimum guidelines of a well capitalized institution 
at year end  pacific century s shareholders equity grew to billion  an increase of over year end the source of growth in shareholders equity in included retention of earnings  issuance of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan and various stock based employee benefit plans  and unrealized valuation adjustments 
offsetting these increases were cash dividends paid of million and treasury stock purchases of million 
pacific century s regulatory capital ratios at year end were tier capital ratio of  total capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of 
all three capital ratios exceeded the minimum threshold levels that were established by federal bank regulators to qualify an institution as well capitalized 
the minimum regulatory standards to qualify as well capitalized are as follows tier capital  total capital  and the leverage ratio 
these standards are minimum regulatory guidelines and pacific century manages its capital base in accordance with the attributes noted at the beginning of this section 
table presents a five year history of activities and balances in pacific century s capital accounts along with key capital ratios 
in december  pacific century completed a million capital securities offering that was issued through bancorp hawaii capital trust i  a newly organized grantor trust 
the capital securities mature in years and bear cumulative dividends at payable semi annually 
proceeds from this issue were used for general corporate purposes 
these capital securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory accounting purposes  but are classified as long term debt in the statement of condition 
in order to maintain its capital position at a desired level  pacific century has repurchased shares  over the past few years  under various stock repurchase programs 
under these programs  approximately million shares in  million shares in and million shares in were repurchased

year a significant issue facing all banks nationwide is the transition to the new millennium 
year concerns arise primarily from past date coding practices in both software and hardware that used two digits rather than four digits to represent years 
if not corrected  systems that use the two digit format will be unable to correctly distinguish dates after december  this problem could cause these systems to fail or produce inaccurate information 
state of readiness the resolution of year issues is a top priority at pacific century 
as a diversified financial services organization  pacific century depends on a variety of systems to operate its businesses in hawaii  the us mainland and the asia pacific region 
recognizing the significant risks associated with the year problem  pacific century established project in as a corporate wide year initiative 
through project  pacific century centrally manages  coordinates and tracks all year compliance activities for its subsidiaries 
pacific century believes that its level of preparedness is appropriate to address year issues in a timely manner and has developed a project plan that is designed to renovate both critical information technology and non information technology assets in a timely manner 
pacific century s year program management is structured around an executive technology council the etc and program management office the pmo 
the etc  which is comprised of executive officers of pacific century and its subsidiaries  maintains a corporation wide focus on year compliance efforts 
year compliance activities are coordinated by the pmo across all lines of business and geographic regions to ensure consistency in project management elements throughout the enterprise 
incorporated in pacific century s year project plan are the following five phases awareness 
this phase consisted of securing executive level support needed to achieve year compliance 
in addition  this phase required the establishment of a year program team and the development of an overall strategy that encompassed internal systems  service providers for systems that are outsourced  vendors  customers  counterparties and suppliers 
pacific century has completed the awareness phase 
assessment 
this phase consisted of identifying the software  hardware  networks  processing platforms  non technology assets and customers and vendors that are affected by the year date change 
in addition  this phase also addressed the size and complexity of the year issues  as well as  identified and developed the resources necessary to perform compliance work 
pacific century has completed the assessment phase 
renovation 
the renovation phase included work required to bring products and services into year compliance ie  code enhancements  hardware  and software replacements  and vendor certification 
detailed analyses were performed to determine the impact of the required changes on related applications and hardware 
work was prioritized based on information gathered during the assessment phase 
the determining factor in the decision to repair  replace  or risk accept an asset was based on the criticality of an asset to the operation of a business unit 
for pacific century  of the mission critical systems have been renovated as of december  validation testing 
this phase consists of testing information technology and non information technology assets 
during the initial phase of testing  the functionality of the year modified system is tested to demonstrate that changes made to data processing do not disrupt the daily processing of the system 
next  the year modified application is tested together with related applications to ensure that it can be safely integrated into production without negatively impacting related applications 
before the modified application is placed into production  it is reviewed  tested and approved by end users in the business units 
as of december   pacific century has completed approximately of the validation testing of its critical systems 
in addition  the validation phase also addresses external testing with third party and service provider systems for year compliance 
the bulk of third party interface testing will be conducted during the first quarter of implementation 
in the implementation phase systems which have been tested as year compliant are migrated into production 
as each renovated system passes the final quality assurance review  it is placed into production 
as of december   the implementation phase has been completed for approximately of pacific century s critical systems 
pacific century expects to have all of its critical systems fully implemented into production by the end of june pacific century understands that successfully addressing the year issue extends well beyond the remediation of internal systems 
pacific century has a detailed and extensive process to ascertain and monitor the year readiness of its vendors and service providers 
additionally  pacific century has embarked on a year risk assessment program to determine the year readiness of all material customers  counterparties and business partners 
estimated year costs pacific century estimates that costs directly related to project issues will approximate million  including million in estimated incremental cost 
costs associated with project primarily include estimates for technology and program management staff  staff retention  consultant fees  and software and hardware costs  as well as  costs for customer education and public relations 
through december   cumulative costs for project totaled approximately million of which approximately million were incurred in as project progresses  the cost estimate could change depending on a number of factors  including the failure of third party vendors to address year issues in a timely manner 
year compliance costs are expected to be funded from operating cash flow 
contingency plans and risks while pacific century believes its year project plan is designed to be successful in resolving year issues it is possible  that not all potential problems will be satisfactorily addressed in a timely manner 
to mitigate this possibility  pacific century has developed remediation contingency plans and is developing business continuity contingency plans 
remediation contingency plans are intended to mitigate risks associated with potential delays in completing the renovation  validation or implementation phases for pacific century s critical systems 
these plans include specific trigger dates to activate actions that are designed to minimize potential material disruptions 
as of december   pacific century has developed remediation contingency plans for all critical systems 
business continuity plans address the actions that would be taken if critical functions could not be carried out in their normal manner on january  and the period thereafter  as a result of year related information system  embedded system  or external party failure 
the process for developing these plans calls for identifying specific failure scenarios and determining their significance  developing alternative solutions to mitigate business disruptions  and testing the effectiveness of the plan 
pacific century expects to complete its business continuity contingency plans by june  pacific century expects to successfully complete its year program in a timely and effective manner 
as of december   pacific century was in compliance with all federal financial institution examination council guidelines relating to year however  because of the extensiveness  complexity  and uniqueness of the year problem  there can be no assurance that pacific century will be completely successful in its efforts to address year issues 
for example  there can be no assurance that all systems external to pacific century will be year ready by january   or by some earlier date  in order not to create a material disruption to pacific century s business 
pacific century is also subject to credit risk to the extent borrowers fail to adequately address year issues 
if  despite diligent  prudent efforts under its year plan  there are year related failures that create substantial disruptions to pacific century s business  the adverse effect of such failures could have a material impact on pacific century s results of operations and financial condition 
however  no significant adverse events have been currently identified 
moreover  the estimated costs  referred to above  of implementing the plan do not take into account the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of year related failures that could occur despite implementation of the plan 
forward looking statements contained in the above year disclosure should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements included in the introductory section of this report under overview forward looking statements 
european economic and monetary union on january   eleven members of the european union introduced a new common currency called the euro 
the full implementation to the euro will occur over a transition period 
initially  the participating countries will turn over their monetary policies exchange and rate setting to a new european central bank 
additionally  the sovereign debt of participating countries will be exclusively issued in euro  and outstanding sovereign debt will be redenominated 
between and the currencies of the participating countries will remain legal tender as denominations of the euro 
beginning january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for use in cash transactions 
by july  all legacy currencies will cease to be legal tender 
included in the conversion to the euro is the french franc 
prior to january   the pacific franc  the currency of french polynesia and new caledonia  was pegged to the french franc 
the pacific franc will not convert to the euro 
instead  the french government has pegged the pacific franc to the euro in the same equivalent relationship as the former fixed translation with the french franc 
the conversion to the euro currency is not expected to have a significant impact on the operations or financial results of pacific century 
pacific century has performed an internal analysis for the euro conversion 
currently  operational systems and procedures are euro compliant  which enable pacific century to perform euro related transactions 
costs associated with the euro conversion were not significant
