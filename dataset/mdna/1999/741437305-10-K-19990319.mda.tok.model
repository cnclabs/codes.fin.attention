accounting policies for financial reporting purposes  the company reports of revenues and expenses for the markets for which it provides cellular telephone service 
however  in several of its markets  the company holds less than of the equity ownership 
the minority stockholders and partners share of income or losses in those markets are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as minority interest share of income losses  except for losses in excess of their capital accounts and cash call provisions which are not eliminated in consolidation 
for financial reporting purposes  the company consolidates each subsidiary and partnership in which it has a controlling interest greater than in each 
year impact the company is in the process of reviewing the full impact that the year could have on its operational and financial systems 
the company has chosen our current billing provider to coordinate the testing of all of the operating and financial systems that could affect the company s operations 
several of these systems such as the point of sale system  the prepaid calling system  wide area network and local area network  and the general ledger system are currently integrated into the billing system 
the company s current billing vendor has committed to test the compliance of the above systems with the year requirements by reviewing each system s upgrade releases which these third party providers maintain will make them year compliant 
most of these system party providers deal with other cellular companies  which enables the company to leverage the knowledge obtained from servicing other cellular and telecommunications companies 
the company anticipates that this will reduce the testing and validation time necessary for a comprehensive review 
in addition to the testing of third party provider systems  the current billing provider will review their own internal operating systems to verify year compliance 
they will then test the integration of the updated year versions with their upgraded version to ensure compliance 
the company  with the billing provider s guidance  has formulated its strategy after analyzing all systems that could have an effect on our operations and prioritizing the impact into high  medium  and low risk 
the company estimates that the total costs of these testing and upgrading procedures will be less than million 
however  the company is unable to predict all of the implications of the year issue as it relates to its suppliers and other entities 
it is anticipated that the substantial portion of these costs will be incurred during and will be expensed when incurred 
the company has investigated the possibility of establishing a contingency plan in the event the above is not successful 
its dependence on a few key third party providers for most companies in the industry and therefore the lack of accessibility of alternative systems make a contingency plan impractical 
inflation the company believes that inflation affects its business no more than it generally affects other similar businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company utilizes fixed rate debt instruments to fund its acquisitions 
management believes that the use of fixed rate debt minimizes the company s exposure to market conditions and the ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable rate financing
