the company also has obligations at december  to purchase and leaseback seven facilities subject to term or construction loans to genesis or genesis equity investees  upon the earlier of the maturity of the related loans or the facilities reaching average monthly occupancy of at least for three consecutive months 
the purchase price for these facilities is based upon each facility s net operating income at the acquisition date and a formula agreed to on the transaction s original commencement date 
these amounts cannot be estimated at this time due to the status of the operations of the facilities underlying the related term and construction loans 
the company also has an option at december  to purchase and leaseback one facility subject to a construction loan to an unaffiliated company for million upon the earlier of the maturity of the related loan or the facility reaching average monthly occupancy of at least for three consecutive months 
the company does not expect to be required to purchase any of these facilities before september the company may be limited in its ability to fund these purchases or exercise its purchase option due to limited availability of funds under the credit facility 
a portion or all of the purchase price for these acquisitions will be reduced by any remaining balance outstanding under the related term and construction loans 
contemporaneously with the closing of the offering  the company entered into the million credit facility with deutsche bank  which expired january  the credit facility enables the company to borrow generally at floating rates based on a margin over the one month london interbank borrowing rate libor  as determined by the percentage of the credit facility outstanding as compared to the borrowing base 
at december   the margin was over libor for an aggregate rate of  based on a borrowing base of million 
the balance outstanding under the credit facility at december  was million 
the credit facility contains various financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  minimum equity value  minimum tangible net worth  a total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 
because the credit facility is floating rate debt  fluctuations in prevailing interest rates will impact the company s interest expense in connection with borrowings under the credit facility 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the original expiration date of the credit facility was extended on january  to april   and the availability under the credit facility was reduced to million 
in addition  the million in letters of credit originally available under the credit facility were canceled 
during this extension period  the company notified deutsche bank that it was in violation of certain restrictive covenants under the credit facility which occurred principally as a result of the company s equity value market value of outstanding shares being less than million as of february  the company declared and made shareholder distributions and borrowed additional funds for working capital during february  prior to the determination that the company was in violation of the minimum equity value covenant 
as a result  additional borrowings were not permitted under the credit facility while a technical default existed 
on march   the term of the credit facility was extended from april  to january  through an amendment which also waived the company s defaults under the credit facility and provided for available borrowings up to an aggregate of million 
the company had million of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility at march   which included the million extension fee paid in connection with this amendment 
the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will increase from a basis point margin over one month libor to a basis point margin effective june  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at march  was  including the basis point margin 
the company expects net cash provided by operations and funds available under the credit facility to be sufficient to enable it to meet its short term cash flow requirements through december   including the funding of construction commitments and shareholder distributions 
the company does not have availability under the current credit facility to finance acquisitions consistent with its long term growth strategy 
the company expects to meet its long term cash flow requirements for the funding of future construction commitments and real estate property development and acquisitions by borrowing and by issuing equity or debt securities in public or private transactions 
the company believes that it will be able to obtain financing for its long term capital needs 
however  due to recent illiquidity in the capital markets and uncertainty concerning the economy  there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
subject to the availability of capital in the credit markets  the company may  under certain circumstances  borrow additional amounts in connection with the renovation or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of additional properties  or as necessary  to meet certain distribution requirements imposed on reits under the tax code 
the company has entered into discussions with potential sources to replace the credit facility with new financing which would provide longer term funding to support the company s objectives 
if the company is unable to raise additional capital through equity financing  or is unable to increase its borrowing capacity  the company may be limited in its ability to fully implement its growth strategy 
additionally  if the company is unable to obtain replacement financing by january   or is unable to negotiate a further extension to the current credit facility at that time  deutsche bank could exercise its right to foreclose on the collateral securing the credit facility  which would have a significant adverse affect on the company s ability to continue its operations and meet its obligations  including payment of quarterly shareholder distributions 
to qualify as a reit  the company must distribute to its shareholders each year at least of its net taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
if the company is unable to make required shareholder distributions  then the company may be unable to qualify as a reit and be subject to federal income taxes 
the interest rate on replacement financing may be significantly higher than the interest rate on the existing credit facility 
additionally  the company may be required to pay significant financing fees in the future in connection with replacement financing or negotiating a further extension with deutsche bank 
increased interest rates or significant financing fees would reduce the company s cash flow and affect its ability to continue to maintain distributions to its shareholders at current levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all  or that  if obtained  it will be able to continue making distributions to its common shareholders at previous levels 
facilities owned by the company and leased to third parties under percentage and minimum rent triple net leases require the lessee to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation of such facilities 
percentage and minimum rent leases represent of the company s leased properties at december  as a result of these arrangements  the company does not believe it will be responsible for significant expenses in connection with the facilities during the terms of the leases 
the company anticipates entering into similar leases with respect to additional properties acquired 
however  there can be no assurance the company will not be responsible for significant expenses of its leased properties in the event one or more of its lessees default on their leases with the company 
in august  the company implemented a share repurchase program 
under the share repurchase program  the company from time to time may repurchase shares in open market transactions up to an amount equal to the company s excess cash flow on a quarterly and cumulative basis 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased  common shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company s ability to repurchase shares in the future will be dependent upon the company having sufficient excess funds to repurchase shares 
distributions to shareholders subsequent to year end the board of trustees declared a cash distribution on february  the cash distribution of per share was paid on or about february   to common shareholders of record on february  there can be no assurance that distributions will continue to be made or that the level of distributions will be maintained in future periods at the same level as funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in march defines funds from operations as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes funds from operations using standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term using the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities using generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
the following table presents the company s funds from operations for the period from the company s offering on january  to december  in thousands funds from operations net income  minority interest net income before minority interest  adjustments to derive funds from operations add real estate depreciation and amortization  including amounts related to unconsolidated entities  nonrecurring items start up expenses  funds from operations before allocation to minority interest  less funds from operations allocable to minority interest funds from operations attributable to the common shareholders  impact of inflation earnings of the company are primarily long term investments with fixed interest rates 
these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity  long term mortgages and borrowings under the revolving lines of credit 
during inflationary periods  which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates  the company s ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs 
new accounting pronouncements see the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes for information relating to the impact on the company of new accounting pronouncements 
year considerations the company recognizes that the year problem could affect its operations as well as the proper functioning of the embedded systems included in the company s properties 
in any particular property  the problem could affect the functioning of elevators  heating and air conditioning systems  security systems and other automated building systems 
the nature of the company s business is such that most of its assets are subject to triple net lease arrangements with healthcare facility operators under which the operators are obligated to remedy  at their own expense  any year problems pertaining to the properties 
the company is currently discussing with these operators their plans to identify and address any such problems in a manner that does not impair the operators ability to continuously operate the property involved 
in addition  as genesis represents a significant source of the company s rental and interest revenue  the company is discussing with genesis its preparedness for the year so as to assess their ability to meet their obligations  both in terms of facility repairs and ability to generate payments  in a timely manner 
the company has also begun to evaluate the year readiness of those properties not subject to triple net lease arrangements  which principally includes the company s medical and other office buildings  through identifying and contacting suppliers of building systems and other critical business partners to determine if the building systems are affected and whether these entities have an effective plan in place to address the year issue 
the company has evaluated its own internal systems to determine the impact of year due principally to the company s small size and low transactional volume  the year issue is not expected to have a significant impact on corporate operations 
the company does not expect its costs of achieving year compliance to exceed  the company has not developed a formal contingency plan for year issues which may arise 
however  a contingency plan will be established prior to december  once the company has completed its year evaluation of its properties and lessees 
with respect to the year compliance of critical third parties  the company s lessees and borrowers who operate skilled nursing facilities derive a substantial portion of their revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
congress general accounting office gao concluded in september that it would be highly unlikely that all medicare systems will be compliant on time to ensure the delivery of uninterrupted benefits and services into the year while these operators do not receive payments directly from medicare  but from intermediaries  the gao statement is interpreted to apply as well to these intermediaries 
recently  the health care financing administration hcfa administrator asserted that all systems necessary to make payments to fiscal intermediaries would be compliant 
the hcfa administrator provided further assurance that intermediary systems would also be compliant well in advance of the deadline 
any delays in these operators receiving payments in connection with year issues could impact their ability to make required rent and debt payments to the company 
however  based upon discussions with some of these operators  including genesis  these companies intend to actively confirm the year readiness status for each intermediary and to work cooperatively to ensure appropriate continuing payments for services rendered to all government insured patients 
there can be no assurance the company has adequately assessed or identified all aspects of its business which may be impacted by year issues which may arise after december  additionally  there can be no assurance that the company s lessees or borrowers or other third parties  such as medicare intermediaries  will adequately address and correct any and all year issues that may arise after december  a failure by the company s lessees or borrowers to be year compliant  or significant delays in them receiving payments for services from other third parties could significantly impact the company s ability to collect its rent and debt payments  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of the foregoing  there can be no assurance that year computer problems which may impact the company or its lessees or borrowers will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investments in real estate loans receivable bear interest at fixed rates 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying loan receivable  but not earnings or cash flows 
assuming the repayment terms and additional commitments of the loans receivable existing at december   a one percent change in the interest rates would change the fair value of these loans receivable by approximately  the carrying amount of the loans receivable approximates their fair value at december  the company s mortgages and bonds payable bear interest at fixed rates 
the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its credit facility 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the company provides fixed rate mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of its normal operations 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying indebtedness  but not earnings or cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
the maturity schedule for the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable is as follows thereafter  the carrying amount of the mortgages and bonds payable approximates their fair value at december  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows
