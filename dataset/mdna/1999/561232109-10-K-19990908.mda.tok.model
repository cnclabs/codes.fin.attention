item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
mallinckrodt inc and its subsidiaries  collectively  are called the company or mallinckrodt 
all references to years are to fiscal years ended june unless otherwise stated 
the consolidated financial statements were restated for a reduction in purchased research and development and a corresponding increase in goodwill  which resulted in an increase in amortization expense 
certain amounts in prior years were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
all earnings per share amounts are calculated on a diluted basis unless otherwise stated 
overview vs 
in  mallinckrodt had earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share 
the company incurred a loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  for the results of operations included nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges related to the acquisition of nellcor puritan bennett incorporated nellcor in august which totaled million net of taxes  or per share 
excluding these charges  earnings from continuing operations would have been million  or per share 
the earnings from continuing operations and per share results represent improvements of percent and percent  respectively  when compared to results after excluding the nonrecurring charges 
this year over year improvement is primarily attributable to operating earnings improvement in the respiratory and pharmaceuticals segments of the company s operations while profitability of the imaging segment declined 
net earnings for were million  or per share as compared to a net loss of million  or per share during the prior year 
net earnings for included an after tax gain of million on the sale of the remaining operation of the catalysts and chemical additives division which was reclassified to discontinued operations in the net loss in included an after tax gain of million associated with the completed sales and results of operations of the catalysts and chemical additives and aero systems divisions 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an after tax charge of million related to settlement costs from the sale of the animal health business in the prior year 
the net loss for also included an after tax charge of million for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for the early adoption of a new standard of accounting related to previously capitalized start up costs 
net sales for increased percent to billion compared with billion in sales to customers outside the us were million or percent of total sales 
the year to year sales comparison benefited from the fact that sales only included sales of nellcor after the acquisition which occurred on august  the acquisition of nellcor was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of nellcor have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since september  the purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon generally accepted accounting principles and estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as a result of the nellcor acquisition  purchased research and development valued at million was charged to operations during the first quarter of the purchased research and development represents the value of numerous new medical devices and other products technologies underway in all major product lines of nellcor that were in various stages of development and had not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition 
the value represents the projected net cash flows based upon management s estimates of future revenues and expected profitability of each product technology 
the projected net cash flows were discounted at a rate which accounts for the time value of money as well as the risks of realization of the cash flows 
the discounted cash flows were then reduced to reflect only the accomplishments made by nellcor through the acquisition date toward the products ultimate completion 
the largest components of purchased research and development were in the pulse oximetry  including perinatal  and the hospital ventilator businesses which represent approximately percent and percent  respectively  of purchased research and development 
the pulse oximetry projects underway at the date of acquisition related to development of new monitors and disposable sensors 
the most significant project involves a new family of products that provide enhanced capabilities and ease of use 
this project anticipated sales revenue to begin in with many of the products features of this new family of products still in development  the market release dates for all the items in this line of next generation products has not been finalized 
the other major project within oximetry is the development of a fetal oximeter  a new monitor to directly measure fetal oxygenation during labor and delivery 
this perinatal product is intended to provide reassurance to obstetricians when a baby is adequately oxygenated in the presence of a non reassuring fetal heart rate fhr 
in this common situation  a cesarean section is often performed due to concern for possible fetal distress as suggested by the fhr pattern 
unfortunately  since a non reassuring fhr is an indirect indicator of fetal hypoxia with poor specificity  many of these cesarean sections are retrospectively seen to be unnecessary 
by providing a direct measure of oxygenation  the fetal oximeter may help prevent unnecessary cesarean sections for suspected fetal distress 
although mallinckrodt and several partners are already marketing this technology in more than countries  it is pending final pma submission in the united states 
sales to date are below original projections because the company expected a large percentage of global revenue to be generated in the united states due to its relatively high birth rate utilizing cesarean section 
the most significant projects in development in the hospital ventilator business at the date of acquisition were the models and ventilators 
these hospital ventilators were expected to be commercially available in the us within two years of the acquisition date 
all three models received us food and drug administration fda market clearance by december actual revenues of these projects have experienced shortfalls when compared to revenue estimates as of the acquisition date 
these shortfalls are primarily attributable to delays in receiving regulatory clearance to market and problems with production ramp up activities which often occur in the early stages of manufacturing a new product 
these factors are no longer concerns and  although sales were less than expected in  the ramp up in was consistent with our expectations 
revenue shortfalls experienced to date are not indicative of any expected inability of these products to meet customer needs or their long term revenue expectations 
although market release dates for the most significant in process projects and acquired technologies discussed above have experienced delays  the projections of total revenues to be generated and estimated costs to complete that were developed at acquisition date were appropriate 
based upon results to date  the major risks associated with completion and commercialization of these products are to transform concepts into designs that meet customer requirements  gain regulatory approval and market clearance in key markets  and ramp up the manufacturing process once regulatory approval is obtained 
actual revenue shortfalls  which have occurred to date in these businesses when compared with projections developed at the date of acquisition  are not expected to materially reduce the expected long term revenues of these products  but only the timing of the receipt of these revenues 
material negative variations from the projected results  should they occur  will reduce the expected rate of return on the investment to acquire nellcor and negatively impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
immediately after the acquisition of nellcor was consummated  management of the combined company formulated an integration plan to combine mallinckrodt and nellcor into one company 
since both companies mallinckrodt and nellcor had global healthcare operations  senior management  through transition teams  assessed which activities should be consolidated 
management finalized and approved a nellcor integration plan during accordingly  the company recorded additional purchase liabilities during of million  million net of related tax benefit  which were included in the acquisition cost allocation and related goodwill 
the principal actions of the plan included the involuntary severance of approximately nellcor employees as a result of work force reduction primarily in us administrative areas at a cost of million  relocation of nellcor employees at a cost of million  and the elimination of contractual obligations of nellcor which had no future economic benefit at a cost of million 
the actual number of employees terminated was approximately million of cash expenditures were incurred through june  and liabilities of million related to the nellcor integration plan remained in accrued liabilities at june  in june  the estimated liability was reduced by million  million net of related tax benefit  with a corresponding million reduction of goodwill primarily as a result of reduced severance costs 
the remaining cash expenditures will occur in and  although none are expected  further reductions in the estimated liability for these integration activities will be offset against the related goodwill 
during  the company recorded a pretax charge to selling  administrative and general expenses of million associated with exiting certain activities related to mallinckrodt operations 
the charge included severance costs of million related to the involuntary severance of approximately mallinckrodt employees as a result of work force reduction primarily in the europe administration function and us sales force  and facility exit costs of million 
the actual number of employees terminated was approximately million of cash expenditures have been incurred through june  in june  the associated accrual was reduced by 
million and credited to selling  administrative and general expenses 
the remaining million cash expenditures will occur in restructuring actions are to be complete in and no further adjustments to the reserve are anticipated 
vs 
during the past two years  mallinckrodt completed the largest acquisition in its history and divested certain businesses to improve the strategic position and focus of the company 
on august   the company acquired nellcor through an agreement to purchase for cash all of the outstanding shares of common stock of nellcor for per share 
the aggregate purchase price of the nellcor acquisition was approximately billion 
nellcor is the worldwide market leader in providing products that monitor  diagnose and treat respiratory impaired patients 
the product lines include pulse oximetry monitors and sensors  critical care and portable ventilators  home oxygen therapy products  sleep apnea diagnostic and therapy products  and medical gas products and distribution systems 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of nellcor have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since september  the purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon generally accepted accounting principles and estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
identifiable intangible assets were purchased research and development  technology  trademarks and trade names  and the assembled work force 
the purchased research and development of million was charged to expense in technology  also referred to as core or base technology and which represents that portion of the existing technology that provides a basis for future generation products as well as existing products  was recorded at million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the remaining identifiable intangible assets of million are being amortized on a straight line basis over to years weighted average life of years 
goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  was million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill directly associated with the nellcor acquisition was million for since the results of nellcor have only been included in the company s consolidated results since september  the amortization for represented ten months of activity 
the company also recorded a deferred tax liability of million  representing the tax effect of timing differences recorded as part of the acquisition 
the company s most significant divestitures were the animal health business and flavors joint venture in and the sale of the catalysts and chemical additives and aero systems divisions in and early in the company now operates predominantly in the healthcare industry and is comprised of three business segments respiratory  imaging and pharmaceuticals 
the company incurred a loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  for due to nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges related to the acquisition of nellcor which totaled million  million net of taxes or per share 
the nonrecurring noncash acquisition charges were purchased research and development and inventory stepped up to fair value 
the purchased research and development valued at million was charged to operations during the first quarter of the components of purchased research and development by business were pulse oximetry including perinatal million  hospital ventilators million  oxygen therapy million  and sleep  alternate care and other million 
of this amount  million related to the respiratory segment and million related to the aero systems division  which was sold and reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of the purchased research and development represents the value of numerous new medical devices and other products technologies in all major product lines that were in various stages of development and had not reached technological feasibility at the transaction date 
no alternative future uses were identified prior to reaching technological feasibility because of the uniqueness of the projects 
additionally  no identifiable alternate markets were established for projects that were in early stages of development 
the most significant acquired projects  based upon discounted cash flows  that were in process at the date of acquisition were in pulse oximetry and hospital ventilation 
pulse oximetry  which includes monitors  sensors  oem and licensing  and related service for all types of patients and environments including perinatal  generated approximately percent of purchased research and development value 
pulse oximetry products provide the continuous measurement of arterial oxygen saturation  pulse rate and pulse strength in a variety of settings and for a spectrum of patients 
the most significant of the pulse oximetry projects underway at the date of acquisition included a new family of monitors and sensors that incorporate new light emitting diode and detector component designs with enhanced motion tolerance capability  packaging and integration of data storage features to allow advanced performance  cost reduction  production automation  size reduction and reduced power requirements 
in the area of fetal pulse oximetry  the major products in development are expected to help lower the risks involved in childbirth by reducing unnecessary cesarean section deliveries 
the company believes fetal pulse oximetry can help clinicians make better informed decisions regarding the status of a fetus during labor and delivery by providing information that helps them determine if the fetus is adequately oxygenated when the heart rate pattern is non reassuring 
these projects are expected to be complete and the related products commercially available in the us within three years of the acquisition date with an expected cost to complete of approximately million 
the hospital ventilation projects generated approximately percent of the purchased research and development value 
hospital ventilators provide ventilation to patients requiring respiratory support 
the most significant projects that were underway at the date of acquisition were models and which were to provide continuous respiratory support for a wide range of pediatric to adult patients for a wide variety of clinical conditions 
the model is a dual microprocessor controlled critical care ventilator for infant  pediatric and adult patients who require either invasive or noninvasive ventilation with features that include a graphic user interface for viewing patient data and setting parameters and alarm values 
the model is a low cost critical care ventilator with a new engine capable of operating with low power consumption 
the model  built on the platform  has pressure and volume control features 
the products were expected to be commercially available within two years of the acquisition date with an estimated cost to complete of approximately million 
all three models received fda market clearance by december oxygen therapy represents the third largest business category of projects in terms of purchased research and development value 
oxygen therapy covers the entire range of functions from oxygen concentrators to portable liquid oxygen  to high pressure oxygen cylinder systems and conservation devices 
the most significant projects underway at the date of acquisition were liquid oxygen systems using cryogenics to reduce the frequency of deliveries  and new oxygen concentrators with features which include reduced noise levels  fewer parts  lighter weight and lower cost to manufacture 
these projects are expected to be complete and the related products commercially available within four years of the acquisition date with an expected cost to complete of approximately million 
the major risks associated with timely completion and commercialization of these products are to transform concepts into designs that meet customer requirements  gain regulatory approval and market clearance in the key markets  and ramp up the manufacturing process once regulatory approval is obtained 
while the assembled work force was valued using the cost approach  the company took the following steps to determine the purchased research and development  developed technology  and trademarks and trade name values 
the projected net cash flows from each product line and new product in development were determined based upon management s estimates of future revenues and expected profitability related to the product portfolio 
these cash flows were then discounted to their present values 
the discount rate includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money as well as the investment risk factors to appropriately reflect the risks of realization of the cash flows 
the projected net cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing discount rates of percent  percent and percent for developed technology  purchased research and development  and trademarks and trade names  respectively 
for the purchased research and development  the discounted cash flows from in process projects were then reduced to reflect only the accomplishments made by nellcor toward the products ultimate completion through the acquisition date 
the projected net cash flows were developed in the following manner 
revenue assumptions were based upon the growth rates for markets served and the estimated life of each product s technology 
significant aggregate revenue growth as projected by the company s strategic marketing units for developed and in process products assumed increasing demand for medical devices  and the company s ability to maintain a significant share of the market 
the projected revenues associated with in process technology increase to million in and then decline over subsequent years  while revenue assumptions for the developed products remain relatively flat in as compared to and then begin to decline gradually in subsequent periods 
the trademark and trade name cash flows were based upon the revenues of both developed and in process products and a percent royalty rate 
costs of goods sold  expressed as a percent of revenue  were expected to decrease from current projections of percent to percent over time 
gross margins  as they relate inversely to costs of goods sold as a percentage of revenue  were assumed to increase  in the aggregate  over time due mainly to improving efficiency in the manufacturing processes and more profitable products having a greater impact on total sales 
selling  general and administration expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  expressed as a percent of revenues were estimated at percent for all periods 
maintenance research and development expense  which includes routine changes  additions and modifications undertaken after a product is introduced to the market  was established at percent of revenue for both developed and in process technologies for all periods 
an after tax cash flow was then calculated by deducting income tax expense and contributory asset charges from operating income 
results through were consistent with the underlying projections and assumptions of revenues to be generated  estimated costs to complete and completion dates for the in process projects and acquired technologies 
material negative variations from the projected results would impact the company s expected return on its investment in nellcor  its future results of operations and financial position 
in  the company received market approval and launched the model and model ventilators 
these products  although delayed approximately three months from expected launch date  have been well accepted in the market place 
the sale of nellcor inventories  which as part of the purchase price allocation were stepped up to fair value  decreased earnings by million  million net of taxes 
the pretax charges to the respiratory segment and aero systems division  which was sold and reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  were million and million  respectively 
with the acquisition complete  the company began integrating the operations of nellcor with those of mallinckrodt s other businesses 
management finalized and approved a nellcor integration plan during accordingly  the company recorded additional purchase liabilities of million  million net of related tax benefit  which were included in the acquisition cost allocation and related goodwill 
in addition  the company recorded pretax charges to operations during of million  million net of taxes  associated with exiting certain activities related to the operation of mallinckrodt prior to the acquisition of nellcor and other integration costs of the combined company 
excluding the nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges in  the company had earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share 
included in these results are after tax charges of million  or cents per share  primarily to increase reserves for nellcor trade receivables and inventory 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  or per share 
the year to year decline in earnings from continuing operations  after excluding nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges  is primarily attributable to selling price reductions and the dilutive effect of the nellcor acquisition related intangible and goodwill amortization expense and interest expense 
the aggregate purchase price of nellcor of approximately billion was paid through use of available cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowings 
the resulting higher interest expense exceeded the operating earnings of the nellcor operations during the competitive demand for selling price reductions from healthcare customer buying groups continued throughout this trend  which is expected to continue  had its most significant impact on the company s imaging segment where the potential for generic competitive products and available manufacturing capacity continue to cause lower prices 
the company recorded a net loss for of million  or per share as compared to net earnings of million  or per share during the prior year 
during  the company sold  or committed to sell  its catalysts and chemical additives and aero systems divisions 
the completed actions resulted in an after tax gain in of million 
the sale of the remainder of the catalysts and chemical additives division on july  resulted in a gain to be included in the results of discontinued operations 
the gains on the completed sales and the results of operations for these divisions have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of and  accordingly  prior year results have also been reclassified 
earnings  net of taxes  of these discontinued operations were million and million for and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an after tax charge of million related to settlement costs from the sale of the animal health business in the prior year 
the net loss for also included an after tax noncash charge of million  or cents per share  for the early adoption of a new standard of accounting related to previously capitalized start up costs 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was recorded in the fourth quarter  but was effective as of july  operating earnings would have been reduced by million after taxes or cents per share had the company not adopted the accounting change 
net earnings for included a million after tax gain from discontinued operations resulting from the march  disposition of fries fries  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary which owned the company s percent interest in tastemaker  the flavors joint venture  and a million after tax loss from discontinued operations resulting from the sale of the animal health segment on june  net sales for increased percent to billion compared with billion in sales to customers outside the us were million or percent of total sales 
excluding sales of nellcor  which was acquired at the end of august  sales were billion which is equal to the prior year 
excluding the acquisition and integration charges discussed above  operating earnings were million  a decrease of million or percent from the prior year 
excluding the results of nellcor and the acquisition and integration charges discussed above  operating earnings were million or percent below the results of million 
the decline in operating earnings was driven by competitive price pressure in the imaging segment and critical care business 
operating results in millions net sales respiratory  imaging pharmaceuticals operating earnings loss respiratory imaging pharmaceuticals corporate expense acquisition and integration charges vs 
operating earnings for were million  which is a percent improvement over the million in excluding acquisition and integration charges associated with the acquisition of nellcor which were discussed previously  and corporate expense 
the respiratory segment  of which nellcor is a part  had sales for of  million  or percent greater than the sales recorded for the segment s sales increase of million was attributable to volume growth of percent  of which percent was due to the inclusion of ten months of nellcor revenue in the percent volume growth in the comparable september through june periods included million or percent overall growth of pulse oximetry  ventilation  service  anesthesiology and respiratory disposables  blood analysis and medical gases 
volume declines of million included million associated with divested business and million in the oxygen therapy  sleep and portable ventilation lines of business 
the volume declines in the on going businesses were primarily due to delayed new product introductions and competitive pressures associated with customer third party reimbursement on existing products in these businesses 
operating earnings of this segment for were million  or percent greater than the million reported for the prior year 
the year to year improvement was primarily attributable to the two additional months of sales and higher sales volumes in product lines generating the highest margins 
the imaging segment s sales in were million  or percent above the sales for the prior year 
the sales increase was attributable to a million increase in sales of nuclear medicine products 
all major product lines contributed to the year over year volume increase of percent  which was offset by price erosion in x ray contrast media 
although price declines of percent in the x ray contrast media portion of the business in were less significant when compared to those experienced in prior years  declines will continue in future periods thus reducing profitability further 
operating earnings for were million  which is percent lower than in the prior year primarily as a result of selling price erosion in x ray contrast media 
the pharmaceuticals segment s sales for were million  or percent above the revenues generated last year 
the sales increase of million was primarily attributable to volume increases in narcotics and drug chemicals of million  which was an increase of percent 
sales volumes of acetaminophen and laboratory and microelectronic chemicals declined percent and percent  respectively 
the decline in acetaminophen sales was primarily due to a late flu season in the us  while the decline in laboratory and microelectronic chemicals was primarily attributable to the weakness in the microchip industry 
price generated a percent increase in sales for the segment when compared to the prior year 
new competitors are expected in narcotics manufacturing during which may negatively impact selling prices 
operating earnings for were million  or percent above prior year primarily as a result of increased sales of higher margin products 
vs 
the company s operating earnings excluding charges related to acquisition and integration activities and corporate expense were million  which represented a percent decline when compared to the prior year 
excluding the results of nellcor  acquired in august  the acquisition and integration charges  and corporate expense  operating earnings would have been million or percent below this earnings decline was attributable to lower selling prices which were only partially offset by higher volume 
the competitive pressures and the demand for price discounts from customer buying groups adversely affected earnings  and this trend is expected to continue 
in response to this market trend  the company entered into a multi year agreement in with premier purchasing partners  lp premier  the largest healthcare purchasing group in the united states 
effective july   premier named mallinckrodt a corporate partner and  accordingly  premier s  hospital and healthcare facilities are provided incentives to use mallinckrodt products 
the respiratory segment  which includes nellcor and the critical care business  reported operating earnings of million  an increase of percent over the results for excluding nellcor  operating earnings were million  a percent decrease from prior year 
the year to year earnings decline was attributable to a sales decline of million resulting from the negative impact of exchange rate movements caused by the strengthening of the us dollar versus major european currencies and the japanese yen  million due to price declines and another million attributable to the divestiture of a product line in september these sales shortfalls were only partially offset by volume increases of million and million in disposable respiratory and anesthesiology product lines  respectively 
the imaging segment had operating earnings of million in  which was a decline of million or percent from the prior year 
the decline in profitability was directly attributable to a sales decline of million from million in to million in all product lines had volume increases which represented an increase of million over the prior year 
in spite of these increases  erosion of selling price accounted for a million sales decline 
the remainder of the shortfall in when compared to was attributable to the impact of exchange rate movements caused by the strengthening of the us dollar versus major european currencies and the japanese yen 
x ray contrast media  the segment s most significant product line  had sales volume increases of million  but price erosion reduced sales by million 
the pricing pressures were most significant in the us where the company and its x ray contrast media competitors utilize price concessions to maintain or grow their shares in a market dominated by large customer buying groups 
the agreement with premier aligns the company with the largest healthcare purchasing group in the us  representing approximately percent of all x ray contrast media purchased 
the premier agreement is believed to be the largest contract ever written for these products 
in spite of cost reductions in x ray contrast media manufacturing and lower operating expenses  the price erosion reduced profitability  and is expected to reduce profitability in future periods but at a lower rate of decline than was experienced in and the pharmaceuticals segment  which includes bulk and dosage pharmaceuticals  peptides  and process  laboratory and microelectronic chemicals  had operating earnings of million  which was million or percent above results for the prior year 
in spite of higher sales  product mix  lower than expected sales of high margin dosage and other specialty products  and the related impact on plant efficiencies negatively impacted operating earnings 
sales were million  which represented an increase of million or percent above results 
the sales increase was partially generated by a million increase in dosage analgesic volume  of which approximately million was attributable to the full year impact from an acquisition in november the remainder of the sales increase was attributable to volume growth in all other product lines 
the impact of buying groups is less evident in the pharmaceuticals segment 
overall  this segment was able to maintain pricing at prior year levels 
corporate matters corporate expense was up million or percent in over  excluding nonrecurring integration charges 
the current year increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with the development and implementation of a cost management and productivity improvement program 
corporate expense in  excluding nonrecurring integration charges  was million or percent below the level 
interest and other nonoperating income  net was only million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
in and  the company generated interest income on cash proceeds from divestiture activities invested in interest bearing securities 
these cash equivalents were utilized to acquire nellcor at the end of august interest expense in was million  which is million below the million for the prior year 
the reduction in interest expense was attributable to lower outstanding debt  as divestiture proceeds generated in and were partially used to reduce short term borrowing  and lower short term borrowing costs 
the interest expense was million higher than was recorded in  primarily a result of borrowings to purchase for cash all the outstanding shares of common stock of nellcor 
the company s effective tax rate was percent in excluding the one time noncash write off of purchased research and development  which related to the nellcor acquisition and which had no tax benefit  the company s effective tax rate in was percent 
the effective tax rate was percent 
financial condition the company s financial resources are expected to continue to be adequate to support existing businesses 
since june   cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
operations provided million of cash  while capital spending totaled million 
the company received million in proceeds from asset disposals and million in proceeds from redemption and sale of investments 
the company s current ratio at june  was debt as a percentage of invested capital was percent at the end of at june   the company had a billion private placement commercial paper program 
the program is backed by a billion revolving credit facility expiring september  the revolving credit facility was reduced from billion in september there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of june  commercial paper borrowings under this program were million as of june  non us lines of credit totaling million were also available  and borrowings under these lines amounted to million at june  the non us lines are cancelable at any time 
in may  a million shelf debt registration was declared effective and at june  the entire amount remained available 
the company has million aggregate principal amount of percent notes  which mature in  and are redeemable at the election of the holder  in whole but not in part  at percent of the principal amount on january  these notes have been reclassified to short term 
the company s board of directors previously authorized repurchase of million shares of common stock and additional repurchases not to exceed cash outlays of million 
share repurchases under these authorizations have totaled million shares  including million shares during estimated capital spending for the year ending june  is approximately million 
year readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of date sensitive devices  systems and computer programs that were deployed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any such technologies may recognize a year containing as the year rather than the year if left unaddressed  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations  under certain circumstances  causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
mallinckrodt has developed and is implementing a comprehensive program to address the year issue 
the program has four major focus areas information technology systems  non information technology systems  products  and key supplier and business partners 
overall  the company has completed its assessment in the above described areas  and has substantially completed required modifications  replacements or conversions 
information technology systems are hardware and software which support business applications 
year compliance for these systems included modification and testing of existing systems and replacement of certain systems with new technologies 
we believe required modifications  replacements and testing of critical systems are approximately percent completed 
non information technology systems embedded systems are used in research and development  manufacturing processes and facility management systems 
we believe all remediation decisions  and modifications and replacements deemed appropriate for critical items  are completed 
compliance status and applicable remediation steps for currently and previously marketed products have been communicated via the internet using a dedicated web page 
modifications necessary to achieve remediation for such products are available to customers in accordance with the above communicated remediation steps 
the company is also assessing the readiness of its key suppliers and business partners to be year compliant 
information requests have been distributed and responses received from virtually all those queried 
to augment these evaluations  more detailed reviews of certain key suppliers and business partners are being conducted 
this part of the program is approximately percent complete and  to date  no matters have been identified from the replies received that would appear to materially affect the operations of the company s businesses 
to further recognize potential adverse impact  the company is developing operating contingency plans to address unanticipated interruptions that could occur in processes  systems and devices that have been assessed  remediated and considered year ready by mallinckrodt and its key suppliers and business partners 
such operating contingency plans are approximately percent finished  with completion expected by september  the program to address year has been underway since february both internal and external resources are being used to assess and modify or replace non compliant technologies  and to appropriately test year modifications and replacements 
the program is being funded through operating cash flows 
the pretax costs incurred for this effort were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in july through december  the company anticipates an additional million in pretax costs for program management and to complete monitoring and evaluations of key suppliers and business partners  program verification and contingency planning 
the cost of the program and the date on which the company believes it will complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
if the modifications and conversions are not made or are not completed timely and operating contingency plans do not work as anticipated  the result could be an interruption  or a failure  of certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially impact and adversely affect the company s results of operation  liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could materially and adversely affect the company 
the company presently believes it has an effective plan to anticipate and resolve any potential year issues in a timely manner  and that  with the completion of the program as scheduled  the possibility of a material interruption of normal operations should be reduced 
european monetary union emu the euro was introduced on january   at which time the eleven participating emu member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
the legacy currencies will continue to be valid as legal tender through june   thereafter  the legacy currencies will be canceled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
the company s european sales offices and various manufacturing and distribution facilities affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the systems issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
the company s legacy currency systems  which have multi currency functionality  were modified at minimal expense to enable them to process euro transactions effective january  the company believes the cost of converting the information technology and other systems to the euro will not be significant  and that such conversions will be completed on a timely basis prior to any anticipated negative impact on the company s operations 
the company is cognizant of the potential business implications of converting to a common currency  however  it is unable to determine  at this time  the ultimate financial impact of the conversion on its operations  if any  given that the impact will be dependent upon the competitive situations which exist in the various regional markets in which the company participates and the potential actions which may or may not be taken by the company s competitors and suppliers 
mallinckrodt believes converting to the euro will have no material impact on the company s currency exchange cost and or risk exposure  continuity of contracts or taxation 
environmental matters the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
in addition  the company is in varying stages of active investigation or remediation of  or is addressing potential claims of  alleged or acknowledged contamination at approximately currently or previously owned or operated sites and at approximately off site locations where its waste was taken for treatment or disposal 
once the company becomes aware of its potential environmental liability at a particular site  the measurement of the related environmental liabilities to be recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts such as the extent and types of hazardous substances at a site  the range of technologies that can be used for remediation  evolving standards of what constitutes acceptable remediation  presently enacted laws and regulations  engineers and environmental specialists estimates of the range of expected clean up costs that may be incurred  prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  and the progress to date on remediation in process 
while the current law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a superfund site  the company s contribution to clean up these sites is expected to be limited  given the number of other companies which have also been named as potentially responsible parties and the volumes of waste involved
