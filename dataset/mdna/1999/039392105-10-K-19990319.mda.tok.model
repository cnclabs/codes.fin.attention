all subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to arch or persons acting on behalf of arch are expressly qualified in their entirety by the discussion under factors affecting future operating results 
overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with arch s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
arch is a leading provider of wireless messaging services  primarily paging services  and is the third largest paging company in the united states based on its million units in service at december  from january  through december   arch s total number of units in service grew at a compound rate on an annualized basis of 
for the same period on an annualized basis  arch s compound rate of internal unit in service growth excluding units added through acquisitions was 
arch derives the majority of its revenues from fixed periodic usually monthly fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed periodic fees without incurrence of additional selling expenses by arch 
arch s service  rental and maintenance revenues and the related expenses exhibit substantially similar growth trends 
arch s average revenue per subscriber has declined over the last three years for two principal reasons i an increase in the number of subscriber owned and reseller owned pagers for which arch receives no recurring equipment revenue and ii an increase in the number of reseller customers whose airtime is purchased at wholesale rates 
the reduction in average paging revenue per subscriber resulting from these trends has been more than offset by the elimination of associated expenses so that arch s margins have improved over such period 
furthermore  recent data indicates such rate of decline has slowed 
arch has achieved significant growth in units in service and adjusted ebitda through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions  including the acquisition of westlink in may arch s total revenues have increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and to million in the year ended december  over the same periods  through operating efficiencies and economies of scale  arch has been able to reduce its per unit operating costs to enhance its competitive position in its markets 
due to the rapid growth in its subscriber base  arch has incurred significant selling expenses  which are charged to operations in the period incurred 
arch had net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired and developed assets and interest charges associated with indebtedness 
however  as its subscriber base has grown  arch s operating results have improved  as evidenced by an increase in it adjusted ebitda from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and to million in the year ended december  ebitda is a commonly used measure of financial performance in the paging industry 
adjusted ebitda is also one of the financial measures used to calculate whether arch and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the covenants under their respective debt agreements  but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap 
one of arch s financial objectives is to increase its adjusted ebitda  as such earnings are a significant source of funds for servicing indebtedness and for investment in continued growth  including purchase of pagers and paging system equipment  construction and expansion of paging systems  and possible acquisitions 
adjusted ebitda  as determined by arch  may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled data of other paging companies 
amounts reflected as adjusted ebitda are not necessarily available for discretionary use as a result of restrictions imposed by the terms of existing or future indebtedness including the repayment of such indebtedness or the payment of interest thereon  limitations imposed by applicable law upon the payment of dividends or distributions or capital expenditure requirements 
tower site sale in april  arch announced an agreement for the tower site sale pursuant to which arch is selling certain tower site assets of aci for approximately million in cash subject to adjustment 
in the tower site sale  aci is selling communications towers  real estate  site management contracts and or leasehold interests involving sites in states and will rent space on the towers on which it currently operates communications equipment to service its own paging network 
aci used the net proceeds from the tower site sale to repay indebtedness 
aci held the initial closing of the tower site sale on june  with gross proceeds to aci of approximately million excluding million which was paid to entities affiliated with benbow for certain assets owned by such entities and sold as part of this transaction and held a second closing on september  with gross proceeds to aci of million 
the company has completed the sale of substantially all of the tower sites 
divisional reorganization in june  the arch board approved the divisional reorganization 
as part of the divisional reorganization  which is being implemented over a period of to months  arch has consolidated its former midwest  western  and northern divisions into four existing operating divisions  and is in the process of consolidating certain regional administrative support functions  such as customer service  collections  inventory and billing  to reduce redundancy and take advantage of various operating efficiencies 
arch estimates that the divisional reorganization  once fully implemented  will result in annual cost savings of approximately million 
these cost savings will consist primarily of a reduction in compensation expense of approximately million  a reduction in rental expense of facilities and general and administrative costs of approximately million 
arch expects to reinvest a portion of these cost savings to expand its sales activities  however to date the extent of this reinvestment and therefore the cost has not yet been determined 
in connection with the divisional reorganization  arch i anticipates a net reduction of approximately of its workforce  ii is closing certain office locations and redeploying other real estate assets and iii recorded a restructuring charge of million during the restructuring charge consisted of approximately i million for employee severance  ii million for lease obligations and terminations  and iii million of other costs 
the severance costs and lease obligations will require cash outlays throughout the to month restructuring period 
arch s management anticipates the cash requirements for these items to be relatively consistent from quarter to quarter throughout the divisional reorganization period 
these cash outlays will be funded from operations or the company s credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the desired cost savings will be achieved or that the anticipated reorganization of arch s business will be accomplished smoothly  expeditiously or successfully 
see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
subsidiary restructuring on june   arch effected a number of restructuring transactions involving certain of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries 
arch communications enterprises  inc ace was merged the ace usam merger into api  which was then a subsidiary of usa mobile communications  inc ii usam 
in connection with the ace usam merger  usam changed its name to aci and issued shares of its common stock to arch 
immediately prior to and in connection with the ace usam merger  i usam contributed its operating assets and liabilities to an existing subsidiary of usam  ii the westlink company  which held ace s equity interest in benbow  distributed its benbow assets and liabilities to a new subsidiary of ace  the westlink company ii  iii ace contributed its operating assets and liabilities to an existing subsidiary of ace  iv all of usam s subsidiaries were merged into api  and v the westlink company ii was merged into a new api subsidiary  benbow investments  inc benbow investments 
in december  arch effected a further restructuring involving certain of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries the december subsidiary restructuring 
in connection with the december subsidiary restructuring  i the beeper company of america  inc a colorado corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of api was converted in to arch llc  and ii all of api s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries  other than arch connecticut valley  inc and benbow investments were directly or indirectly merged into arch llc 
pending mobilemedia merger on august   the company entered into the mobilemedia merger agreement providing for the mobilemedia merger 
the mobilemedia merger is part of mobilemedia s reorganization plan 
arch s stockholders approved the mobilemedia merger on january  on february   the fcc released an order approving the transfer of mobilemedia s fcc licenses to arch in connection with the mobilemedia merger  subject to approval and confirmation of the reorganization plan 
the order granting the transfer became a final order  no longer subject to reconsideration or judicial review  on march  consummation of the mobilemedia transactions is subject to the confirmation of the reorganization plan by the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware  the occurrence or waiver of the conditions to the consummation of the reorganization plan  performance by third parties of their contractual obligations  the availability of sufficient financing and other conditions 
there can be no assurance the mobilemedia merger will be consummated 
pursuant to the mobilemedia merger  arch will i issue certain stock and warrants  ii pay million in cash to certain creditors of mobilemedia  iii pay approximately million of administrative expenses  amounts to be outstanding at the effective time under the dip credit agreement and transactional and related costs  iv raise million in cash through the rights offering  and v cause aci and api to borrow a total of approximately million 
after consummation of the mobilemedia transactions  which is expected to occur during the second quarter of  mobilemedia will become a wholly owned subsidiary of api

arch expects revenue to continue to be adversely affected in the first quarter of due to its fourth quarter decision not to replace normal attrition among direct sales personnel and the reduced effectiveness of certain reseller channels of distribution 
service  rental and maintenance revenues  which consist primarily of recurring revenues associated with the sale or lease of pagers  increased to million a increase in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these increases in revenues were due primarily to the increase  through internal growth  in the number of units in service from million at december  to million at december  maintenance revenues represented less than of total service  rental and maintenance revenues in the years ended december  and arch does not differentiate between service and rental revenues 
product sales  less cost of products sold  decreased to million a decrease in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   respectively  as a result of a decline in the average revenue per pager sold 
service  rental and maintenance expenses  which consist primarily of telephone line and site rental expenses  increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenses associated with system expansions and an increase in the number of units in service 
as existing paging systems become more populated through the addition of new subscribers  the fixed costs of operating these paging systems are spread over a greater subscriber base 
annualized service  rental and maintenance expenses per subscriber were in the year ended december  compared to in the corresponding period 
selling expenses decreased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of net new subscriber additions and nonrecurring marketing costs incurred in to promote arch s new arch paging brand identity 
the number of net new subscriber additions resulting from internal growth decreased by in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a general slowing of industry growth  compared to prior years  net new subscriber additions were also adversely affected in the fourth quarter of by arch s conscious decision  in anticipation of the mobilemedia merger  not to replace normal attrition among direct sales personnel and by the reduced effectiveness of certain reseller channels 
arch expects its selling expenses to increase in due to increased hiring of direct sales personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december   from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to administrative and facility costs associated with supporting more units in service 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these expenses principally reflect arch s acquisitions of paging businesses in prior periods accounted for as purchases  and investment in pagers and other system expansion equipment to support growth 
operating losses were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   as a result of the factors outlined above 
net interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase is principally attributable to an increase in arch s outstanding debt 
interest expense for the year ended december  and includes approximately million and million  respectively  of non cash interest accretion on the senior discount notes 
arch recognized an income tax benefit of million in the year ended december  this benefit represented the tax benefit of operating losses incurred subsequent to the acquisitions of usa mobile and westlink which were available to offset deferred tax liabilities arising from arch s acquisition of usa mobile in september and westlink in may the tax benefit of these operating losses was fully recognized during accordingly  arch has established a valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets which as of december  reduced the income tax benefit to zero 
arch does not expect to recover  in the foreseeable future  its deferred tax asset and will continue to increase its valuation reserve accordingly 
see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
in june  arch recognized an extraordinary charge of million representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of indebtedness under prior credit facilities 
net loss increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   as a result of the factors outlined above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  and net revenues increased million  or  from million to million over the same period 
service  rental and maintenance revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these increases in revenues were due primarily to the increase in the number of units in service from million at december  to million at december  and the full year impact of the westlink acquisition which was completed in may maintenance revenues represented less than of total service  rental and maintenance revenues in the years ended december  and product sales  less cost of products sold  increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of a greater number of pager unit sales 
service  rental and maintenance expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenses associated with system expansions and the provision of paging services to a greater number of subscribers 
annual service  rental and maintenance expenses per subscriber decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  selling expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase in selling expenses was due to the full year impact of the westlink acquisition and the marketing costs incurred to promote arch s arch paging brand identity 
arch s selling cost per net new pager in service increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december   primarily due to fixed selling costs and increased marketing costs being spread over fewer net new units put into service 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to increased expenses associated with supporting more units in service  including the full year impact of westlink  as well as expenses associated with the establishment of arch s national services division 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  these expenses reflect arch s acquisitions of paging businesses  accounted for as purchases  and continued investment in pagers and other system expansion equipment to support continued growth 
operating loss increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of the factors outlined above 
net interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in arch s average outstanding debt 
in and interest expense includes approximately million and million  respectively  of non cash interest accretion on arch s senior discount notes due under which semi annual interest payments commence on september  see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  arch recognized income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  representing the tax benefit of operating losses subsequent to the acquisitions of usa mobile in september and westlink in may which were available to offset deferred tax liabilities arising from arch s acquisitions of usa mobile and westlink 
during  arch recognized an extraordinary charge of million  representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of indebtedness under a prior credit facility 
net loss increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of the factors outlined above 
included in the net loss for the years ended december  and were charges of million and million  respectively  representing arch s pro rata share of benbow s losses since the westlink acquisition in may liquidity and capital resources arch s business strategy requires the availability of substantial funds to finance the expansion of existing operations  to fund capital expenditures for pagers and paging system equipment  to service debt and to finance acquisitions 
capital expenditures and commitments excluding acquisitions of paging businesses  arch s capital expenditures were million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  to date  arch has funded its capital expenditures with net cash provided by operating activities and the incurrence of debt 
arch s capital expenditures for the year ending december  were primarily for the purchase of pagers  paging system equipment and transmission equipment  information systems  advances to benbow as described below and capitalized financing costs 
arch believes that it will have sufficient cash available from operations and credit facilities to fund anticipated expenditures for the year ended december  arch is obligated  to the extent such funds are not available to benbow from other sources and subject to the approval of arch s designee on benbow s board of directors  to advance to benbow sufficient funds to service its fcc license related debt obligations incurred by benbow in connection with its acquisition of its n pcs licenses and to finance construction of an n pcs system 
the total cost to benbow of servicing its debt obligations and constructing an n pcs system including the effect of benbow s acquisition of page call will be approximately million over the next five years 
see business investments in narrowband pcs licenses 
other commitments and contingencies interest payments on the million principal amount at maturity of arch s senior discount notes due the senior discount notes commence september  arch expects to service such interest payments out of cash made available to it by its subsidiaries 
based on the principal amount of senior discount notes presently outstanding  such interest payments will equal million on march and september of each year until scheduled maturity on march  a default by arch in its payment obligations under the senior discount notes could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects of arch

sources of funds arch s net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
arch believes that its capital needs for the foreseeable future will be funded with borrowings under current and future credit facilities  net cash provided by operations and  depending on arch s needs and market conditions  possible sales of equity or debt securities 
for additional information  see note of notes to arch s consolidated financial statements 
arch s ability to access future borrowings will be dependent  in part  on its ability to continue to grow its adjusted ebitda 
issuance and sale of notes on june   arch through its wholly owned subsidiary aci  issued and sold million principal amount of senior notes due the notes for net proceeds of million after deducting the discount to the initial purchasers and offering expenses paid by aci 
the notes were sold at an initial price to investors of 
the notes mature on july  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  commencing january  see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
equity investment on june   two partnerships managed by sandler capital management company  inc  an investment management firm sandler  together with certain other private investors  made an equity investment in arch of million in the form of series c convertible preferred stock of arch series c preferred stock 
arch used million of the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under ace s existing credit facility as part of the establishment of the amended credit facility 
the series c preferred stock i is convertible into common stock of arch at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments  ii bears dividends at an annual rate of  a payable quarterly in cash or  at arch s option  through the issuance of shares of arch s common stock valued at of the then prevailing market price or b if not paid quarterly  accumulating and payable upon redemption or conversion of the series c preferred stock or liquidation of arch  iii permits the holders after seven years to require arch  at arch s option  to redeem the series c preferred stock for cash or convert such shares into arch s common stock valued at of the then prevailing market price of arch s common stock  iv is subject to redemption for cash or conversion into arch s common stock at arch s option in certain circumstances  v in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture governing arch s senior discount notes due the senior discount notes indenture  requires arch  at its option  to redeem the series c preferred stock for cash or convert such shares into arch s common stock valued at of the then prevailing market price of arch s common stock  with such cash redemption or conversion being at a price equal to of the sum of the original purchase price plus accumulated dividends  vi limits certain mergers or asset sales by arch  vii so long as at least of the series c preferred stock remains outstanding  limits the incurrence of indebtedness and restricted payments in the same manner as contained in the senior discount notes indenture  and viii has certain voting and preemptive rights 
upon an event of redemption or conversion  arch  at this time  intends to convert the series c preferred stock into arch common stock 
api credit facility on november   the lenders to api approved an increase in api s existing credit facility from million to million  subject to completing the mobilemedia merger and certain other conditions 
the increase of million the api credit facility increase was to fund a portion of the cash necessary for arch to complete the mobilemedia merger 
the api credit facility increase was to be provided by four of api s existing lenders  provided the mobilemedia transactions were completed prior to march  in december and january  mobilemedia s general unsecured creditors class creditors voted to accept the reorganization plan 
in february  the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware ordered that certain supplemental disclosure be provided to the class creditors and that mobilemedia resolicit votes from that class on the reorganization plan  set march  as the deadline for re voting by mobilemedia s class creditors on the reorganization plan and for filing objections to the reorganization plan  and scheduled the confirmations hearing on the reorganization plan to resume on march  as a result of the resolicitation of votes of the holders of class creditors  it is not possible to consummate the mobilemedia merger by march  the four api lenders that were to fund the api credit facility increase have indicated their willingness to seek approval to extend million of the api credit facility increase through june   subject to formal approval  definitive documentation and negotiation of certain terms 
see business pending mobilemedia merger and note of notes to arch s consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on arch s operations to date 
paging systems equipment and operating costs have not increased in price and arch s pager costs have declined substantially in recent years 
this reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower pager prices charged to subscribers who purchase their pagers 
arch s general operating expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
factors affecting future operating results growth and acquisition strategy arch believes that the paging industry has experienced  and will continue to experience  consolidation due to factors that favor larger  multi market paging companies  including i the ability to obtain additional radio spectrum  ii greater access to capital markets and lower costs of capital  iii broader geographic coverage of paging systems  iv economies of scale in the purchase of capital equipment  v operating efficiencies and vi enhanced access to executive personnel 
arch has pursued  and intends to continue to pursue  acquisitions of paging businesses as a key component of its growth strategy 
however  the process of integrating acquired paging businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of arch s management 
no assurance can be given that suitable acquisitions can be identified  financed and completed on acceptable terms  or that any future acquisitions by arch will be successful 
see business paging operations 
implementation of arch s growth strategy will be subject to numerous other contingencies beyond the control of its management 
these contingencies include national and regional economic conditions  interest rates  competition  changes in regulation or technology and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that arch s growth strategy will prove effective or that its goals will be achieved 
see business business strategy and competition 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding arch s business strategy requires the availability of substantial funds to finance the continued development and future growth and expansion of its operations  including possible acquisitions 
the amount of capital required by arch following the mobilemedia merger will depend upon a number of factors  including subscriber growth  the type of paging devices and services demanded by customers  service revenues  technological developments  marketing and sales expenses  competitive conditions  the nature and timing of arch s n pcs strategy and acquisition strategies and opportunities 
no assurance can be given that additional equity or debt financing will be available to arch when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of sufficient financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on arch 
competition and technological change arch faces competition from other paging service providers in all markets in which it operates  as well as from certain competitors who hold nationwide licenses 
monthly fees for basic paging services have  in general  declined in recent years  due in part to competitive conditions  and arch may face significant price based competition in the future which could have a material adverse effect on arch 
certain competitors of arch possess greater financial  technical and other resources than arch 
a trend towards increasing consolidation in the paging industry in particular and the wireless communications industry in general in recent years has led to competition from increasingly larger and better capitalized competitors 
if any of such competitors were to devote additional resources to the paging business or focus on arch s particular markets  there could be a material adverse effect on arch 
competitors are currently using and developing a variety of two way paging technologies 
arch does not presently provide such two way services  other than as a reseller 
although such services generally are higher priced than traditional one way paging services  technological improvements could result in increased capacity and efficiency for such two way paging technologies and  accordingly  could result in increased competition for arch 
future technological advances in the telecommunications industry could increase new services or products competitive with the paging services provided by arch or could require arch to reduce the price of their paging services or incur additional capital expenditures to meet competitive requirements 
recent and proposed regulatory changes by the fcc are aimed at encouraging such technological advances and new services 
other forms of wireless two way communications technology  including cellular and broadband personal communications services pcs  and specialized mobile radio services  also compete with the paging services that arch currently provides 
while such services are primarily focused on two way voice communications  service providers are  in many cases  electing to provide paging services as an adjunct to their primary services 
technological change also may affect the value of the pagers owned by arch and leased to its subscribers 
if arch s subscribers request more technologically advanced pagers  including  but not limited to  two way pagers  arch could incur additional inventory costs and capital expenditures if required to replace pagers leased to its subscribers within a short period of time 
such additional investment or capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on arch 
there can be no assurance that arch will be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors in the paging business or with competitors offering alternative communication technologies 
pursuant to the calea  all telecommunications carriers  including arch  are subject to certain law enforcement assistance capability requirements 
these capability requirements will likely necessitate equipment modifications 
although calea requires the federal government to reimburse carriers for certain equipment modifications  it is unclear whether arch will be entitled to such a reimbursement and if so  how much arch will receive 
see business paging industry overview and competition 
government regulation  foreign ownership and possible redemption the paging operations of arch are subject to regulation by the fcc and various state regulatory agencies 
the fcc paging licenses granted to arch are for varying terms of up to years  at the end of which renewal applications must be approved by the fcc 
in the past  paging license renewal applications generally have been granted by the fcc upon a showing of compliance with fcc regulations and of adequate service to the public 
arch is unaware of any circumstances which would prevent the grant of any pending or future renewal applications  however  no assurance can be given that any of arch s renewal applications will be free of challenge or will be granted by the fcc 
it is possible that there may be competition for radio spectrum associated with licenses as they expire  thereby increasing the chances of third party interventions in the renewal proceedings 
other than those renewal applications still pending  the fcc has thus far granted each license renewal application that arch has filed 
there can be no assurance that the fcc and various state regulatory agencies will not propose or adopt regulations or take actions that would have a material adverse effect on arch 
the fcc s review and revision of rules affecting paging companies is ongoing and the regulatory requirements to which arch is subject may change significantly over time 
for example  the fcc has decided to adopt a market area licensing scheme for all paging channels under which carriers would be licensed to operate on a particular channel throughout a broad geographic area for example  a major trading area as defined by rand mcnally rather than being licensed on a site by site basis 
these geographic area licenses will be awarded pursuant to auction 
incumbent paging licensees that do not acquire licenses at auction will be entitled to interference protection from the market area licensee 
arch is participating actively in this proceeding in order to protect its existing operations and retain flexibility  on an interim and long term basis  to modify systems as necessary to meet subscriber demands 
the fcc has issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking in which the fcc sought comments on  among other matters  whether it should impose coverage requirements on licensees with nationwide exclusivity such as arch  whether these coverage requirements should be imposed on a nationwide or regional basis  and whether if such requirements are imposed failure to meet the requirements should result in a revocation of the entire nationwide license or merely a portion of the license 
if the fcc were to impose stringent coverage requirements on licensees with nationwide exclusivity  arch might have to accelerate the build out of its systems in certain areas 
changes in regulation of arch s paging businesses or the allocation of radio spectrum for services that compete with arch s business could adversely affect its results of operations 
in addition  some aspects of the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act may place additional burdens upon arch or subject arch to increased competition 
for example  the fcc has adopted rules that govern compensation to be paid to pay phone providers which has resulted in increased costs for certain paging services including toll free number paging 
arch has generally passed these costs on to its subscribers  which makes arch s services more expensive and which could affect the attraction or retention of customers  however  there can be no assurance that arch will be able to continue to pass on these costs 
in addition  the fcc also has adopted rules regarding payments by telecommunications companies into a revamped fund that will provide for the widespread availability of telecommunications services  including to low income consumers universal service 
prior to the implementation of the telecommunications act  universal service obligations largely were met by local telephone companies  supplemented by long distance telephone companies 
under the new rules  certain telecommunications carriers  including arch  are required to contribute to a revised fund created for universal service the universal service fund 
in addition  certain state regulatory authorities have enacted  or have indicated that they intend to enact  similar contribution requirements based on state revenues 
arch can not yet know the full impact of these state contribution requirements 
moreover  arch is not able at this time to estimate the amount of any such payments that it will be able to bill to their subscribers  however  payments into the universal service fund will likely increase the cost of doing business 
moreover  in a rulemaking proceeding pertaining to interconnection between lecs and cmrs providers such as arch  the fcc has concluded that lecs are required to compensate cmrs providers for the reasonable costs incurred by such providers in terminating traffic that originates on lec facilities  and vice versa 
consistent with this ruling  the fcc has determined that lecs may not charge a cmrs provider or other carrier for terminating lec originated traffic or for dedicated facilities used to deliver lec originated traffic to one way paging networks 
nor may lecs charge cmrs providers for number activation and use fees 
these interconnection issues are still in dispute  and it is unclear whether the fcc will maintain its current position 
depending on further fcc disposition of these issues  arch may or may not be successful in securing refunds  future relief or both  with respect to charges for termination of lec originated local traffic 
if these issues are ultimately resolved by the fcc in favor of cmrs providers  then arch will pursue relief through settlement negotiations  administrative complaint procedures or both 
if these issues are ultimately decided in favor of the lecs  arch likely would be required to pay all past due contested charges and may also be assessed interest and late charges for the withheld amounts 
although these requirements have not to date had a material adverse effect on arch  these or similar requirements could in the future have a material adverse effect on arch 
see industry overview regulation 
the communications act also limits foreign investment in and ownership of entities that are licensed as radio common carriers by the fcc 
arch owns or controls several radio common carriers and is accordingly subject to these foreign investment restrictions 
because arch is a parent of radio common carriers but is not a radio common carrier itself  arch may not have more than of its stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  a foreign government or its representatives or a foreign corporation if the fcc finds that the public interest would be served by denying such ownership 
in connection with the wto agreement agreed to by countries the fcc adopted rules effective february  that create a very strong presumption in favor of permitting a foreign interest in excess of if the foreign investor s home market country signed the wto agreement 
arch s subsidiaries that are radio common carrier licensees are subject to more stringent requirements and may have only up to of their stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  a foreign government or their representatives or a foreign corporation 
this ownership restriction is not subject to waiver 
see business regulation 
arch s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended permits the redemption of shares of arch s capital stock from foreign stockholders where necessary to protect fcc licenses held by arch or its subsidiaries  but such redemption would be subject to the availability of capital to arch and any restrictions contained in applicable debt instruments and under the dgcl which currently would not permit any such redemptions 
the failure to redeem such shares promptly could jeopardize the fcc licenses held by arch or its subsidiaries 
subscriber turnover the results of operations of wireless messaging service providers  such as arch  can be significantly affected by subscriber cancellations 
the sales and marketing costs associated with attracting new subscribers are substantial relative to the costs of providing service to existing customers 
because the paging business is characterized by high fixed costs  cancellations directly and adversely affect ebitda 
an increase in the subscriber cancellation rate could have a material adverse effect on arch 
dependence on third parties arch does not manufacture any of the pagers used in its paging operations 
arch buys pagers primarily from motorola  nec and panasonic communications systems company and therefore is dependent on such manufacturers to obtain sufficient pager inventory for new subscriber and replacement needs 
in addition  arch purchases terminals and transmitters primarily from glenayre and motorola and thus is dependent on such manufacturers for sufficient terminals and transmitters to meet their expansion and replacement requirements 
to date  arch has not experienced significant delays in obtaining pagers  terminals or transmitters  but there can be no assurance that arch will not experience such delays in the future 
arch s purchase agreement with motorola expires on june   although it contains a provision for renewals for one year terms 
there can be no assurance that arch s agreement with motorola will be renewed or  if renewed  that such agreement will be on terms and conditions as favorable to arch as those under the current agreements 
although arch believes that sufficient alternative sources of pagers  terminals and transmitters exist  there can be no assurance that arch would not be materially adversely affected if it were unable to obtain these items from current supply sources or on terms comparable to existing terms 
see business sources of equipment 
finally  arch relies on third parties to provide satellite transmission for some aspects of their paging services 
to the extent there are satellite outages or if satellite coverage is otherwise impaired  arch may experience a loss of service until such time as satellite coverage is restored  which could have a material adverse effect on arch 
possible acquisition transactions arch believes that the paging industry will undergo further consolidation  and arch expects to participate in such continued industry consolidation 
arch has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions or other business combinations 
the process of integrating acquired paging businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of arch s management and financial and other resources 
no assurance can be given that suitable acquisition transactions can be identified  financed and completed on acceptable terms  that arch s future acquisitions will be successful  or that arch will participate in any future consolidation of the paging industry 
dependence on key personnel the success of arch will depend  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
arch does not have employment agreements with  or maintain life insurance on the lives of  any of its current executive officers  although certain executive officers have entered into non competition agreements and all executive officers have entered into executive retention agreements with arch 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of its executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on arch 
impact of the year issue the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of arch s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  the computerized systems including both information and non information technology systems and applications used by arch are being reviewed  evaluated and  if and where necessary  modified or replaced to ensure that all financial  information and operating systems are year compliant 
arch has created a cross functional project group the yk project group to work on the year problem 
the yk project group is finishing its analysis of external and internal areas likely to be affected by the year problem 
it has classified the identified areas of concern into either a mission critical or non mission critical status 
for the external areas  arch has distributed vendor surveys to its primary and secondary vendors 
the surveys requested information about hardware and or software supplied by information technology vendors as well as non information technology system vendors that might use embedded technologies in their systems or products 
information was requested regarding the vendor s year compliance planning  timing  status  testing and contingency planning 
as part of its evaluation of year vulnerability related to its pager and paging equipment vendors  arch has discussed with them their efforts to identify potential issues associated with their equipment and or software and has concluded that  to the extent any vulnerability exists  it has been addressed 
internally  arch is completing an inventory audit of hardware and software testing for both its corporate and divisional operations 
these areas of operation include information systems  finance  operations  inventory  billing  pager activation and purchasing 
additional testing is scheduled to conclude in the second quarter of arch expects that it will incur costs to replace existing hardware  software and paging equipment  which will be capitalized and amortized in accordance with arch s existing accounting policies  while maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred 
arch has upgraded hardware to enable compliance testing to be performed on dedicated test equipment in an isolated production like environment 
based on arch s costs incurred to date  as well as estimated costs to be incurred over the next nine months  arch does not expect that resolution of the year problem will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
costs of the year project are based on current estimates and actual results may vary significantly from such estimates once detailed plans are developed and implemented 
while it is arch s stated goal to be compliant  on an internal basis  by september   arch may face the possibility that one or more of its mission critical vendors  such as its utility providers  telephone carriers or satellite carriers  may not be year compliant 
because of the unique nature of such vendors  alternative providers of these services may not be available 
additionally  although arch has initiated its test plan for its business related hardware and software applications  there can be no assurance that such testing will detect all applications that may be affected by the year problem 
lastly  arch does not manufacture any of the pagers or paging related equipment used by its customers or for its own paging operations 
although arch is in the process of testing of such equipment it has relied to a large extent on the representations and assessments of its vendors with respect to their readiness 
arch can offer no assurances as to the accuracy of such vendors representations and assessments 
arch has initiated the process of designing and implementing contingency plans relating to the year problem 
to this end  each department will identify the likely risks and determine commercially reasonable solutions 
the yk project group will collect and review the determinations on both a department by department and company wide basis 
arch intends to complete its year contingency planning during calendar year no dividends arch has never declared or paid cash dividends 
arch does not intend  to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
certain covenants in the api credit facility and in other arch debt instruments  effectively prohibit the declaration or payment of cash dividends by arch for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of the series c preferred stock generally prohibit the payment of cash dividends on common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the series c preferred stock are paid in full

history of losses since its inception  arch has not reported any net income 
arch reported net losses of million  million  million in the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
these historical net losses have resulted principally from substantial depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to intangible assets and pager depreciation  interest expense and other costs of growth 
substantial and increased amounts of debt are expected to be outstanding for the foreseeable future  which will result in significant additional interest expense which could have a material adverse effect on arch 
arch expects to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future  whether or not the mobilemedia merger is consummated

volatility of trading price the market price of common stock is subject to significant fluctuation and has recently declined 
between november  and january   the reported sale price of common stock on the nasdaq national market has ranged from a low of 
per share in october to a high of per share in november 
the trading price of common stock following the mobilemedia merger will likely be affected by numerous factors  including the risk factors set forth herein  as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
during recent periods  share prices of paging companies such as arch have exhibited a high degree of volatility 
shortfalls in revenues or ebitda from the levels anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of arch s common stock in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond arch s immediate control and can be unpredictable 
the trading price of arch s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in the paging industry generally  which may not have any direct relationship with arch s business or long term prospects 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
indebtedness and high degree of leverage arch is highly leveraged 
at december   arch and its subsidiaries had outstanding billion of total debt  including i million principal amount of aci s senior notes due the aci notes  ii million principal amount of aci s senior notes due the aci notes  iii million accreted value of aci s senior notes due the aci notes and  together with the aci notes and the aci notes  the aci notes  iv million accreted value of the senior discount notes  v million principal amount of arch s convertible subordinated debentures due the arch convertible debentures and vi million of borrowings under the api credit facility 
arch s high degree of leverage may have adverse consequences for arch  including i the ability of arch to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes  may be impaired or extinguished or such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  ii a substantial portion of the adjusted ebitda will be required to pay interest expense  which will reduce the funds which would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  iii the api credit facility and the indentures the arch indentures under which the aci notes are outstanding contain financial and restrictive covenants  the failure to comply with which may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on arch  iv arch may be more highly leveraged than its competitors which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  v arch s high degree of leverage will make it more vulnerable to a downturn in its business or the economy generally  and vi arch s high degree of leverage may impair its ability to participate in the future consolidation of the paging industry 
arch has implemented various initiatives to reduce capital costs while sustaining acceptable levels of unit and revenue growth 
as a result  arch s rate of internal growth in units in service has slowed and is expected to remain below the rates of internal growth previously achieved by arch  but arch has not yet reduced its financial leverage significantly 
there can be no assurance that arch will be able to reduce its financial leverage significantly or that arch will achieve an appropriate balance between growth which it considers acceptable and future reductions in financial leverage 
if arch is not able to achieve continued growth in ebitda  it may be precluded from incurring additional indebtedness due to cash flow coverage requirements under existing debt instruments 
ebitda is not a measure defined in gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled data of other paging companies

mobilemedia merger cash requirements to fund the estimated cash payments required by the mobilemedia merger of approximately million consisting of million to fund a portion of the cash payments to mobilemedia s secured creditors and million to fund estimated administrative expenses  amounts to be outstanding at the effective time under the dip credit agreement and transaction expenses  api and the bank of new york  toronto dominion texas  inc  royal bank of canada and barclays bank  plc have executed a commitment letter for a million increase to the api credit facility the api credit facility increase 
the api credit facility increase was approved on november  by all api lenders  provided the mobilemedia transactions were completed prior to march  as a result of the resolicitation of votes of the holders of class creditors  it is not possible to consummate the mobilemedia merger by march  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources api credit facility 
the four api lenders that were to fund the api credit facility increase have indicated their willingness to seek approval to extend million of the api credit facility increase through june   subject to formal approval  definitive documentation and negotiation of certain terms 
in addition  aci intends to issue million of new senior notes the planned aci notes 
there can be no assurance that arch will complete an offering of the planned aci notes on terms satisfactory to it  if at all 
as a result  aci and the bear stearns companies  inc  td securities usa  inc  the bank of new york and royal bank of canada have executed a commitment letter for a million bridge facility the bridge facility which would be available to arch in the absence of an offering of the planned aci notes 
the bridge facility was scheduled to expire on february  but aci elected to extend it to june  the planned aci notes  the bridge facility and the mobilemedia merger each require approval by the required lenders as defined in the api credit facility  and there can be no assurance such approval will be granted 
if api s lenders do not grant the foregoing approvals  and arch is not able to arrange alternative financing to make the cash payments required by the mobilemedia merger and therefore could not consummate the mobilemedia merger  and arch s failure to perform its obligations under the mobilemedia merger agreement is not otherwise excused  arch will be liable to pay the mobilemedia breakup fee of million to mobilemedia 
api credit facility  bridge facility and indenture restrictions the api credit facility  the bridge facility and the arch indentures impose or will impose certain operating and financial restrictions on arch 
the api credit facility requires api and  in certain cases  aci  to maintain specified financial ratios  among other obligations  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  each as defined in the api credit facility 
in addition  the api credit facility limits or restricts  among other things  api s ability to i declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  ii prepay  redeem or purchase debt  iii incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions  iv make loans and investments  v incur indebtedness and contingent obligations  vi amend or otherwise alter debt instruments and other material agreements  vii engage in mergers  consolidations  acquisitions and asset sales  viii engage in transactions with affiliates  and ix alter its lines of business or accounting methods 
in addition  the bridge facility and the arch indentures limit  among other things i the incurrence of additional indebtedness by arch and its restricted subsidiaries as defined therein  ii the payment of dividends and other restricted payments by arch and its restricted subsidiaries  iii asset sales  iv transactions with affiliates  v the incurrence of liens  and vi mergers and consolidations 
arch s ability to comply with such covenants may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic and financial conditions 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the api credit facility  the bridge facility and or the arch indentures 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the api credit facility  the bridge facility or the arch indentures  the creditors could elect to declare all amounts outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if arch were unable to repay any such amounts  the creditors could proceed against the collateral securing certain of such indebtedness 
if the lenders under the api credit facility accelerate the payment of such indebtedness  there can be no assurance that the assets of arch would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and the other indebtedness of arch  including the arch notes and any borrowings under the bridge facility 
in addition  because the api credit facility  the bridge facility and the arch indentures limit or will limit the ability of arch to engage in certain transactions except under certain circumstances  arch may be prohibited from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to arch including the mobilemedia merger  which is subject to the approval of the required lenders as defined under the api credit facility 
arch will be incurring additional indebtedness in connection with the mobilemedia merger and the reorganization 
possible fluctuations in revenues and operating results arch believes that future fluctuations in its revenues and operating results are possible as the result of many factors  including competition  subscriber turnover  new service developments and technological change 
arch s current and planned debt repayment levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term  and are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues  and arch may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
due to the foregoing or other factors  it is possible that due to future fluctuations  arch s revenue or operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which may have a material adverse effect on the price of arch s common stock

divisional reorganization in june  the arch board approved the divisional reorganization 
as part of such reorganization  which is expected to be implemented over a period of to months  arch has consolidated its former midwest  western and northern divisions into four existing operating divisions and is in the process of consolidating certain regional administrative support functions  such as customer service  collections  inventory and billing  to reduce redundancy and to take advantage of various operating efficiencies 
once fully implemented  the divisional reorganization is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million 
arch expects to reinvest a portion of these cost savings to expand its sales activities 
in connection with the divisional reorganization  arch i anticipates a net reduction of approximately of its workforce  ii plans to close certain office locations and redeploy other real estate assets and iii recorded a restructuring charge of million in the restructuring charge consisted of approximately i million for employee severance  ii million for lease obligations and terminations and iii million of other costs 
there can be no assurance that the expected cost savings will be achieved or that the reorganization of arch s business will be accomplished smoothly  expeditiously or successfully 
the difficulties of such reorganization may be increased by the need to integrate mobilemedia s operations in multiple locations and to combine two corporate cultures 
the inability to successfully integrate the operations of mobilemedia would have a material adverse effect on arch 
anti takeover provisions arch s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended and arch s by laws include provisions for a classified board of directors  the issuance of blank check preferred stock the terms of which may be fixed by the arch board without further stockholder approval  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent in lieu of a meeting and certain procedural requirements governing stockholder meetings 
arch also has a stockholders rights plan 
in addition  section of the dgcl will  with certain exceptions  prohibit arch from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder as defined therein for a three year period following the date that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
such provisions may have the effect of delaying  making more difficult or preventing a change in control or acquisition of arch 
recent and pending accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
arch adopted sfas no 
in the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on its reporting of income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas no 
also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
arch adopted sfas no 
for its year ended december  adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on its reporting 
in march  the accounting standards committee of the financial accounting standards board issued statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop establishes criteria for capitalizing costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
arch adopted sop in the adoption of sop has not had a material effect on arch s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the financial accounting standards board issued statement of position sop reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
arch adopted sop effective january  initial application of sop will be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material effect on arch s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings 
arch intends to adopt this standard effective january  arch has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements  however  adopting sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of the company s long term debt is subject to fixed rates of interest or interest rate protection 
in the event that the interest rate on the company s non fixed rate debt fluctuates by in either direction  the company believes the impact on its results of operations would be immaterial 
the company transacts infrequently in foreign currency and therefore is not exposed to significant foreign currency market risk
