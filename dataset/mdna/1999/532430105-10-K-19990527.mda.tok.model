the company believes this is the general pattern associated with the mail order and retail industries

the company believes that its cash flow from operations  current investment balance  and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating needs 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange the company is generally able to reflect cost increases and decreases resulting from the effects of inflation and foreign currency fluctuations in its selling prices 
in addition  most foreign purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by these factors 
year compliance program the company s year compliance program is directed primarily towards ensuring that the company will be able to continue to perform its critical functions process sales orders from  and ship merchandise to customers  order and receive merchandise from vendors  and process payments to vendors  employees and shareholders 
the company is in the process of modifying its internal computer software applications and systems to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company is utilizing both its in house staff as well as outside resources to modify its systems 
this work is expected to be completed by the end of the company s second fiscal quarter ending august  and is currently on schedule 
in addition to internal systems  the company has established procedures to determine that outside computer software vendors are either already year compliant or have timely dates when they intend to be compliant 
the company is also reviewing all computer hardware such as mid range  mainframe and personal computers  networks  telephone switches  voice mail systems  and time clocks  as well as its distribution and warehouse equipment  to ensure year compliance 
the company has also contacted its various merchandise vendors to inquire as to their year readiness  and is continuing to follow up with those vendors who have not responded to date 
costs the company presently anticipates that the cost of modifying its computer software applications and systems to be year compliant will be approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent to date 
these amounts are expected to be funded from operating cash flow 
risks the variety and complexity of the year issues identified and the proposed solutions  the company s dependence on the technical skills of employees and independent contractors  and especially the representations and readiness of third parties are among the factors that could cause the company s efforts to be less than fully effective 
in addition  year issues present a number of risks that are beyond the company s reasonable control  such as continued service from outside parties such as utility companies  financial institutions  and transportation and delivery companies such as the us postal service and united parcel service 
the company s peak selling season runs from september through mid december  therefore  disruption of its business at the beginning of calendar year would be less significant than if it happened during its peak season 
the company expects to have adequate inventory on hand to service its customers  and the company expects to be able to shift its customer delivery operations to alternative carriers  if necessary 
the company does not rely on any single supplier for a significant portion of its products  and many of its vendors do not rely on computerized manufacturing systems 
the company has computerized telephone systems which process customer phone orders  any interruption in service by major telephone carriers could have a detrimental impact on the company s ability to receive orders and service its customers 
an assessment of the readiness of year compliance of third party entities with which the company has relationships is ongoing 
the company has inquired  or is in the process of inquiring  of significant third party entities as to their readiness with respect to year compliance and to date has received indications that many of them are either compliant or in the process of remediation 
the company will continue to monitor these third party entities to determine the impact on the business of the company and the actions the company must take  if any  in the event of non compliance by any of these third parties 
based upon the company s initial assessment of compliance by third parties  there appears to be no material business risk posed by any such noncompliance and  therefore  the company has not developed a contingency plan 
although the company believes that its year compliance program is designed to appropriately identify and address those year issues that are subject to the company s reasonable control  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts in this regard will be fully effective or that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
