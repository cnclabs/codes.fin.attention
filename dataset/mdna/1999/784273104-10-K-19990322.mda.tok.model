consolidated net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  as compared to million in the increase of million in net interest income during was primarily a result of an increase in volume of million in earning assets which amounted to approximately million of net interest income and an increase of approximately in loan fees 
late in  the federal open market committee fomc decreased the interbank borrowing rate by basis points and the discount rate by basis points which resulted in a decrease in the bank s prime rate from to 
the bank s average prime was in  as compared to in in a declining rate environment  the company must generally increase its earning assets in order to maintain net interest income growth 
consolidated net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  as compared to million in the million increase in net interest income during was due primarily to an increase in the volume of earning assets 
the bank s net interest margin for was  as compared to in the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to the impact of the competitive market and the resulting pressure on loan interest rates and imputed financing cost of leases 
loan fees contributed of loan and lease portfolio interest during  in and in this increase in the proportion of loan fees to total loan and lease interest in was due mainly to the impact of the increased activity in real estate construction 
in prior years the declining ratio was primarily due to an increase in the competitive atmosphere relating to loan pricing  the overall level of interest rates and the higher proportion of sba loans included in the loan portfolio sba loans generally have had lower origination fees 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in the difference was due primarily to the increase in volume offset by the decrease in overall interest rate paid 
actual interest expense rates declined from to 
this compares to a decrease in the yields on earning assets from in to in interest expense in was million as compared to million in this was mainly due to the increase in volumes 
actual interest expense rates declined from in to in this compares to a decrease in the yields on earning assets from in to in during both periods  interest expense proportionately declined at a greater rate than interest income 
it is management s opinion that this occurred because of measures taken by the bank  which management believed to be the most efficient product pricing for deposit products 
a substantial portion of the bank s deposits an average of in  and in each of and are non interest bearing and therefore do not reprice when interest rates change 
see funding 
this is somewhat ameliorated by a significant amount of customer corporate account balances which are tied to earnings credits and utilized to offset bank service costs 
due to the nature of the company s lending markets  in which loans are generally tied to the prime rate  an increase in interest rates should positively affect the company s future earnings  while a decline in interest rates would have a negative impact 
in late  market interest rates declined significantly due to several factors most notable of which were the strengthening of the dollar  the asia crisis and the collective wisdom that inflation had receded 
should this market trend of declining interest rates continue during  management believes the bank could experience an additional increase in its cost of funds relative to the yields earned on its earning assets 
this would produce a decrease in the bank s net interest margin 
according to the management s reasonable estimate on the impact of the changes in interest rates  it is estimated that for each basis point decline in the prime rate  net interest income is negatively impacted by approximately the company s net interest margin for the periods presented is high relative to its peer group  mainly due to its high proportion of non interest bearing deposits and the impact of the bank s financial services division 
net interest income also reflects the impact of nonperforming loans 
the effect of nonaccrual loans on interest income for the years ended december  through was as follows negative impact of nonaccrual loans dollars in thousands for the years ended december  interest revenue which would have been recorded under original terms interest revenue actually realized negative impact on interest revenue this table does not reflect the cash basis interest received on several significant loan collections during  as such loans were not classified as nonaccrual as of the end of the year 
the impact of such was significant in approximately of interest income was recognized in on collection of certain loans classified nonaccrual  which resulted in a basis point impact on the net interest margin 
provision for possible loan and lease losses the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses and therefore the related provision reflects the company s judgment as to the inherent risks associated with the loan and factoring portfolios 
since estimates of the adequacy of the company s allowance for possible loan and lease losses are based on foreseeable risks  such judgments are subject to change based on changing circumstances 
based on management s current evaluation of such risks  as well as judgments of the company s regulators  additions of  and were made to the allowance for possible loan and lease losses in  and  respectively 
management s determinations of the provision in  and were based on the measurement of the possibility of future estimated loan and lease losses through various objective and subjective criteria and the impact of net chargeoffs

advertising and marketing costs increased due to effects of greater amounts expended on charitable donations  community support events and client entertainment 
client services paid by the bank also increased due to the significant increase in services provided for client purposes 
total other expenses increased approximately or in as compared to this was primarily due to the increase in salaries and benefits arising from staff growth related to the increased level of bank s business activity and an increase in the provision for incentive payments for exceeding predefined goals 
business promotion and advertising expenses declined due to costs of promotions incurred in and none in in addition  the bank s data processing costs declined due to the termination of payments for its previous data processing software 
during the bank acquired a new processing system for a total cost of approximately this cost will be amortized over a five year period commencing in november amortization of core deposit intangibles is based on a declining balance method  and as such  the amount charged to expense will decline each year 
costs relating to client services increased approximately during as compared to mainly due to the addition of significant clients utilizing services purchased by the bank 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in  in and in the lower effective tax rates in and were primarily due to the reduction in the amount and proportion of amortization of the nondeductible portion of intangibles to pretax income arising in connection with the purchase of bb and astra financial corp

the company s policy is to generally acquire a rated or better us  state and municipal securities 
the specific issues are monitored for changes in financial condition 
appropriate action would be taken if significant deterioration was noted 
the pre tax unrealized gain on investment securities held to maturity was as of december  as compared to as of december  the increase in unrealized gains resulted from the significant decrease in interest rates in decreases in interest rates have an inverse effect on the value of securities for which the interest rate is fixed 
the bank s weighted average maturity of the held to maturity investment portfolio as of december  was approximately years 
it is estimated that for each change in interest rates  the value of the company s securities held to maturity will change by approximately 
this volatility decreases as the average maturity shortens 
since it is the intention of management to hold these securities to maturity  the unrealized gains will be realized over the life of the securities as above market interest income is recognized 
mortgage backed securities mbs are considered to have increased risks associated with them because of the timing of principal repayments 
as interest rates decrease  the average maturity of mortgages underlying mbs tend to decline  as rates increase  maturities tend to lengthen

loan and lease portfolio the following table shows the company s consolidated loans and leases by type of loan or borrower and their percentage distribution loan and lease portfolio dollars in thousands december  commercial      leasing  real estate construction      real estate other      consumer      other      unearned fee income total loan and lease portfolio      commercial leasing real estate construction real estate other consumer other unearned fee income total loan and lease portfolio general the company s loan and lease portfolio consists primarily of short term  floating rate loans for business and real estate purposes 
at december   approximately of the loan and lease portfolio consisted of commercial loans including non real estate sba loans and factoring  was leasing  was real estate construction  and was in real estate other 
the bank s legal lending limit for any one borrower was approximately million at december the commercial loan portfolio primarily consists of loans to small to medium sized businesses with gross revenues up to million  as well as loans to local professional businesspersons 
sjnb s lending services include revolving credit loans  sba loans  term loans  accounts receivable financing  factoring  equipment financing and letters of credit 
the commercial loan portfolio includes approximately million of sba loans which are not made for real estate purposes 
these loans carry a to guarantee by the sba 
included in commercial loans as of december  were factored accounts receivable of approximately million or of total loans and leases 
as of december   factored accounts receivable were million or of total loans 
the bank purchases accounts receivable from clients and then receives payment directly from the party obligated for the receivable 
in most cases  the bank s financial services division purchases the receivables subject to recourse from the bank s factoring client 
the factoring business and related purchasing of accounts receivable is subject to a greater degree of risk than normal lending due to the involvement of the third party obligee  the lack of control over the direct receipt of payment  and the potential purchase of fraudulent or inflated receivables 
to date  there have been no significant losses relating to the bank s factoring program 
the real estate construction portfolio of the loan and lease portfolio consists of residential and commercial 
such loans are made on the basis of the economic viability for the specific project  the cash flow resources of the developer  the developer s equity in the project and the underlying financial strength of the borrower 
the company s policy is to monitor each loan with respect to incurred costs  sales price and sales cycle 
the real estate other loans include term loans up to a twenty five year maturity on income producing commercial properties 
these loans include sba real estate type loans 
consumer loans consist primarily of loans to individuals for personal uses  such as home equity loans  installment purchases  premier lines unsecured lines of credit and overdraft protection loans and a variety of other consumer purposes 
other loans include loans to real estate developers for short term investment purposes approximately million  loans for real estate investment purposes made to non developers approximately million and loans for other investments approximately million 
concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographic region  or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 
although the company has a diversified loan and lease portfolio  a substantial portion of its customers ability to honor loan and lease terms is reliant upon the economic stability of santa clara county  which in some degree relies on the stability of high technology companies in its silicon valley 
loans are made on the basis of a secure repayment source as the first priority 
collateral is generally a secondary source for loan qualification 
approximately of the loan and lease portfolio is directly related to real estate or real estate interests  when real estate construction loans  real estate other loans  prime equity loans included in consumer loans in the amount of million and certain other loans to real estate developers and other investors for short term investment purposes approximately of the loan and lease portfolio are included 
included in the real estate other category are approximately million of sba real estate type loans  of which  to are guaranteed by the sba 
approximately of the loan and lease portfolio is made up of commercial loans  however  no particular industry represents a significant portion of such loans 
inherent in any loan and lease portfolio are risks associated with certain types of loans and leases 
the company attempts to limit these risks through conservative loan and lease policies and review procedures that are applied at the time of origination 
included in these policies are specific maximum loan to value ltv limitations as to various categories of real estate related loans 
these ratios are as follows maximum loan to value ratios maximum ltv category of real estate collateral ratio raw land land development construction single family residence  less than greater than other term loans construction take out and commercial other improved property prime equity loans the company s loan and lease policy provides that any term loans on income producing properties must have a minimum debt service coverage of at least to for non owner occupied property and at least to for owner occupied 
one of the significant risks associated with real estate lending is the risk associated with the possible existence of environmental risks or hazards on or in property affiliated with the loan 
the bank attempts to mitigate such risk through the use of an environmental risk questionnaire for all loans secured by real estate 
a phase i environmental report is required if so indicated by response to the questionnaire or if for any other reason it is determined to be appropriate 
other reasons would include the industrial use of environmentally sensitive substances or the proximity to other known environmental problems 
a phase ii report is required in certain cases  depending on the outcome of the phase i report 
activity total loans and leases were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  total loans and leases were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  the increase in total loans and leases of million during relates primarily to the growth in the bank s real estate portfolio 
both construction lending and real estate term lending showed significant growth during the growth in the construction portfolio was mainly due to the rapid expansion of housing in the bank s market area 
demand in the housing market was fueled by low unemployment less than over the last two years and increased wealth of employees of silicon valley technology firms 
the bank was able to provide financing for several construction projects  and this  together with the low interest rate environment which fuels the refinancing market in which the bank participated  caused the real estate term loans to increase 
total loans were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  total loans were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  the increase in total loans of million during relates to the overall growth in the bank s loan portfolio 
the most significant areas of growth were the increase in commercial loans of million 
in addition  real estate construction increased million  while real estate other increased million  of which million was sba real estate loans 
the economic climate in northern california has been generally strong in and the competitive environment within the bank s marketplace for additional loan and lease growth has become more aggressive between lenders  resulting in increasingly competitive pricing 
to the extent that such competitive activity continues during and the bank finds it necessary to meet such competition  the bank s net interest margins could decline 
it is uncertain what impact the current economic crisis currently unfolding in asia and south america will have on the silicon valley and  potentially  the business of the bank 
asset quality allowance for possible loan and lease losses a consequence of lending activities is the potential for loss 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for possible loan and lease losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for possible loan and lease losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses and the level of the related provision for possible loan and lease losses is determined on a judgmental basis by management based on consideration of o economic conditions  o borrowers financial condition  o loan and lease impairment  o evaluation of industry trends  o industry and other concentrations  o loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management  o continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio  o monthly review and evaluation of problem loans and leases identified as having loss potential  o quarterly review by the board of directors  o off balance sheet risks  and o assessments by regulators and other third parties 
in addition to the internal assessment of the loan and lease portfolio and off balance sheet credit risk  such as letters of credit  etc  the company also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a quarterly basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
examinations of the loan and lease portfolio are also conducted periodically by the federal banking regulators 
the company utilizes a method of assigning a minimum and maximum loss ratio for each grade of loan or lease within each category of loans commercial  real estate other  real estate construction  etc 
loans and leases are graded on a ranking system based on management s assessment of the loan or lease s credit quality 
the assigned loss ratio is based upon the company s prior experience  industry experience  delinquency trends and the level of nonaccrual loans 
in addition  the company s methodology considers and assigns a risk factor for current economic conditions  off balance sheet risk and concentrations of credit 
the methodology provides a systematic approach for the measurement of the possible existence of future loan and lease losses 
management and the board of directors evaluate the allowance and determine its desired level considering objective and subjective measures  such as knowledge of the borrowers business  valuation of collateral  the determination of impaired loans and leases and exposure to potential losses 
based on known information available to it at the date of this report  management believes that the company s allowance for possible loan and lease losses  determined as described above  was adequate at december  for foreseeable losses 
the allowance for possible loan and lease losses is a general reserve available against the total loan and lease portfolio and off balance sheet credit exposure 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans or leases  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require the bank to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
finally  there is uncertainty concerning future economic trends 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provision for possible loan and lease losses in future periods

based on an evaluation of individual credits  historical credit loss experienced by loan or lease type and economic conditions  management has allocated the allowance for possible loan and lease losses as follows for the past five years allocation of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses dollars in thousands amount of allowance allocation at december  commercial      leasing real estate construction real estate other      consumer other unallocated total      percent of loans and leases in each category to total loans and leases at december  commercial leasing real estate construction real estate other consumer other total the allowance for possible loan and lease losses is maintained without any internal allocation to the segments of the loan and lease portfolio and the entire allowance is available to cover loan and lease losses 
the allocation is based on subjective estimates that take into account historical loss experience and management s current assessment of the relative risk characteristics of the portfolio as of the reporting date noted above and as described more fully herein 
nonperforming loans and leases loans for which the accrual of interest has been suspended  restructured loans and other loans with principal or interest contractually past due days or more are set forth in the following table nonperforming loans dollars in thousands december  loans accounted for on a non accrual basis  loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms other loans with principal or interest contractually past due days or more total  potential nonperforming loans and leases are identified by management as part of its ongoing evaluation and review of the loan and lease portfolio 
based on such reviews and information known to management at the date of this report  management has not identified any loans or leases other than those in the above table about which it has serious doubts regarding the borrowers ability to comply with present loan repayment terms  such that the loans or leases might subsequently be classified as nonperforming 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectibility of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
other real estate owned at december  and there were no properties owned by the bank acquired through the foreclosure process 
commitments and lines of credit it is the bank s policy not to issue formal commitments or lines of credit except to well established and financially responsible local commercial enterprises 
such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs 
occasionally  such commitments are in the form of a letter of credit to facilitate the customer s particular business transaction 
commitments and lines of credit typically mature within one year 
these commitments involve to varying degrees credit risk in excess of the amount recognized as either an asset or liability in the statement of financial position 
the company attempts to control this credit risk through its credit approval process 
the same credit policies are used when entering into such commitments 
as of december   the company had undisbursed loan commitments to extend credit as follows undisbursed loan commitments dollars in thousands loan category amount commercial  real estate construction  real estate other  consumer  other  total  in addition  there was approximately million available for commitments under unused letters of credit 
funding deposits represent sjnb s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area 
sjnb s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the following table summarizes the composition of deposits as of december   and deposit categories dollars in thousands december  december  december  percentage percentage percentage total of total total of total total of total amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits noninterest bearing demand    interest bearing demand    money market and savings    certificates of deposit less than    or more    total    deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  these increases are due to a combination of factors including the development of customers with significant cash balances  utilization of sophisticated cash management systems and aggressive pricing of interest rates 
see below for a description of a million synthetic floating rate certificate of deposit which is included in the deposit total for the bank has been able to attract a significant proportion of its deposits in the form of noninterest bearing deposits 
the bank s primary business is commercially oriented with significant noninterest bearing deposits maintained by commercial customers 
in a high interest rate environment  these funds could be subject to disintermediation moved for higher interest rate products 
to counter such possibilities  the bank maintains an array of products which it believes would be competitive if such were to occur 
in addition  in illiquid economic times possibly recessions these deposits could be subject to withdrawal pressures 
see capital and liquidity liquidity for a discussion of the bank s liquidity sources 
the bank also raises a substantial amount of funds through certificates of deposit of or greater  which were approximately of total deposits 
these deposits are usually at interest rates greater than other types of deposits and are more sensitive to interest rate changes 
historically  the bank s overall cost of funds has been less than that of its peer group 
however  as these certificates of deposit are usually more interest rate sensitive  their repricing in an increasing interest rate environment could increase the bank s cost of funds and negatively impact the bank s net interest margin 
see capital and liquidity 
on december  the bank obtained million through the placement of a ten year synthetic floating rate certificate of deposit 
the instrument consists of two linked transactions  a callable interest rate swap and callable fixed rate certificate of deposit 
under the swap agreement  the bank pays libor plus basis points and receives for a period of ten years 
the swap is callable after one year by a major us domestic bank 
simultaneously  the bank issued a callable fixed rate certificate of deposit 
the certificate of deposit does not have any early redemption clauses  other than by death of the holder 
effectively  the bank s rate of interest on the combined transaction is libor plus five basis points 
the bank utilizes short term borrowings in its balance sheet management 
the short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase are used for short term liquidity needs 
the average cost of the borrowings during was  the average amount outstanding was million and the maximum at any month end was million 
asset liability management the company defines interest rate sensitivity as the measurement of the mismatch in repricing characteristics of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments at a specified point in time 
this mismatch known as interest rate sensitivity gap represents the potential mismatch in the change in the rate of interest revenue accrual and interest expense that would result from a change in interest rates 
mismatches in interest rate repricing among assets and liabilities arise primarily from the interaction of various customer businesses ie  types of loans and leases versus the types of deposits maintained and from management s discretionary investment and funds gathering activities 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
however  due to its size and direct competition from the major banks  the company must offer products which are competitive in the market place  even if less than optimum with respect to its interest rate exposure 
the company s balance sheet position at december  was asset sensitive  based upon the significant amount of variable rate loans and the repricing characteristics of its deposit accounts 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of interest rate decreases 
net interest revenues are negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates 
the interest rate gap is a measure of interest rate exposure and is based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and assumed repricing dates of others

the following table quantifies the company s interest rate exposure at december  based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and the assumed repricing dates of others

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to reprice  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
further  certain earning assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
the company considers the anticipated effects of these various factors in implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
a large proportion of the bank s deposits are non interest bearing demand deposits and are not included in the above table as they tend not to be interest rate sensitive 
the average balance of these deposits was million in in addition  the bank s total tangible capital of approximately million is not included as a funding source in the above table 
to counter its asset sensitive interest rate position  the bank has entered into interest rate floors as follows interest rate floors at december  notional amount   floor rate remaining life months carrying amount   fair market value  expiration date may  december  the bank has paid a fixed premium for which it will receive the amount of interest based on the notional amount and the difference between the floor rate and the current prime when prime is less than the floor rate 
this will protect the bank against decreases in its net income when prime decreases 
settlement is done quarterly  and the bank records the impact of this hedge on an accrual basis

liquidity management strives to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to meet customer requirements for loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
sjnb s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the bank utilizes brokered deposits on a limited basis to satisfy temporary liquidity needs 
the bank s sources of liquidity consist of its deposits with other banks  overnight funds sold to correspondent banks and short term  marketable investments net of short term borrowings 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of consolidated total assets  as compared to million or of consolidated total assets on december  in addition to the liquid asset portfolio  sjnb also has million in informal lines of credit available with three major commercial banks  approximately million of credit available at the federal reserve discount window and million in sba guaranteed loans which are available for sale and could likely be sold within a day period 
sjnb is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
in their normal course of business  commercial clients maintain balances in large certificates of deposit 
the stability of these balances hinges upon  among other factors  market conditions and each business seasonality 
large certificates of deposit amounted to of total deposits on december   as compared to for this increase was due to the million callable variable rate certificate discussed above and several significant deposits by existing customers 
liquidity is also affected by investment securities and loan and lease maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
the loan and lease portfolio consists primarily of floating rate  short term loans 
on december   approximately of total consolidated assets had maturities under one year and of total consolidated loans and leases had floating rates tied to the prime rate or similar indexes 
the short term nature of the loan and lease portfolio  and loan agreements which generally require monthly interest payments  provide the company with an additional secondary source of liquidity 
the company s liquidity is maintained by cash flows stemming from dividends and management fees from the bank and the exercise of stock options issued to the bank s employees and directors 
the amount of dividends from the bank is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere within this report 
subject to said restrictions  at december   up to million could have been paid to the parent company by the bank without regulatory approval 
the company s parent only financial statements are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dividends of million and million were paid to the parent company during and  respectively 
there are no material commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
effects of inflation the most direct effect of inflation on the company is higher interest rates 
because a significant portion of the bank s deposits are represented by non interest bearing demand accounts  changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the financial results of the bank 
see asset liability management 
another effect of inflation is the upward pressure on the company s operating expenses 
inflation did not have a material effect on the bank s operations in  or item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company defines interest rate sensitivity as the measurement of the mismatch in repricing characteristics of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments at a specified point in time 
this mismatch known as interest rate sensitivity gap represents the potential mismatch in the change in the rate of interest income and interest expense that would result from a change in interest rates
