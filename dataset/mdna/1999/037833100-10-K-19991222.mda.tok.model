item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section and other parts of this form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition below 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
all information is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
results of operations the following table sets forth annual results of operations for fiscal years   and in millions  except unit shipment and per share amounts change change net sales    macintosh cpu unit sales in thousands    gross margin    percentage of net sales research and development percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative  percentage of net sales special charges in process research and development restructuring costs termination of license agreement gains from sales of investment interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss  earnings loss per common share basic diluted the following table sets forth quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in millions  except unit shipment and per share amounts year ended september  year ended september  fourth third second first fourth third second first quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales         macintosh cpu unit sales in thousands gross margin gross margin percentage operating expenses special charges operating margin operating margin percentage gains from sales of investment interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income earnings per common share basic diluted overview during  the company experienced a rise in macintosh unit sales 
this increase is primarily attributable to the success of imac  the company s moderately priced desktop macintosh system designed for the education and consumer markets 
the company sold approximately million imac units in  an increase of approximately  units or over unit sales of similar products in growth in unit sales was strong in all of the company s geographic operating segments  particularly in japan and asia pacific due to strong acceptance of imac in those regions and the general economic improvements experienced in much of asia during the year 
the company also experienced improved profitability in operating income before special charges rose or million to million in from million in contributing to the improvement in operating margin in was a rise in gross margin as a percentage of net sales to as compared to in the impact of improved gross margins was partially offset by planned increases in recurring operating expenses during of to a total of billion 
despite improved unit sales and improved profitability  the company s net sales rose only in to billion 
growth in net sales was negatively impacted during the year by declines in the average revenue per macintosh system for both power macintosh and imac systems and by a shift in unit mix towards the lower priced imac systems 
net sales were also negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of due to lower than planned deliveries of powerpc g processors from motorola 
the primary focus of the company during fiscal remains achieving meaningful year over year growth in both unit sales and net sales 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market technologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions within the highly competitive market for personal computers 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition are discussed throughout this item  including the discussion under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
net sales net sales for geographic segments and macintosh unit sales by geographic segment and by product follow net sales in millions and macintosh unit sales in thousands change change americas net sales    europe net sales    japan net sales  asia pacific net sales americas macintosh unit sales    europe macintosh unit sales japan macintosh unit sales asia pacific macintosh unit sales total macintosh unit sales    power macintosh unit sales   powerbook unit sales imac unit sales a    ibook unit sales total macintosh unit sales    a unit sales figures for imac in and include sales of the company s previous consumer and education oriented macintosh products 
net sales increased million or to billion in compared to the primary source of this growth was an overall increase in macintosh unit sales  which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the company s geographic operating segments 
offsetting the rise in unit shipments was a decline in the average revenue per macintosh system  a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total macintosh cpu unit sales  which fell to  from  in the decline during in the average revenue per macintosh system is attributable to lower pricing for both imac and power macintosh products  which reflects the continuing overall industry trend towards lower pricing 
the decline is also attributable to the shift in the company s unit mix toward lower priced consumer products such that imac units and comparable products comprised of total macintosh unit sales in versus in net sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter by million or  and declined million or compared to the same period in similarly  macintosh unit sales declined and during the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of and the same period in  respectively 
the primary causes for these declines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of powerpc g processors from motorola and production interruptions at vendors supplying powerbooks and ibooks experienced during the last week of the fourth quarter of as a result of the earthquake in taiwan on september  the shortage of g processors reduced net sales by approximately million during the fourth quarter of net sales decreased billion  or  to billion in compared to the decline during in net sales is attributable to several factors 
the company experienced a million decrease in net sales of peripheral products during compared to principally due to the discontinuance by the company of certain imaging and display products 
the average revenue per macintosh system fell during as compared to from  to  reflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the company s power macintosh g systems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal  the decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral products  the overall industry trend toward lower priced products  and the company s reentry during the fourth quarter of into the lower priced consumer market 
lastly  overall macintosh cpu unit sales for declined approximately from international net sales were particularly affected by these factors and by the economic conditions existing in asia during segment operating performance the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis 
the company s geographic segments include the americas  europe  japan  and asia pacific 
the americas segment includes both north and south america 
the european segment includes european countries as well as the middle east and africa 
the japan segment includes only japan  while the asia pacific segment includes australia and asia except for japan 
each geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services 
further information regarding the company s operating segments may be found in part ii  item on this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note  segment information and geographic data  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
americas net sales in the americas segment increased to billion during as compared to  while macintosh unit sales increased 
this followed a decline in net sales in the americas between and during  the americas segment represented approximately and of the company s total net sales and total macintosh unit sales  respectively 
the results experienced by this segment in reflect the overall trends experienced by the company of growing macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per macintosh system 
europe net sales in the europe segment increased to billion during as compared to  while macintosh unit sales increased 
this followed a decline in net sales in the europe segment between and like the americas segment  europe s results in as compared to are indicative of strong growth in macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per macintosh system 
japan and asia pacific macintosh unit sales and net sales in asia  particularly in japan  recovered during from the declines experienced in net sales in the japan segment increased or million to a total of million in as compared to macintosh unit sales in japan increased during compared to while macintosh unit sales in the asia pacific segment increased 
the increases in net sales and macintosh unit sales in both japan and asia pacific are the result of strong imac sales experienced by these operating segments  strong growth in japanese consumer sales  and the general economic recovery experienced in the region 
backlog in the company s experience  the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects 
in particular  backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages 
backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply 
because of the foregoing  backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 
further information regarding the company s backlog may be found below under the subheading product introductions and transitions included under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
gross margin gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during to as compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to declines in the cost of various components of the company s products  improvements in manufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final assembly of certain of the company s products  improved design of products leading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs  and relatively stable pricing of the company s products over the last six months of during  the company was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily in and that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient distribution model for its products 
these improvements are discussed below 
gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during to compared to in this increase was primarily the result of a shift in revenue mix toward the company s higher margin power macintosh g systems and newer powerbook g systems  the low volume of lower margin consumer products shipped during the first three quarters of  and the declining cost of various components of the company s products  particularly those sourced from asia 
improvements in the company s inventory management also contributed to the increase in gross margins 
during  the company simplified its product line  moving from approximately separate individual products to three main product families 
further  the company attempted to use as many industry standard parts in its newer products as possible  expanded the use of supplier hubs at manufacturing sites  and outsourced the manufacture of printed circuit boards and some systems assembly 
these changes have allowed the company to more accurately forecast demand  reduce inventory carrying levels and related costs  lessen the financial exposure resulting from inventory obsolescence and excess inventory levels  and reduce the component cost of obtaining certain standardized parts 
the company also made changes to its distribution model during and that contributed to the increase in gross margins in the company significantly reduced the number of locations where it stages finished goods  generally holding inventory on a regional basis rather than in each country 
also  the company significantly reduced the number of its distributors  authorized resellers  and national retail channel partners  particularly in the united states 
these changes allowed the company to reduce inventory and related financial exposures and reduced the inventory and related financial exposure associated with inventory held in the company s distribution channels 
the company has also revised its distribution channel policies by decreasing the price protection and stock return privileges of its distributors and resellers 
the company anticipates that as lower priced consumer products become a larger share of net sales and the overall industry trend toward lower priced products continues  gross margins will decline during fiscal the foregoing statement is forward looking 
the company s actual results could differ because of several factors  including those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services  and potential changes to the company s product mix  including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins 
in response to these downward pressures  the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
research and development the company recognizes focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company s core business strategy 
expenditures on research and development increased or million to million in as compared to this followed a million or decline in as compared to the overall decline in spending on research and development over the last two years is principally due to restructuring actions taken in   and intended to focus the company s research and development efforts on those projects perceived as critical to the company s future success 
these restructuring actions led to significant reductions in research and development related headcount and the cancellation of many research and development projects 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenditures increased to million in as compared to and increased to of net sales in from in these increases are primarily the result of increased spending on marketing and promotional activities throughout and a increase in combined sales  marketing  and general and administrative headcount from the end of to the end of selling  general  and administrative expenditures declined million or in compared to and declined to of net sales in from of net sales in these decreases were primarily the result of restructuring actions taken in   and  which resulted in reductions in headcount  closing of facilities  and write down and disposal of operating assets during   and additionally  changes during in the company s distribution channel policies and business model  including contraction and focus of the company s product line and simplification of the company s internal and external distribution channels  led to a reduction in selling expenses during special charges and restructuring actions in the second quarter of  the company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and return the company to profitability 
the restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for the company s products and the company s adoption of a new strategic direction 
these actions resulted in a charge during of million 
during  the company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan 
the company recognized a million charge during for the estimated incremental costs of those actions 
all material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were essentially complete at the end of fiscal the combined and restructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately  full time employees  canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those employee terminations  writing down certain land  buildings  and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational functions  and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not critical to the company s core business strategy 
the restructuring actions under the plan resulted in cash expenditures of million and noncash asset write downs of million from the second quarter of through september  of the combined and restructuring charges of million  approximately million was determined to be excess during the fourth quarter of the remaining balance of million as of september   in accrued restructuring costs for the and restructuring actions is comprised of payments over the next two years on leases and contracts that had been terminated prior to fiscal the company expects the remaining accrual will result in cash expenditures of million over the next two years 
restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of  the company initiated restructuring actions resulting in a charge to operations of million 
the net restructuring charge of million recognized during the fourth quarter of reflects the million of excess reserves related to the and restructuring actions 
the total cost of these actions of million is comprised of million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the company s outsourced data center and million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued 
the company expects these actions to result in cash expenditures of million over the next year 
during the second quarter of  the company took certain actions to improve the flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final assembly of certain of its products to third party manufacturers 
these restructuring actions resulted in the company recognizing a charge to operations of approximately million during the second quarter of  which was comprised of million for severance benefits to be paid to employees involuntarily terminated  million for the write down of operating assets to be disposed of  and million for payments on canceled contracts 
these actions resulted in the termination of approximately employees and are substantially complete as of september  in process research and development in may  the company acquired certain technology that was under development and had no alternative future use 
the acquisition resulted in the recognition of million of purchased in process research and development  which was charged to operations upon acquisition 
in february  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of next software  inc next 
next had developed  marketed  and supported software enabling customers to implement business applications on the internet world wide web  intranets and enterprise wide client server networks 
of the total purchase price of million  million was allocated to purchased in process research and development and million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchased in process research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition  and the goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over two to three years 
termination of license agreement in august  the company agreed to acquire certain assets of power computing corporation pcc  a licensed distributor of the mac os operating system  including pcc s customer database and its license to distribute the mac os 
the agreement with pcc also included a release of claims between the parties 
on january   the company completed its acquisition of certain assets from pcc 
the total purchase price was approximately million  of which million was expensed in the fourth quarter of as termination of license agreement and million was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of the goodwill is being amortized over three years 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income and expense net increased million or to million during as compared to this increase is attributable to two primary factors 
first  the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased million or during resulting in an increase in interest income during of million 
second  interest expense declined million during  primarily as a result of the conversion of approximately million of the company s convertible subordinated notes to common stock during the third quarter of during  the company experienced a million increase in interest income net of interest expense  the result of higher cash and investment balances and lower average short term borrowings  offset by decreased foreign exchange gains and increased other expense 
gains from sales of investment as of september   the company owned of the outstanding stock of arm holdings plc arm  a privately held company in the united kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology 
the company had accounted for this investment using the equity method through september  on april   arm completed an initial public offering of its stock on the london stock exchange and the nasdaq national market 
the company sold of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately million  which was recognized as other income 
foreign tax recognized on this gain was approximately million 
at the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value  the equity method requires the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the investor s share of the change in the investee s shareholders equity resulting from the sale 
it is the company s policy to record an adjustment reflecting its share of the change in the investee s shareholders equity resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income 
consequently  the company also recognized in the third quarter of other income of approximately million to reflect its remaining ownership interest in the increased net book value of arm following its initial public offering 
as of september   the carrying value of the company s investment in arm carried in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately million 
on october   the company sold million shares split adjusted of arm stock 
as a result of this sale  the company s ownership interest in arm fell to 
consequently  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the company ceased accounting for its remaining investment in arm using the equity method and categorized its remaining shares as available for sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
during fiscal  the company sold approximately million shares split adjusted of arm stock for net proceeds of approximately million  recorded a gain before taxes of approximately million  and recognized related income tax of approximately million 
as of september   the company s remaining million shares of arm stock are valued at million 
the fair value of the company s investment in arm is reflected in other assets as of september   with an offsetting amount net of million of related deferred income taxes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
provision benefit for income taxes as of september   the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the company s balance sheet 
a substantial portion of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities 
as of september   a valuation allowance of million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized 
the valuation allowance relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from next and to tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes were provided 
the internal revenue service irs has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for the years through  and the company has made certain prepayments thereon 
the company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the united states tax court  and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved 
on june   the irs proposed income tax adjustments for the years through although most of the issues for these years have been resolved  certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the company 
management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
the company anticipates its effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately 
the foregoing statement is forward looking 
the company s actual results could differ because of several factors  including those set forth below in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
additionally  the actual future tax rate will be significantly impacted by the amount of and jurisdiction in which the company s foreign profits are earned 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in millions cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments    accounts receivable  net  inventory working capital    days sales in accounts receivable a days of supply in inventory b operating cash flow a based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period 
b based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period 
as of september   the company had billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  an increase of million or over the same balances at the end of fiscal during fiscal  the company s primary source of cash was million in cash flows from operating activities 
cash generated by operations was primarily from net income  declines in accounts receivables and inventory resulting from improved asset management  and an increase in accounts payable 
the company s cash and cash equivalent balances as of september  and  include million and million  respectively  pledged as collateral to support letters of credit 
in addition to the net purchase of short term investments of billion  net cash used by investing activities included million for the purchase of investments in samsung and akamai discussed below and million for the purchase of fixed assets 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of arm stock of million and proceeds from the sale of equipment of million 
the company expects the level of capital expenditures in will increase moderately from in july  the company s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
this repurchase plan does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time 
as of september   the company had repurchased a total of million shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
on november   the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with bank of america 
loans under the agreement pay interest at libor plus  and the company is required to pay a commitment fee of of the unused portion of the credit facility 
no advances have been made against this credit facility 
this revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the company with an additional source of liquidity and to provide additional support to the company s capital position in the event of short term liquidity disturbances in worldwide financial markets associated with the year crossover 
the company believes its balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months  including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan 
however  given the company s current non investment grade debt ratings  if the company should need to obtain short term borrowings  there can no assurance such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates 
the inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
other long term investments as discussed above  the company has categorized its shares in arm as available for sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of september   the company held million shares of arm stock valued at million 
during the first quarter of fiscal through december   the company sold an additional million shares of arm stock for net proceeds of approximately million and gains before taxes of approximately million 
as of december   the company holds million shares of arm stock valued at approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company invested million in samsung electronics co  ltd samsung to assist in the further expansion of samsung s tft lcd flat panel display production capacity 
the investment  in the form of three year unsecured bonds  is convertible into approximately  shares of samsung common stock beginning in june the bonds carry an annual coupon rate of and pay a total yield to maturity of if redeemed at their maturity 
in june  the company invested million in akamai technologies  inc akamai  a global internet content delivery service 
the investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into million shares of akamai common stock adjusted for subsequent stock splits at the time of akamai s initial public offering in october the company is restricted from selling more than of its shares within one year after the date of the closing of a public offering of akamai s stock 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the company has categorized its shares in akamai as available for sale requiring they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   the fair value of the company s investment in akamai was approximately billion 
because akamai is a newly public company and its stock price has experienced significant volatility  the fair value of the company s investment in akamai may fluctuate significantly in the future 
year compliance the information presented below related to year yk compliance contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k regarding yk compliance 
year the year yk issue is the result of certain computer hardware  operating system software and software application programs having been developed using two digits rather than four to define a year 
for example  the clock circuit in the hardware may be incapable of holding a date beyond the year  some operating systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than and certain applications may have limited date processing capabilities 
these problems could result in the failure of major systems or miscalculations  which could have a material impact on companies through business interruption or shutdown  financial loss  damage to reputation  and legal liability to third parties 
yk plan the company s information systems and technology department is t began addressing the yk issue in as part of its next generation strategy  which addressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement of the company s various disparate legacy information technology it systems 
in  the company established a year executive steering committee steering committee comprised of senior executives of the company and the company s year project management office pmo 
the pmo reports to the executive vice president and chief financial officer  the steering committee  and the audit and finance committee of the board of directors 
the pmo developed and manages the company s worldwide yk strategic plan yk plan to address the potential impact of yk on the company s operations and business processes 
in particular  the yk plan addresses four principal areas that may be impacted by the yk issue apple branded products  third party relationships  non it business systems  and it systems 
with respect to the it systems and non it business systems  the yk plan consists of four separate but overlapping phases phase i inventory and risk assessment  phase ii remediation cost estimation  phase iii remediation  and phase iv remediation testing 
in addition  the company has an ongoing yk awareness program designed to keep employees informed about yk issues 
the discussion below reflects management s estimate of the current status of the four principal areas of the company s yk plan 
regardless of the current status  all areas of the yk plan remain under review and subject to modification as deemed necessary throughout the remainder of calendar through the date rollover and into january apple branded products the company designs and manufactures personal computers  related peripherals  operating system software and application software  including macintosh personal computers and the mac os  which are marketed under the apple brand collectively apple branded products 
the company tested certain apple branded products to determine yk compliance  although such testing did not include third party products bundled with apple branded products and certain apple branded products no longer distributed and or supported by the company 
for purposes of this discussion  yk compliant means a product will not produce errors processing date data in connection with the year change from december   to january   when used with accurate date data in accordance with its documentation  provided all other products including other software  firmware and hardware used with it properly exchange date data with it 
a yk compliant product will recognize the year as a leap year 
information about testing and yk compliance of apple branded products is available on the apple corporate web site under the heading year readiness disclosure  at www 
apple 
com about year 
such information  which is updated on an ongoing basis  is not to be considered part of this annual report 
because the company does not control the design of non apple branded products or third party products that are bundled with apple branded products  it cannot assure such products are yk compliant 
some apple branded products installed at customer sites may require upgrades or other remediation 
while the company believes its customers are responsible for the yk readiness of their it and business environments  the company has taken steps to assist customers in achieving their readiness goals 
apple is issuing software updates at no additional charge for most  but not all  known issues in certain apple branded products 
third party relationships the company s business operations are heavily dependent on third party corporate service vendors  materials suppliers  outsourced operations partners  distributors and others 
the company is working with key external parties to identify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of yk 
the failure of external parties to resolve their own yk issues in a timely manner could result in a material financial risk to the company 
as part of its yk plan and to establish the state of readiness of certain third parties  the company is actively communicating on an ongoing basis with certain third parties whose lack of yk compliance would present a high degree of risk to the company 
based on information obtained from various sources  the company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions around the world in critical services such as air traffic control  airfreight transportation  customs clearance  telecommunications  and power utilities early in calendar year that could result in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods 
the company also believes it is reasonably possible that worldwide financial markets could exhibit unusual short term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of calendar and at the beginning of calendar such events could result in material adverse effects on the company s results of operations and financial position 
see further discussion regarding this issue below under the heading contingency plans 
the company has substantially completed its review of certain third parties as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal although numerous third parties have advised the company they are addressing their yk issues  the readiness of third parties overall varies widely 
because the company s yk compliance is dependent on the timely yk compliance of third parties  there can be no assurances the company s efforts alone will resolve all yk issues 
the company continues to communicate with and monitor the compliance efforts of key third parties 
the company will continue these efforts with key third parties through the date rollover and into january it systems and non it business systems phase i inventory and risk assessment this phase requires an inventory and assessment of the non it business systems used by the company  including systems with embedded technology  building access systems  and health and safety systems 
this phase also includes inventory and assessment of it systems used by the company  including large is t systems  desktop hardware and software  and network hardware and software 
each system is evaluated and the business risk is quantified as being high  medium or low risk to the company s business 
systems that are high risk are those  which if uncorrected  would cause an interruption of or complete failure to conduct the company s business 
medium risks are those that would negatively impact the business but complete cessation could be avoided with some inconvenience 
low risks are those where the risk to business interruption or cessation are remote 
the company intends that high and medium risk items will be remediated or replaced  and low risk items will likely not be addressed prior to the year the status of the company s remediation efforts is discussed below 
the company had substantially completed the inventory and risk assessment phase for both it systems and non it systems by the end of the third quarter of fiscal however  the company has and will continue to review information developed as the result of its yk plan  which could result in additional items being added to its yk inventory 
phase ii remediation cost estimation this phase involves the analysis of each high and medium risk to determine how such risks may be remediated and the cost of such remediation 
the company has substantially completed this phase for both it and non it business systems 
phase iii remediation this phase includes the replacement or correction of the high and medium risk non it business systems and it systems 
the company substantially completed this phase for both it and non it business systems during the fourth quarter of fiscal phase iv remediation testing this phase includes the future date testing of the remediation efforts made in phase iii to confirm that the changes made bring the affected systems into compliance  no new problems have arisen as a result of the remediation  and new systems that replaced noncompliant systems are yk compliant 
the company substantially completed this phase for both it and non it business systems during the first quarter of fiscal costs to address yk the costs of the yk program are primarily costs associated with the utilization of existing internal resources and incremental external spending 
the company s current estimate of total incremental external spending over the life of its yk plan to address those risks identified as high or medium is approximately million of which approximately million had been spent as of september  as the company s yk plan continues  the actual future incremental spending may prove to be higher 
also  this estimate does not include the costs that could be incurred by the company if one or more of its significant third party vendors fails to achieve yk compliance 
the company is not separately identifying and including in these estimates the yk costs incurred that are the result of utilization of the company s existing internal resources 
contingency plans under the guidance and management of the pmo  the company is in the final stages of developing  implementing  and testing yk contingency plans for critical business operations 
the company s contingency plans  which are based in part on the assessment of the magnitude and probability of potential risks  primarily focus on proactive steps to prevent yk failures from occurring  or if they should occur  to detect them quickly  minimize their impact and expedite their remediation 
the yk contingency plans will supplement existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans 
as part of its contingency plans  the company has developed a global incident management team imt to identify  escalate  and mitigate the potential impact of various yk failures 
the imt is comprised of personnel from the pmo as well as key areas of the company s operations 
the imt will begin to monitor the date rollover commencing with sydney  australia and will follow the sun through the time change in the pacific standard time zone 
the company s contingency planning efforts were approximately complete at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and are expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal the company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions in air traffic control  airfreight transportation  customs clearance  telecommunications  and power utilities early in calendar year that could result in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods and other business interruptions 
the company has developed and implemented contingency plans to mitigate the effects of a short term interruption in such services 
however  if the interruption in these services last for an extended period of time  or if alternative yk compliant services are not readily available at reasonable cost  there could be material adverse effects on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company also believes it is reasonably possible worldwide financial markets could exhibit unusual short term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of calendar and at the beginning of calendar the company has developed and implemented contingency plans to mitigate some of the potential short term effects of such disturbances 
however  if these disturbances in the financial markets last for an extended period of time  or if alternative mitigating actions are not readily available at reasonable cost  there could be material adverse effects on the company s results of operations and financial position 
risk factors associated with yk issues the company has substantially completed its initial assessment of reasonably likely worst case scenarios of non it business systems and or it systems failures and related consequences 
based on current information  the company believes the most likely worst case scenario is it will experience minor malfunctions and failures of its it systems and non it business systems at the beginning of the year not previously detected during the company s inventory and risk assessment and remediation activities 
the company currently believes these malfunctions and failures will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
however  there can be no assurance the yk remediation by the company or third parties will be properly and timely completed  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company  its business  its results of operations  and its financial condition 
in particular  the company believes a lack of yk readiness by its significant third party vendors could cause material interruptions in the company s operations 
the identification of additional issues with respect to the yk compliance of key third parties could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  important factors that could cause results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the ability of the company to successfully identify systems and vendors that have a yk issue  the nature and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected systems  the adequacy of such remediation efforts  the production related contingency plans of competitors with the company s third party suppliers  and the costs and availability of labor and resources to successfully address the yk issues and or to execute on any required contingency plans 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition competition the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
the company s results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality  hardware performance  and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including consumer  education and publishing 
additionally  several of the company s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design and technical features of the company s products 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
additionally  the company s future operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another 
the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing microsoft windows operating systems 
the company believes the innovative industrial design of its products  the unique set of features its products currently provide  the perceived advantages of the mac os over windows  and the general reluctance of the macintosh installed base to incur the costs of switching platforms  have been driving forces behind sales of the company s personal computer hardware in recent years 
the company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the windows platform 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms 
product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
the company plans to continue to introduce upgrades to the current mac os  mac os  and later introduce a new operating system  mac os x client  which is expected to offer advanced functionality based on apple and next software technologies 
it is uncertain whether mac os x will gain developer support and market acceptance 
inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially backward compatible mac os x or of planned enhancements to the current mac os  or to gain developer support and market acceptance for those operating systems  may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
inventory and supply the company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand and accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled 
although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate  given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry  no assurance can be given the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  such charges have had  and may again have  a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
many of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers 
in addition  the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company remains at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service 
accordingly  in the event of product defects or warranty liability  the company may remain primarily liable 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
although certain components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources  other key components including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources 
some other key components including without limitation dram and tft lcd flat panel displays  while currently available to the company from multiple sources  are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained  the company s business and financial performance could be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source  or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products  due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products such as the cellular phone and automotive industries 
finally  the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company s requirements 
such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the company s net sales and adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and motorola  the sole suppliers of the powerpc risc based microprocessor for the company s macintosh computers  to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company s competitors by intel corporation  and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the windows operating systems 
further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading raw materials  and in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note under the subheading concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and product  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
marketing and distribution the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers and cataloguers  and directly to education institutions for resale collectively referred to as resellers 
in addition  the company also sells many of its products in most of its major markets directly to end users through its on line store 
many of the company s significant resellers operate on narrow product margins 
most such resellers also distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened  if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products causes resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading markets and distribution  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
global market risks a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have recently experienced weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect consumer demand for the company s products  the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales  the availability and cost of product components to the company  and consequently the company s results of operations 
further information related to the company s global market risks may be found in part ii  item a of this form k under the subheading foreign currency risk and may be found in part ii  item of this form k at notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
support from third party software developers decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications 
the company believes the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger windows market 
this analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the company s financial losses in prior years and declining demand for the company s products  as well as the company s decision to end its mac os licensing program  have caused software developers to question the company s prospects in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
moreover  the company s current plan to introduce mac os x could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current mac os 
in addition  there can be no assurance software developers will decide to develop software for the new operating system on a timely basis or at all 
in august  the company and microsoft entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements 
in addition  for a period of five years from august  as subject to certain limitations related to the number of macintosh computers sold by the company  microsoft will make future versions of its microsoft office and internet explorer products for the mac os 
the company will bundle the internet explorer product with mac os system software releases and make that product the default internet browser for such releases 
while the company believes its relationship with microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the mac os  the microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the company competes with microsoft  including the windows platform 
accordingly  microsoft s interest in producing application software for the mac os not covered by the relationship or following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by microsoft s perception of its interests as the vendor of the windows operating system 
in addition  the microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on  among other things  the company s relationship with other partners 
there can be no assurance the benefits to the company of the microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro is now traded on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
a three year transition period began during which transactions can be made in the old currencies 
the company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities  review the ability of financial institution vendors to support euro transactions  and examine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the euro conversion 
the cost of this effort is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  all issues related to the euro conversion have been identified and that any additional issues would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the conversion to the euro may have competitive implications on the company s pricing and marketing strategies  the impact of which are not known at this time 
additionally  the company is at risk to the extent its principal european suppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the euro conversion 
other factors the potential risks associated with the company s yk plan are discussed above under the heading year compliance 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations  including certain major vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement that the company provide consumers with the ability to return to the company product at the end of its useful life  and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws  no assurance can be given such laws  or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment  will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
item a 
disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions  as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios  the company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions  and its interest rate swap  option and floor positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures  respectively  from both an accounting and an economic perspective 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge  there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed with respect to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investments and long term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments 
as of september   substantially all of the company s investments have maturities less than months 
during  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible subordinated notes the notes to certain qualified parties in a private placement 
the notes were sold at of par 
the notes paid interest semiannually and matured  if not converted earlier  on june  the notes were convertible by their holders at any time after september   at a conversion price of per share subject to adjustments as defined in the note agreement 
no notes had been converted as of september  the notes were redeemable by the company at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest  for the month period beginning june   and at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest  for the month period beginning june  in addition  the company incurred approximately million of costs associated with the issuance of the notes 
these costs were accounted for as a deduction from the face amount of the notes and were being amortized over the life of the notes 
on april   the company called for redemption the notes 
not including approximately million of unamortized debt issuance costs  debentures in an aggregate principal amount outstanding totaled approximately million as of march  during the third quarter of  debenture holders chose to convert virtually all of the outstanding debentures to common stock at a rate of per share resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
during  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the sec 
the notes were sold at of par  for an effective yield to maturity of 
the notes pay interest semiannually and mature on february  the following table presents the principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates for the company s investment portfolio and its long term debt obligations 
the long term debt is comprised of million of unsecured notes described above  which mature in february the company s us corporate securities include commercial paper  loan participations  certificates of deposit  time deposits and corporate debt securities 
foreign securities include foreign commercial paper  loan participation  certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions  most of which are denominated in us dollars

the company receives a payment when interest rates fall below a predetermined level 
a purchased floor generally qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and is reported on the balance sheet at its premium cost  which is amortized over the life of the floor 
the purchased floors are generally designated and effective as hedges against interest rate risk on the company s securities classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
purchased floors outstanding as of september   provided the company with the option of a weighted average interest rate of on the notional amount of million 
there were no purchased floors outstanding as of september  gains and losses are recognized in income as a component of interest and other income expense  net in the same period as the hedged transaction 
unrealized gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial as of september  during the last two years  the company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions  including interest rate swaps and floors  with financial institutions in order to better match the company s floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt  and or to diversify a portion of the company s exposure away from fluctuations in short term us interest rates 
the company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program 
the company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management 
the interest rate swaps qualifying as accounting hedges generally require the company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month us dollar libor and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts 
these swaps effectively convert the company s fixed rate year debt to floating rate debt and convert the floating rate investments to fixed rate 
the maturity date for million of the asset swaps is october with the remaining debt and asset swaps maturing in february and september of as of september  and  interest rate debt swaps had a weighted average receive rate of 
the weighted average pay rate on the debt swaps was and as of september  and  respectively 
as of september   interest rate asset swaps had a weighted average receive rate of and a weighted average pay rate of 
the unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a component of interest and other income expense  net in the same period as the hedged transaction 
deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately million as of september   while deferred gains on such contracts totaled million as of september  foreign currency risk overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  and probable but not firmly committed transactions 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures 
however  the company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal us dollar value or in terms of the related currency s historically high correlation with the us dollar 
foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities 
the premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and marked to market through earnings 
probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the company s products and purchases of raw material  sub assemblies  and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency 
a majority of these transactions are made through the company s subsidiaries in europe  asia particularly japan  canada  and australia 
the company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions 
the company also sells foreign exchange option contracts  in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts 
the term of the company s foreign exchange hedging instruments  whether for firmly committed transactions  probable but not firmly committed transactions  or to partially finance the foreign risk management program  currently does not extend beyond six months 
gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in income as a component of interest and other income expense  net
