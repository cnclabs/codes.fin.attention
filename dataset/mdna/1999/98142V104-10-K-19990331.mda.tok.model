in  wet lease contracts accounted for of total block hours compared with in operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in block hours flown  partially offset by a shift in business from acmi flying to full service flying 
also  in the company received approximately million in revenue associated with minimum guarantee payments from malaysian airlines versus approximately million from malaysian airlines and another customer in operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in flight expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft cost  fuel and maintenance 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in cockpit headcount partially offset by an increase in flight attendant costs and passenger food due to the shift to more full service flying 
also  in the company accrued profit sharing expenses as a result of earnings experienced during that period 
no such accrual was made in maintenance expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average number of aircraft from to and the reduction in hours flown 
this was partially offset by an additional maintenance accrual of million relating to an engine overhaul in the first quarter of and the normal increase in maintenance costs generally experienced with aging aircraft fleets 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in costs associated with the md aircraft and related engines as a result of certain manufacturer guarantees and warranties that were fully expired in the company expects its maintenance expense to increase further in future years due to escalations in the specified rates per flight hour under the company s maintenance agreement for md engines 
aircraft costs decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease reflects the return of one md aircraft  one dc aircraft and two engines in it also reflects a reduction in insurance policy rates 
fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase reflects the increase in full service block hours flown partially offset by a decrease in average fuel prices 
commissions decreased million in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from the end of the philippine airlines contract in february partially offset by expenses incurred in connection with increased revenues relating to increased amc flying

flight attendant costs remained consistent despite the shift to wet lease operations as a result of flight attendants receiving minimum guarantee payments 
maintenance expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in the number of aircraft dedicated to the company s continuing operations and the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet during in addition  the company experienced an increase in costs associated with md aircraft and engines as a result of certain manufacturer guarantees and warranties that began to expire in the increase was partially offset by a reversal in of million of accrued maintenance expense in excess of the cost of an overhaul of a dc aircraft 
aircraft costs increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted from the increase in the number of aircraft dedicated to the company s continuing operations  primarily due to the lease of two md er aircraft in march  and the lease of additional spare engines necessary to support the expanded fleet 
this increase was partially offset by the reversal of approximately million in lease costs  which had been recorded in  as a result of a settlement with the engine manufacturer for reimbursements related to disputed spare engine lease charges 
fuel expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease is due primarily to the shift from full service to wet lease operations 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in price per gallon 
commissions increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in commissions related to increased flying during under a philippine airlines contract 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from depreciation on the increased levels of spare parts required to support the additional md aircraft described above  partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of certain intangible assets 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel to support the growth in the company s marketing efforts beginning in the second quarter of and an increase in property tax accruals 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in legal and professional fees 
interest expense increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the issuance of million of the debentures in august discontinued operations 
the company commenced service between tel aviv and new york in july in the first quarter of  the company generated million in losses related to these operations 
in the second quarter of  the company expanded its scheduled service operations with service between the united states and south africa and introduced scheduled charter operations between the united states and various destinations within europe 
as the company was unable to operate these scheduled service operations profitably  in july the company announced its decision to exit its scheduled service operations by october and focus its operations on its core wet lease operations 
consistent with this decision  world airways ceased all scheduled operations as of october  as a result  the company s scheduled service operations were reflected as discontinued operations as of june   and prior period results were restated to reflect scheduled service operations as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations net of income tax effect approximated million for the year ended december  in addition  an estimated loss on disposal of million net of income tax effect was recorded as of june  the company recognized an additional million of expense in the fourth quarter of and believes that substantially all the costs relating to the disposal were recorded as of december  the company is subject to claims arising as a result of the discontinuance of its scheduled service operations  but the company believes it has substantial defenses to these actions 
liquidity and capital resources the company is highly leveraged 
the company has incurred substantial debt and lease commitments in connection with its acquisition of md aircraft and related spare parts 
as of december   the company had outstanding long term debt and capital leases of million  and notes payable and current maturities of long term obligations of million 
in addition  the company has significant future long term obligations relating to operating leases for aircraft and spare engines 
the company has historically financed working capital and capital expenditure requirements out of cash flow from operating activities  sales of its common stock  secured borrowings  and other financing from banks and other lenders 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences including i world airways ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be limited  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  iii world airways degree of leverage and related debt service obligations  as well as its obligations under operating leases  may make it more vulnerable than some of its competitors in a prolonged economic downturn  iv world airways ability to meet its payment obligations under existing and future indebtedness  capital leases and operating leases may be limited  and v world airways financial position may restrict its ability to pursue new business opportunities and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business conditions see business control by worldcorp in item  for information about worldcorp which has filed for bankruptcy protection 
world airways cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
as is common in the airline industry  world airways operates with a working capital deficit 
at december   world airways current assets were million and current liabilities were million 
world airways also has substantial long term debt and aircraft lease obligations with respect to its current aircraft fleet 
in the event that world airways enters into leases for additional aircraft  the company will need to make capital expenditures for additional spare engines and parts 
no assurances can be given  however  that the company will obtain all of the financing required for such capital expenditures 
although there can be no assurances  world airways believes that its existing contracts and additional business which it expects to obtain  along with its existing cash  unencumbered assets that can be utilized to generate cash and other financing arrangements  will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its cash requirements related to operating and capital requirements for in the company reached an agreement with its principal aircraft lessors that will reduce lease and maintenance reserve cash requirements for by approximately million 
the company is pursuing other efforts to improve its cash flow for and beyond by a company wide program that has been initiated to reduce operating costs and programs initiated to gain new business 
in the company will also undertake new initiatives with its aircraft lessors to help improve its ongoing cost structure with respect to its aircraft 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million in this decrease in cash in resulted primarily from the net loss incurred compared to net earnings in cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december   compared to million in in cash was used primarily for the purchase of parts to support the aircraft fleet and leasehold improvements on the corporate headquarters 
in  cash was used for the purchase of a spare engine  engine upgrades required for two md aircraft as well as for the purchase of rotable spare parts required to support the fleet 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to providing million in in cash was used primarily for a net reduction in debt of approximately million  for the purchase of shares of the company s common stock aggregating approximately million and for a loan to worldcorp of million  net 
in net cash of million was provided by the issuance of debt and cash was used to repay approximately million of debt and purchase treasury stock for approximately million 
capital commitments financing developments in march in conjunction with the lease of two md er aircraft the company agreed to assume an existing lease of two additional md freighter aircraft for years  beginning in  in the event that the existing lessee terminates its lease with the lessor at that time 
as of the date hereof  the company does not know if the existing lessee intends to terminate the existing lease or not 
as part of the agreement for the aircraft  the lessor provided spare parts financing of million of which approximately million has been received 
world airways capital expenditures for are currently expected to be approximately million  principally for the purchase of aircraft related assets which it expects to finance from working capital and the million remaining availability of the million spare parts financing 
also  as of december   the company had unencumbered aircraft engines and spare parts currently available for financing or sale which may generate additional funds 
other matters year the company has initiated a comprehensive and methodical program to review its computer systems to identify those that could be affected by the year issue 
the program is addressing the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year the multi facet program involves an inventory and assessment of all of the company s computer hardware and the operating systems and software installed thereon  an assessment of the year compliance of other companies  customers  suppliers  and government entities  with whom the company electronically exchanges data or depends on for aircraft operations  and those systems that one does not think of as computers  but nevertheless operate with embedded chips on which resides a systems calendar  such as computer routers  phone switches  and building security systems 
the company has completed the inventory and assessment of all of its hardware  operating systems and software and has made substantial progress in ensuring year compliance 
it is now expected that all such hardware  operating systems and software will either be upgraded or replaced by the end of the second quarter of where applications software is supplied by vendors the company has requested letters of certification from such vendors 
further  the company is testing and re testing all programs and program modifications made to ensure compliance on a separate computer server set up for year testing 
the company has received preliminary information indicating that the aircraft  including installed systems  it operates are year compliant  however  the company is continuing its endeavors to confirm and obtain a statement of warranty from the various manufacturers concerned 
the company s routers and phone switch are year complaint and building security compliance issues are under study 
the company has initiated identification of other entities with whom world airways is electronically interdependent and is assessing their year compliance through a series of surveys or other exchange mechanisms 
once that process is complete  methods to solve any potential interchange issues will be developed 
because this process will involve third parties  the company is presently unable to determine whether or not there will be any significant problems in ensuring year compliance 
incremental costs associated with changes that have been identified to ensure year compliance are not considered to be material to the company s financial position 
through december   the company s costs have totaled approximately  and the company estimates additional costs to be incurred will approximate  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in certain normal business activities or operations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  particularly as it involves third party suppliers and government entities  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  or financial position 
entities that supply the infrastructure critical to the airline industry  such as the air traffic control and related systems of the us federal aviation administration and international aviation authorities  the us department of transportation and local airport authorities worldwide are actively addressing the year issue 
the airline industry is actively involved in these efforts through the air transport association and the international air transport association 
it is likely that any year problems having an adverse impact on the airline industry worldwide would also have an adverse impact on world airways 
world airways would seek to mitigate the consequences of year problems  if any  on its flight operations by utilizing alternate flight plans to airports not experiencing year problems 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s revenues during the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk world airways does not have any material exposure to market risks 
with respect to interest rate risks  at december  interest rates on all of the company s long term debt and capitalized lease obligations aggregating million are fixed 
borrowings under the company s credit agreement  million at december   bear interest at prime plus 
based on the average outstanding month end balances during each change in the prime rate would have increased or decreased the company s interest cost by approximately  based on the balance outstanding at december  each change in the prime rate will increase or decrease the company s interest cost by approximately  on an annual basis 
see notes and of notes to financial statements in item the company has not entered into any obligations for trading purposes 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rate risks  although a significant percentage of the company s revenues are derived from foreign customers  all revenues and substantially all expenses are denominated in us dollars 
the company maintains minimal balances in foreign bank accounts to facilitate the payment of expenses 
see note of notes to financial statements in item the company is not exposed to commodity price risks except with respect to the purchase of aviation fuel 
however  fluctuations in the price of fuel have not had a significant impact on the company s operations in recent years because  in general  the company s contracts with its customers limit the company s exposure to increases in fuel prices 
the company purchases no fuel under long term contracts nor does the company enter into futures or swap contracts
