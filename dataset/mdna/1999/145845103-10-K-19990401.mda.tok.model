these amounts were expensed as part of marketing and selling expenses during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of

an example of the infrastructure improvements include costs to enhance the company s information services technology needed to meet financial reporting requirements as well as customer service demands 
the increases in personnel costs were attributable in large measure to the addition of a chief financial officer  a senior vice president  operations and a senior vice president  finance

net cash used in operating activities reflects uses of cash of million for an increase in accounts receivable and million for a decrease in accounts payable and sources of cash of million for an increase in accrued expenses and million for an increase in income taxes payable

during the prior year  no such significant devaluation of the rand occurred 
as discussed earlier  the company terminated its senior secured credit facility with credit agricole indosuez in july and currently has no revolving credit facility available 
however  the company retained approximately million of the proceeds from the secured term loan and the sale of cutex for working capital purposes
