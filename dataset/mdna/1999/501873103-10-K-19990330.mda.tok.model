item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
overview from inception in through  the company derived its revenues from the development of clinical diagnostics and research instruments for customers 
beginning in  the company began manufacturing and shipping these clinical diagnostics and research instruments to customers either for their internal use or for resale on an oem basis 
in the second half of  the company implemented a new strategic business model aimed at developing products for the emerging hts market  which enables accelerated drug discovery  by leveraging its existing technology platform and product development and manufacturing expertise 
in connection with this change in strategy  the company shifted its focus from developing and manufacturing oem clinical diagnostics and research products to developing  manufacturing and marketing its own products for hts 
as part of its shift in focus  the company has de emphasized its oem development activities and has phased out production of all but one of its oem instruments 
however  the company expects to support and may continue to manufacture products under its agreement with ventana medical systems  inc ventana through and possibly beyond 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease in revenues was due primarily to the significant decrease in revenues from oem and development agreements  which made up all of the revenue reported in the year ended december   partially offset by shipments of the company s first hts products in ljl began shipping and recognizing revenue on its first hts product  analyst  in the second quarter of  and its follow on ultra hts product  acquest  in the fourth quarter of  reporting combined systems sales in excess of million for the year ended december  no revenue was recognized under development agreements for the year ended december   as compared with million recognized under development agreements for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues from oem products and development agreements was due to the company s decision in to focus its future efforts on development of a proprietary hts product platform and not to pursue additional development or manufacturing agreements for oem products 
revenue from oem product sales was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
the decrease in oem product revenue was due to the company s increasing focus on its hts products and the phasing out of the luminometer a microplate reader  the q a clinical analyzer and the microplate heater products 
the company will have a small amount of revenue from oem product sales through but expects little or no oem product sales in future periods beyond the company expects little or no development revenue related to oem products in future periods 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the company s transition in product mix from mature oem products to its new line of hts products 
gross profit  as a percentage of product sales  was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of decreased absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from low volumes of hts unit sales early in the company expects that gross profit as a percentage of product sales  will remain low for the next several years until sales volumes for the analyst  acquest and related products increase and the company is able to spread its manufacturing costs over higher production levels 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the development of the company s hts product platform  partially offset by a decrease in the level of research and development expenses incurred in connection with development agreements for oem customers 
the company expects research and development expenditures to continue to increase in future periods to support the development of its hts product line 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to increases in marketing and sales expenses associated with the addition of sales and marketing personnel  as well as marketing expenses for the analyst and acquest  and other increases in general and administrative expenses which include the additional administrative costs of being a public company 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods for the reasons described above 
interest income  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  this increase was primarily due to interest earned on higher levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and investments in  as compared to  as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from the company s ipo 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  representing a decrease of million or 
revenue recognized under development agreements was million for the year ended december   as compared with million recognized under development agreements for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease in revenue recognized under development agreements was due primarily to the company s decision in to focus its future efforts on internal development of a proprietary hts product platform  the completion of its existing oem development agreements principally with combichem  inc  which accounted for million of the decrease  and its decision not to pursue additional development agreements 
revenue from oem product sales was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the company s increasing focus on its hts products and the phasing out of the luminometer a microplate reader  the q a clinical analyzer and the microplate heater products 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million or 
this was primarily due to decreased unit sales of the luminometer product 
gross profit  as a percentage of product sales  was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of decreased absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from reduced unit sales in research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in costs associated with the development of the company s hts product platform  partially offset by a million decrease in the level of research and development expenses incurred in connection with development agreements for oem customers 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the amount of s corporation distributions to the company s stockholders as compensation due to the company s change in tax status to a c corporation the company s stockholders paid s corporation taxes on their share of the company s taxable income on their individual tax returns  which was partially offset by a  increase in marketing and sales expenses associated with the addition of sales and marketing personnel and hts product marketing expenses and other increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest income  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  this increase was primarily due to interest earned on higher levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in  as compared to  as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from the company s private placement of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
income taxes prior to june  the company had been taxed as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
under the internal revenue code provisions regarding s corporations  the company had not been subject to federal income taxes but had been subject to state income taxes at a reduced rate 
as an s corporation  the company s stockholders paid taxes on their share of the company s taxable income in their individual tax returns 
in june  in connection with the preferred stock financing  the company became subject to the c corporation provisions of the internal revenue code pursuant to which the company s earnings are taxed for federal and state income tax purposes at the corporate level 
through june  the company s profits were distributed to the company s stockholders through a combination of compensation  which was treated as an expense in the statement of operations  and dividends 
future distributions are not expected 
at december   the company had net operating loss nol carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes  which expire from to a full valuation allowance has been provided for the nol and all other deferred tax assets as management does not consider their realization more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million  working capital of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
the company completed its initial public offering of its common stock in march  raising approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts and associated costs 
in april  the company sold an additional  shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of an over allotment option granted to the underwriters and received cash proceeds  net of underwriting commissions and associated costs  of approximately million 
prior to its ipo  the company satisfied its liquidity needs primarily through cash flows generated from operations  private sales of preferred stock  and to a lesser extent  from bank loans for equipment purchases and loans from stockholders 
net cash from operating activities has historically fluctuated based on the timing of receipt of customer deposits  working capital changes resulting from varying levels of manufacturing activities and fluctuations in the company s net income loss 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million  million and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operations was primarily due to the company s net losses for and of million and million  respectively 
the increase was also attributable to the company s reduced emphasis on development agreements and oem manufacturing  which resulted in certain changes in working capital  including lower customer deposits  as well as by increased inventory and accounts receivable balances related to production and sales of the company s new hts line of products 
the increase was partially offset by the company s increased accruals which consist primarily of accrued employee costs  warranty accruals  accrued public company related expenses and accrued professional services  all of which are related to the company going public  introducing its new hts product line and increasing its headcount during net cash from investing activities totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
this increase in was primarily due to the company s net investment of million in investment grade  interest bearing financial instruments 
these financial instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and may fluctuate in value if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company attempts to limit this exposure by primarily investing in short term investments 
the increases in net cash used in investing activities were also due to increases in equipment purchases during the years ended december  and  primarily due to the purchase of additional equipment needed to develop and manufacture the company s new hts products 
net cash from financing activities totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash from financing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the same periods in and  was primarily due to the company s ipo and the related exercise of an over allotment option granted to the underwriters  which raised approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts and associated costs 
the change in financing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the company s private placement of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  which raised approximately million in cash 
net cash from financing activities for the years ended december  and also included million and million in s corporation distributions to the company s stockholders 
in february  the company entered into an equipment financing agreement that provides a million line of credit that can be used to finance the purchases of equipment  computers and software necessary to support the company s hts development effort and additions to the marketing  sales and administrative infrastructure 
at december   the company had a line of credit obligation of million 
in june  the company entered into a development  license and sales agreement with fluorrx  inc fluorrx under which it obtained worldwide rights to certain patented assay technologies 
in august  the company amended certain terms of this agreement 
future minimum royalty payments due through under the agreement will amount to approximately million in aggregate 
the source of funds for these royalty payments is expected to be primarily the proceeds from the sale of hts products developed by the company pursuant to this agreement 
on january   the company raised net cash proceeds of million in connection with a private placement of million shares of unregistered restricted common stock 
the terms of the sale require that the company file a registration statement covering such shares by july  the company may be required to raise substantial additional capital over a period of several years in order to develop and commercialize its products 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs associated with developing and commercializing its products  broadening its direct marketing and sales force  maintaining existing or entering into future licensing and distribution agreements  protecting intellectual property rights  building its reagents and assay kits business  expanding facilities and consummating possible future acquisitions of technologies  products or businesses 
the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and investments  combined with cash to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
accordingly  the company may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  and public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to significantly reduce or refocus its operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its products  technologies or potential markets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to the company s existing stockholders 
impact of year the company has established a year program to address certain year issues 
this program focuses on four key areas of readiness internal infrastructure readiness  addressing internal hardware and software  including both information and non information technology systems  supplier readiness  addressing the preparedness of suppliers providing material incorporated into the company s products  product readiness  addressing product functionality  and customer readiness  addressing customer support and transactional activity 
for each readiness area  the company is systematically performing risk assessment  conducting testing  repairing year issues  developing contingency plans to mitigate unknown risks  and communicating year information to employees  suppliers  customers and other third parties 
internal infrastructure readiness 
the company has completed an assessment of its internal software applications and information technology hardware and has commenced work on testing and repairs 
readiness activities are intended to encompass all major categories of software applications in use by the company  including those used for manufacturing  engineering  sales  finance  and human resources  as well as hardware  including hubs  routers  telecommunication equipment  workstations and other items  and non information technology systems  including embedded systems  facilities and other operations  such as financial  banking  security and utility systems 
at december   approximately percent of the company s mission critical internal infrastructure has either been tested and determined to be year ready or is undergoing testing but is believed to be year ready based on representations by the supplier 
testing and repair activity is scheduled for completion by july  although the company has not yet found any significant mission critical software applications which require repair  any repairs that may yet be found to be required are expected to be completed by july  supplier readiness 
this area focuses on minimizing two components of risk associated with suppliers a supplier s product integrity  and a supplier s business capability to continue providing products and services 
the company has identified and contacted key suppliers regarding their relative risks in these two components 
to date  the company has received responses from approximately percent of its key suppliers  who indicate that the products provided to the company are year compliant 
in addition  the key suppliers have indicated they are in the process of developing or executing repair plans to address year issues which may affect their ability to continue providing products and services to the company 
the company s assessment of its key suppliers year readiness  and testing and repair of any year compliance issues  are scheduled to be completed by july  product readiness 
this area focuses on identifying and resolving year issues existing in the company s products 
this area encompasses a number of activities  including testing  evaluation  engineering and manufacturing implementation 
the company has completed a year readiness assessment for its current generation of released products based upon a series of industry recognized testing parameters and has determined that these products are year ready 
customer readiness 
this area focuses on customer readiness as it relates to ljl s responsibility to provide customer support  including retrofitting products as well as providing other services to the company s customers 
primarily due to the company s product readiness efforts regarding its current generation of released products  the company has completed its assessment of year risk in this area and has determined there are no issues to address 
summary 
if required  the company will formulate contingency plans by september   for those software applications  hardware and non information technology systems found to not be year ready 
it is not anticipated that contingency plans will be needed for the company s mission critical software applications  hardware and non information technology systems  nor does the company expect that contingency plans will be needed for its current generation of released products 
it is not known at this point if contingency plans will be needed for its key suppliers who have not yet responded to the company s request regarding their year readiness 
the company believes the overall cost to address year issues will not be material  however  since the company is continually testing and making necessary repairs  it may be necessary to reassess this estimate over time 
due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the year issue  the company cannot anticipate all of the possible problems that may occur 
adverse consequences from year issues may materially affect the company s warranty liability  the value of capitalized software applications  hardware and non information technology systems  the carrying value of its inventory  as well as the company s financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
year readiness problems could also subject the company to litigation which may include consequential damages 
additional factors that may affect future results the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  the company s actual results and could cause the company s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
new business strategy  new and undefined market for hts products in the second half of  the company implemented a new strategic business model to develop products for the hts market 
in connection with this change in strategy  the company shifted its focus from developing and manufacturing clinical diagnostic and research products on an original equipment manufacturing oem basis to developing  manufacturing and marketing products for the hts market 
as a result  the company s historical operating and financial performance is generally not indicative of future financial and business results 
the company incurred operating losses for the years ended december  and as a result of its change in business strategy and anticipates that it may continue to incur losses for at least the next several years  due to the substantial increases in expenditures necessary to develop and commercialize the company s hts products 
the company began commercial shipments of its first hts instrument  the analyst  in the second quarter of accordingly  the company is subject to the risks inherent in the operation of a new business  such as the failure to develop an effective sales  marketing and distribution channel  failure to achieve market acceptance and demand for its hts products  failure to implement commercial scale up of developed hts products and failure to attract and retain key personnel 
furthermore  the hts market is new and undefined  and the use of hts by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies is limited 
demand for the company s hts products will depend upon the extent to which pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies adopt hts as a drug discovery tool 
if hts does not become a widely used method in drug discovery  demand for the company s products will not develop as the company currently expects or at all 
the lack of demand for the company s hts products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
early stage of instrument development the company s success will depend on its ability to develop and commercialize its hts and ultra hts instruments 
the company began commercial shipments of its first hts instrument  the analyst  in the second quarter of the company had not previously developed or commercialized products for the hts market 
the successful implementation and operation of the company s hts products is a complex process requiring the integration of  among other technologies  advanced optics  electronics  robotics  microfluidics  fluorescence detector technologies and software and information systems 
even if analyst  acquest and the company s other hts products appear promising at commercial launch  they may not achieve market acceptance 
in addition  the company s hts or ultra hts instruments may be difficult or uneconomical to produce  fail to achieve expected performance levels  have a price level that is unacceptable in the industry or be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others or other competitive forces 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully manufacture and market the analyst  acquest or any of the company s other products on a timely basis  achieve anticipated performance levels or throughputs  gain industry acceptance of the company s products or develop a profitable business 
the failure to achieve any of these objectives would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with the development and commercialization of reagents and assay kits the company expects in the future that a substantial portion of its revenues may be derived from the sale of reagents and assay kits 
the company has limited experience in the development  manufacture and marketing of reagents or assay kits  only recently introducing its first reagents  tkx  in july the company intends to continue to license assay technologies from third parties and to develop reagents and assay kits internally 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in licensing any additional assay technologies on acceptable terms  if at all  or that it will successfully commercialize any reagents that it licenses 
in addition  the company is internally developing reagents and assay kits  but has limited experience in this area 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop additional reagents or assay kits internally or that any reagents or assay kits will achieve market acceptance 
as sales volumes increase  the company intends to outsource the manufacture of reagents and assays kits 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into agreements with third parties for the manufacture of reagents and assay kits on terms commercially favorable to the company or at all 
in addition  the company intends to sell reagents and assay kits to purchasers of hts and ultra hts instruments  including the analyst and acquest 
there can be no assurance that sales of the analyst and acquest will be sufficient to support this strategy 
a failure to achieve commercial acceptance of its reagents and assay kits would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products  rapid technological change the pharmaceutical and biotechnology instrumentation and reagents market is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its current and planned hts products and to develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new products that address the evolving needs of its customers including higher density  ultra high throughput analyzers and microplates  its fluorescence based reagents and assay kits  as well as products based on its flare technology 
the company anticipates that production units for these new products may not be available for several months or years  if at all 
the production of acquest and other analyzers and their associated microplates  fluorescence based reagents and assay kits may present development and manufacturing challenges 
the company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of its new products or its product enhancements 
any failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market demands or customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited sales and marketing experience the company has limited experience in direct marketing  sales or distribution 
the company s future profitability will depend on its ability to further develop a direct sales force to sell its hts products to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the company s products are technical in nature and the company therefore believes it is necessary to develop a direct sales force consisting of people with scientific backgrounds and expertise 
competition for such employees is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified salespeople or that the company will be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing organization 
failure to attract or retain qualified salespeople or to build such a sales and marketing organization would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to market its hts and ultra hts products in certain international markets through distributors 
other than japan  the company does not currently have distributors in any international markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to engage qualified distributors 
such distributors may fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to the company  fail to adequately market the company s products  cease operations with little or no notice to the company or offer  design  manufacture or promote competing product lines 
the failure to develop and maintain effective distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the market for hts products is highly competitive 
the company expects that competition will increase significantly as more biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies adopt hts instruments as a drug discovery tool and as new companies enter the market with advanced technologies and products 
the company competes in many areas  including hts instruments  assay development and reagent sales 
the company competes with companies which directly market hts products 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other research organizations are conducting research and developing products in various areas which compete with the company s technology platform  either on their own or in collaboration with others 
many of these competitors have greater financial  operational and sales and marketing resources  and more experience in research and development  than the company 
further  certain companies offer screening services on a contract or collaborative basis  and these services could eliminate the need for a potential customer to purchase the company s products 
the company s technological approaches may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of different approaches by one or more of the company s current or future competitors 
many of these competitors have greater financial and personnel resources  and more experience in research and development  sales and marketing and other areas than the company 
concentration of hts and ultra hts market the market for hts and ultra hts products is highly concentrated  with approximately large pharmaceutical companies operating a substantial portion of the company s targeted drug discovery laboratories 
accordingly  the company expects a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the company faces risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base as it sells its hts products  including the failure to establish or maintain relationships within a limited customer pool  or substantial financial difficulties or decreased capital spending by its customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
lengthy sales cycles the sale of hts and ultra hts products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by customers 
accordingly  the sales cycle associated with the company s products is expected to be lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  that are beyond the company s control 
due to this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  the company s operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
manufacturing risk the company is only producing analyst and acquest in limited quantities  and has not yet manufactured other products in significant quantities 
the company may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of its hts products due to  among other things  quality control and assurance  component supply and availability of qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that  even if successfully developed and introduced to market  any of the company s products can be manufactured in sufficient quantities while meeting quality control standards or at acceptable cost 
difficulties encountered by the company in the manufacturing scale up of analyst  acquest and other hts products could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth the company s success will depend on the expansion of its operations and the effective management of growth  which will place a significant strain on the company s management  operational and financial resources 
to manage such growth  the company must expand its facilities  augment its operational  financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
the company s failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel  need to hire additional qualified personnel the company s success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management  technical  and scientific personnel  including lev j 
leytes  the company s chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
in addition  the company s success will depend on its ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the process of hiring such qualified personnel is often lengthy 
there can be no assurance that the company can recruit such personnel on a timely basis  if at all 
the company s management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on suppliers and contract manufacturers certain components used in the company s hts products are currently purchased from a single or a limited number of outside sources 
the reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in time delays associated with redesigning a product due to a failure to obtain a single source component  an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery 
the company does not maintain long term agreements with any of its suppliers  and therefore the supply of a particular component could be terminated at any time without penalty to the supplier 
any interruption in the supply of single source components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to rely on contract manufacturers  some of which may be single source vendors  for the development  manufacture and supply of certain of its reagents and assay kits 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to enter into such manufacturing contracts on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that the company s current or future contract manufacturers will meet the company s requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness 
if the supply of any such components  reagents or assay kits is interrupted  components  reagents and assay kits from alternative suppliers and contract manufacturers may not be available in sufficient volumes within required timeframes  if at all  to meet the company s production needs 
accumulated deficit  uncertainty of future profitability as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company s expansion of its operations and continued development of its hts products will require a substantial increase in sales  marketing and research and development expenditures for at least the next several years 
as a result  the company expects to incur operating losses for the next several years 
the company s profitability will depend on its ability to successfully develop and commercialize its hts products 
accordingly  the extent of future losses and the time required to achieve profitability  if achieved at all  is highly uncertain 
moreover  if profitability is achieved  the level of such profitability cannot be predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the company may be required to raise substantial additional capital over a period of several years in order to develop and commercialize its products 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs associated with developing and commercializing its products  developing a direct marketing and sales force  maintaining existing  or entering into future  licensing and distribution agreements  protecting intellectual property rights  entering the reagents and assay kits business  expanding facilities and consummating possible future acquisitions of technologies  products or businesses 
the company may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
accordingly  the company may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  and public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to significantly reduce or refocus its operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its products  technologies or potential markets  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to the company s existing stockholders 
risk of international sales and operations the company expects that international sales will account for a significant portion of the company s total revenues in the future 
international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks  including the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability or conflicts  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in establishing or managing distributor relationships and general economic conditions 
in addition  as the company expands its international operations  it may be required to invoice its sales in local currencies 
consequently  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses the company may acquire certain technologies  products or businesses to broaden the scope of its existing and planned product lines and technologies 
such acquisitions would expose the company to the risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies  operations  sites and personnel  the diversion of resources from the company s existing business and technologies  the inability to generate revenues to offset associated acquisition costs  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  and procedures and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
acquisitions may also result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence or assumption of debt or additional expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets or potential businesses 
the company s failure to successfully address such risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property risks the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the company holds four us patents 
the company has ten pending us patent applications  five international patent applications and twenty provisional us patent applications 
to supplement its proprietary technology  the company has licensed ten patents and one patent application from fluorrx pursuant to a june agreement  as amended 
in october  the company exercised its option under this agreement on three more patent applications 
under this license  the company obtained certain worldwide rights relating to fluorrx s flare technology 
certain of these rights have been licensed on an exclusive basis 
certain other rights have been licensed on a non exclusive basis  and therefore could be or are licensed to third parties 
in accordance with such agreement  the company paid one time fees as well as agreeing to pay royalties based on sales of its products that incorporate this technology 
the license may be terminated in the event of a material breach by the company 
furthermore  fluorrx may elect to convert the exclusive rights into non exclusive rights in the event the company fails to make certain minimum royalty payments 
if fluorrx were to terminate the license due to a material breach of the license by the company  the company would lose the right to incorporate flare technology into its hts products 
in such event  the company would be required to exclude flare technology from the company s existing and future products and either license or internally develop alternative technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to license alternative technologies on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that the company would be capable of internally developing such technologies 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that other companies may not independently develop technology with functionality similar or superior to the flare technology that does not or is claimed not to infringe the flare patents or that otherwise circumvents the technology licensed to the company 
the company is aware of third party patents that contain issued claims that may cover certain aspects of the company s reagent technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to license any such patents to produce certain reagents  assay kits and related products or that such licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any action against the company claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected technologies could subject the company to potential liability for damages 
the company could incur substantial costs in defending patent infringement claims  obtaining patent licenses  engaging in interference and opposition proceedings or other challenges to its patent rights or intellectual property rights made by third parties  or in bringing such proceedings or enforcing any patent rights against third parties 
the company s inability to obtain necessary licenses or its involvement in proceedings concerning patent rights could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the patent positions of bioanalytical product companies  including the company  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
in addition  the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the patent applications of the company or its licensor will result in patents being issued or that any issued patents will provide protection against competitive technologies or will be held valid if challenged or circumvented 
others may independently develop products similar to those of the company or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to the company 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each of such patents or to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
if the company does not obtain the necessary licenses  it could be subject to litigation and encounter delays in product introductions while it attempts to design around such patents 
alternatively  the development  manufacture or sale of such products could be prevented 
litigation would result in significant costs to the company as well as diversion of management time 
adverse determinations in any such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also relies on trade secret and copyright law  and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property rights in its products and technology 
there can be no assurance that these agreements and measures will provide meaningful protection of the company s trade secrets  copyrights  know how  or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies 
litigation to protect the company s trade secrets or copyrights would result in significant costs to the company as well as diversion of management time 
adverse determinations in any such proceedings or unauthorized disclosure of the company s trade secrets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its intellectual property in these markets 
government regulation while the company believes that none of the company s hts and ultra hts products will be regulated as medical devices or otherwise subject to fda regulation  the company s clinical diagnostics products  including the luminometer  q  horizon and a microplate heater  are subject to fda regulation as medical devices  as well as similar foreign regulation 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances and approvals and otherwise remaining in regulatory compliance in the united states and certain other countries is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
although the company has phased out production of the luminometer  q and the microplate heater  the company may continue to manufacture the horizon on an oem basis during and possibly beyond 
the horizon is used in research and clinical laboratories to perform in vitro diagnostic ivd tests  which are exempt from investigational device exemption ide requirements  including the need to obtain the fda s prior approval  provided that  among other things  the testing is noninvasive  the product is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established test or procedure  and distribution controls are established to assure that ivds distributed for research are used only for those purposes 
to the company s knowledge  its oem customers have met these conditions 
there can be no assurance that the fda would agree that the oem customers distribution of the company s clinical diagnostic products meet and have met the requirements for ide exemption 
failure by the company  its oem customers or the recipients of the company s clinical diagnostic products to comply with the ide exemption requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda  which could adversely affect the company s or its oem customers ability to gain marketing clearance or approval of these products or could result in the recall of previously distributed products 
applicable law requires that the company comply with the fda s current gmp regulations for the manufacture of the horizon 
the fda monitors compliance with its gmp regulations by subjecting medical product manufacturers to periodic fda inspections of their manufacturing facilities 
the fda has recently revised the gmp regulations 
the new quality system regulation imposes design controls and makes other significant changes in the requirements applicable to manufacturers 
the company is also subject to other regulatory requirements  and may need to submit reports to the fda including adverse event reporting 
failure to comply with gmp regulations or other applicable legal requirements can lead to  among other things  warning letters  seizure of violative products  suspension of manufacturing  government injunctions and potential civil or criminal liability on the part of the company and the responsible officers and employees 
in addition  the government may halt or restrict continued sale of such instruments 
any such actions could have a material  adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
in order to export its clinical diagnostics instruments  the company maintains international organization for standardization iso certification and applies the ce mark to certain products that are exported  which subjects the company s operations to periodic surveillance audits 
while the company believes it is currently in compliance with gmp regulations and iso standards  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will be found to comply with gmp regulations  iso standards or other applicable legal requirements in the future or that the company will not be required to incur substantial costs to maintain its compliance with existing or future manufacturing regulations  standards or other requirements 
any such noncompliance or increased cost of compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  storage  use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
any material failure to comply with such laws could require the company to incur significant costs and would have a material  adverse effect upon the company s ability to do business 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies relating to government regulations could materially and adversely affect the ability of the company to comply with such requirements 
hazardous materials the company s research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous materials  biological samples  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
in the future  the company plans to manufacture certain reagents  some of which likely will contain hazardous materials including carcinogens 
the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the storage  use  and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use of these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  the company could be held liable for damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations if the company develops its own commercial reagents manufacturing facility 
impact of year the company has established a year program to address certain year issues 
this program focuses on four key areas of readiness internal infrastructure readiness  addressing internal hardware and software  including both information and non information technology systems  supplier readiness  addressing the preparedness of suppliers providing material incorporated into the company s products  product readiness  addressing product functionality  and customer readiness  addressing customer support and transactional activity 
for each readiness area  the company is systematically performing risk assessment  conducting testing  repairing year issues  developing contingency plans to mitigate unknown risks  and communicating year information to employees  suppliers  customers and other third parties 
internal infrastructure readiness 
the company has completed an assessment of its internal software applications and information technology hardware and has commenced work on testing and repairs 
readiness activities are intended to encompass all major categories of software applications in use by the company  including those used for manufacturing  engineering  sales  finance  and human resources  as well as hardware  including hubs  routers  telecommunication equipment  workstations and other items  and non information technology systems  including embedded systems  facilities and other operations  such as financial  banking  security and utility systems 
at december   approximately percent of the company s mission critical internal infrastructure has either been tested and determined to be year ready or is undergoing testing but is believed to be year ready based on representations by the supplier 
testing and repair activity is scheduled for completion by july  although the company has not yet found any significant mission critical software applications which require repair  any repairs that may yet be found to be required are expected to be completed by july  supplier readiness 
this area focuses on minimizing two components of risk associated with suppliers a supplier s product integrity  and a supplier s business capability to continue providing products and services 
the company has identified and contacted key suppliers regarding their relative risks in these two components 
to date  the company has received responses from approximately percent of its key suppliers  who indicate that the products provided to the company are year compliant 
in addition  the key suppliers have indicated they are in the process of developing or executing repair plans  if needed  to address year issues which may affect their ability to continue providing products and services to the company 
the company s assessment of its key suppliers year readiness  and testing and repair of any year compliance issues  are scheduled to be completed by july  product readiness 
this area focuses on identifying and resolving year issues existing in the company s products 
this area encompasses a number of activities  including testing  evaluation  engineering and manufacturing implementation 
the company has completed a year readiness assessment for its current generation of released products based upon a series of industry recognized testing parameters and has determined that these products are year ready 
customer readiness 
this area focuses on customer readiness as it relates to ljl s responsibility to provide customer support  including retrofitting products as well as providing other services to the company s customers 
primarily due to the company s product readiness efforts regarding its current generation of released products  the company has completed its assessment of year risk in this area and has determined there are no issues to address 
summary 
if required  the company will formulate contingency plans by september   for those software applications  hardware and non information technology systems found to not be year ready 
it is not anticipated that contingency plans will be needed for the company s mission critical software applications  hardware and non information technology systems  nor does the company expect that contingency plans will be needed for its current generation of released products 
it is not known at this point if contingency plans will be needed for key suppliers 
the company believes the overall cost to address year issues will not be material  however  since the company is continually testing and making necessary repairs  it may be necessary to reassess this estimate over time 
due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the year issue  the company cannot anticipate all of the possible problems that may occur 
adverse consequences from year issues may materially affect the company s warranty liability  the value of capitalized software applications  hardware and non information technology systems  the carrying value of its inventory  as well as the company s financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
year readiness problems could also subject the company to litigation which may include consequential damages 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between each of their existing sovereign currencies and the single european currency euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date  with a transition period through january  regarding certain elements of the euro change 
the company does not expect the transition to  or use of  the euro to materially or adversely affect its business  financial condition or results of operation 
future fluctuations in operating results the company s future operating results are likely to fluctuate substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the degree of fluctuation will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and level of sales  the mix of products sold through direct sales channels and third party distributors  and any change in the product mix among the company s existing and planned product lines 
such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because a significant portion of the company s business is expected to be derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  variations in the timing of such orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s operating results 
other factors that may result in fluctuations in operating results include industry acceptance of hts and ultra hts as a drug discovery tool  market acceptance of the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and the introduction of new products and new technologies by the company or its competitors  delays in research and development of new products  increased research and development expenses  increased marketing and sales expenses associated with the implementation of the company s direct marketing efforts  availability and cost of component parts from its suppliers  competitive pricing pressures  and developments with respect to regulatory matters 
in connection with future introductions of new products  the company may be required to establish or increase reserves or record charges for inventory obsolescence in connection with unsold inventory  if any  of older generations of products 
the company s expenditures for research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative functions are based in part on future revenue projections 
the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated declines in revenues  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be required to reduce prices in response to competitive pressures or other factors or increase spending to pursue new market opportunities 
any decline in the average selling price of a product which is not offset by a reduction in product costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins would decrease the company s overall gross profit and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s operating results may vary from the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and  as a result  the price of the common stock would be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
ljl is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
ljl s strategy to reduce investment risk is to primarily invest its marketable securities in short term marketable securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
the remainder of the company s marketable securities portfolio is invested in marketable securities with maturity dates of eighteen months or less 
the company diversifies its marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company has a wholly owned uk subsidiary  which exposes the company to foreign currency exchange risk 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  the company s uk subsidiary uses the us dollar as its functional currency  however  its uk subsidiary does bill its customers in the currency of the customer s country 
foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the end of period exchange rates except for property and equipment  which is translated at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during each period 
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income loss and were not material 
the company has not entered into any currency hedging activities
