in this report the words expects  anticipates  believes  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as to the date hereof 
the company s sales of million were lower than sales of million because of discontinued product lines at uniflow and lower sales at the tooling group 
the net loss from continuing operations was million  or per share  compared to a loss from continuing operations in of  or one cent per share 
the increase in the loss was due primarily to increasing operating losses at uniflow  which included certain restructuring charges 
during  management focused its efforts on curtailing the losses stemming from the milford and uniflow units 
management s plan was twofold to discontinue milford and restructure uniflow s operations 
milford s primary operations were sold mid year  while its starter motor machining line was sold after the september  year end 
uniflow s restructuring steps involved a series of major plant and equipment consolidation moves  which adversely affected productivity throughout the year 
the uniflow restructuring is still in process subsequent to the fiscal year end  with the primary focus on repricing parts to acceptable profit margin levels 
although the full impact of the parts repricing will not be known for a period of months  it appears that this effort has significantly narrowed uniflow s operating losses based on operating results for october  november and december the tooling operations recorded lower operating income compared to the prior year due to a slowdown of orders and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of micanol into l h see segment review below 
the company s cash flow from operations combined with cash generated from the sales of the milford and uniflow assets was sufficient to fund operations through the end of the fiscal year  including the timely payment of all scheduled debt obligations 
nevertheless  cash flow from operations was not sufficient to maintain compliance with certain bank covenants 
the company is working with its secured lenders closely and has continued to make all scheduled debt payments through december in november  the company entered into an amendment and extension agreement with its primary lender  which provides financing through february  management believes that its cash flow outlook for has improved substantially with the culmination of certain events during and after fiscal  as described above 
management believes it can extend current debt facilities with existing lenders or refinance with other lenders on a continuing basis 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and amounts available on its line of credit will be sufficient to fund continuing operations and debt service through fiscal while management is committed to continuing its efforts to improve operating results in the normal course of business over the long term  it nevertheless also retained the investment banking firm of goldsmith  agio  helms securities  inc in november to assist it in evaluating the prospects of selling all or a portion of the company or its assets or effectuating a merger or partnership with another company 
although the company will consider any meaningful offer on favorable terms in order to maximize shareholder value  the company still considers continuing as an independent profitable entity as a viable alternative 
results of operations by segment metal parts forming segment chart of three year comparative operating results in thousands amount amount amount net sales    gross profit differential   operating expenses    operating loss   before interest  bad debt and corporate overhead expense 
the metal parts forming segment is comprised of the company s uniflow subsidiary 
uniflow currently manufactures suspension ball joint housings  truck wheel fasteners  transmission shaft parts and a variety of oem cold formed and forged parts 
customers are primarily automotive and trucking related original equipment manufacturers oem and service part manufacturers after market 
in net sales decreased from and increased in from the sales decrease in from primarily reflects the discontinuation of various parts offerings  including airbag housings and various cold headed parts 
uniflow s existing business of suspension housings  transmission shafts  wheel studs and starter motor shafts increased in over as significant increases in transmission shafts and starter motor shafts were offset by lower sales of wheel studs 
management is continuing to review all of its sales with the objective of retaining only profitable product lines 
this review includes uniflow s dedicated production effort for the manufacture of certain transmission shafts for an automotive oem customer 
sales in for these parts totaled approximately million 
in and the company invested over million in new equipment for this project based on certain commitments made by the customer 
uniflow and the customer are currently negotiating a strategy to either continue with production of these parts at price levels mutually acceptable  or reach other terms for the company to recoup its investment 
gross profit differential on sales was in  in  and in in  the gross profit was adversely impacted largely due to a major restructuring effort 
this endeavor required significant resources for the consolidation of production into two facilities from three  which resulted in higher labor and factory support costs during most of in addition   of costs related to the restructuring plan were recorded in  principally for discontinuing certain product lines and allowing for certain plant consolidation costs 
subsequent to year end the company negotiated significant price increases on suspension housings and wheel studs  which management believes will substantially improve uniflow s gross profit 
operating expense as a percentage of sales was in  in  and in the percentage increase in compared to was largely due to restructuring charges recorded mid year 
those charges totalling million  primarily from the writedown of goodwill and machinery  were offset by the  gain realized from the sale of its fx cold former machine  for a net restructuring charge of million 
without the restructuring charges  operating expense in decreased compared to  due to lower personnel and professional expenses  while expense was lower than due primarily to lower personnel and sales related expense 
in  uniflow s loss from operations was million  or of sales  compared to a loss of million  or of sales in  while in the net loss was  or of sales 
the increase in loss in from is the result of the restructuring charges and related reductions in production efficiency realized during the plant consolidation period 
the increase in loss in from was the result of increased factory costs associated with developing new jobs for production which contributed to lower production efficiency on uniflow s traditional business

the tooling segment is comprised of the form flow  l h and micanol units 
the tooling operations manufacture and sell customized tools and dies for use in the production of hot and cold formed metal parts 
net sales decreased in by compared to  while increasing by in over the sales decrease in was primarily the result of lower sales from the micanol unit  which recorded lower sales orders from a few of its larger accounts 
form flow also recorded lower sales  while l h s sales were flat 
gross profit on sales was in  in  and in the gross profit percentage decreased principally because of the lower sales volume and the consolidation expenses and lower production efficiencies resulting from moving micanol s operation to the l h facility 
the improvement in s gross profit over was principally due to management s focus on controlling shop floor labor and related support expense 
operating expense as a percentage of sales has remained steady for the periods shown  and was in  in  and in the tooling segment s operating profit was million in  or of sales  million  or of sales in  and million  or of sales in the decrease in operating profit primarily results from the lower sales volume  along with the micanol consolidation expense 
the increase in operating profit in over primarily reflects the improved gross profit on sales 
discontinued operations production machining segment during the second quarter of fiscal the company decided to discontinue its milford operation due to ongoing adverse operating results 
in this segment recorded an operating loss of  prior to the decision to discontinue  compared to operating income of  in the decline in operating results in from was attributable primarily to lower product pricing  dictated by milford s primary customer  and lower production efficiencies caused largely by new manufacturing projects that strained existing resources 
in  the company recognized a million disposal gain on the sale of milford s assets and business in transactions involving milford s two primary customers 
corporate expenses unallocated corporate overhead was million in  compared to  in  and  in the increase in primarily reflects expense associated with the company s newly operational computer information systems  higher personnel costs and higher professional fees associated with the disposal of various operating assets 
the increase in expense reflects additional administrative and personnel expense  primarily related to the establishment of new corporate wide computer systems  higher amortization related to the debt financing completed mid and higher professional fee expense 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense was  in  million in  and  in the decrease in interest expense in compared to resulted from a reduction of secured debt related to various asset sales for cash 
in  interest was higher than principally due to higher term debt to finance equipment purchases and higher line of credit borrowings used for working capital 
income tax benefit expense was  in   in  and  in the higher income tax benefit reflects the substantial net loss 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital position was a negative million at september   a positive million at september  and million at september  the negative working capital position largely resulted from the classification of long term obligations to current  as the company was in default of certain bank covenants as of september  management believes that it will be able to refinance this debt on a continuing basis in the coming months 
the increase in working capital in compared to was attributable to the addition of the milford operation  while in working capital increased from primarily from a major refinancing of long term debt 
management believes that internally generated cash from operations and amounts available on the bank line of credit will be sufficient to cover scheduled debt payments during fiscal as well as fund continuing working capital requirements 
the company expects to improve its liquidity and reduce outstanding debt by selling noncore assets

working capital items provided million  as accounts receivable collections increased  while inventories were lowered due to better inventory management 
discontinued operations provided million derived from the sale of the milford assets 
in  cash flow from operations before working capital items and discontinued operations was  compared to million in this decline is attributable to the decline in operating income from the metal parts forming and tooling segments 
in  of the million in cash flow from operating activities  working capital items and discontinued operations used million 
working capital items used million  primarily related to higher receivables inventories because of the increasing sales  partially offset by  provided by discontinued operations
