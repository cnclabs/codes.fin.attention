as a percentage of revenues  preopening cost amortization was for both fiscal and through january   the company deferred its restaurant preopening costs and amortized them over the twelve month period following the opening of each respective complex 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued a statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires entities to expense  as incurred  all start up and preopening costs that are not otherwise capitalizable as long lived assets 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier adoption is encouraged 
restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted by sop  and entities are not required to report the pro forma effects of the retroactive application of the new accounting standard 
the company s adoption of the expense as incurred accounting principle required by sop will involve the recognition of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle required by sop as a one time charge against earnings  net of any related income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal in the amount of  or 
per diluted share 
as has been the case with the company s current method of deferring preopening costs  preopening expense comparisons under the new expense as incurred standard will continue to vary from period to period  depending on the number and timing of complex openings and the specific preopening expenses incurred for each complex during each period being compared 
based on the company s current expansion plans  the company believes total preopening expenses for fiscal under either accounting principle deferred or expense as incurred will likely exceed the respective amount for each immediate prior year 
however  the new expense as incurred accounting principle required by sop will  by definition  cause an accelerated recognition of preopening expenses 
the impact of this accelerated recognition on the company s results of operations for any given period could be significant  depending on the number of complexes opened during that period

the facility  which matures in may  has certain financial covenants including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level  a maximum leverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage  and maximum level of capital expenditures on new stores 
at january    was available under this facility 
the company has entered into an agreement that expires in  to fix its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at january  on notional amounts aggregating  the market risks associated with the agreements are mitigated because increased interest payments under the agreement resulting from a decrease in libor are effectively offset by decreased payments under the debt obligation

quarterly fluctuations  seasonality  and inflation as a result of the substantial revenues associated with each new complex  the timing of new complex openings will result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company expects seasonality to be a factor in the operation or results of its business in the future due to expected lower third quarter revenues due to the fall season  and expects higher fourth quarter revenues associated with the year end holidays 
the effects of supplier price increases have not been material 
the company believes low inflation rates in its market areas have contributed to stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there is no assurance that low inflation rates will continue or that the federal minimum wage rate will not increase 
impact of the year issue the year issues arose because many computer systems and software applications as well as embedded computer chips in equipment currently in use were constructed using an abbreviated date field that eliminates the first two digits of the year 
on january   these systems  applications and embedded computer chips may incorrectly recognize the date as january  accordingly  many computer systems and software applications  as well as embedded computer chips  may incorrectly process financial and operating information or fail to process such information completely 
the company recognized this problem and is addressing its potential effects on its computer systems  software applications and equipment 
in december  the company established a year initiative managed by a team of internal staff that is being headed by an officer of the company 
the mission of the initiative is to ensure that all critical systems  facilities  and processes are identified  analyzed for year compliance  corrected if necessary  and tested if changes are necessary 
the company has a year strategy in place and has begun the implementation of the year plan to manage and minimize risks associated with the year issues 
the company has contracted with an independent consulting firm who specializes in such matters to assess the risks posed for the company by the year issues  including an assessment of its risks in every area involving the use of computer technology and an assessment of the business and legal risks created for the company by the year issues 
with respect to information technology it systems  the company has conducted an inventory of and is evaluating and reviewing its application software on all platforms such as the local area network and personal computers 
concerning non it systems  including embedded technology  the company has conducted an inventory of and is reviewing and evaluating all of its telecommunications  security access and building central systems 
the company s year plan includes specific timetables for the following categories of tasks with respect to both it systems and embedded technology as follows identification of year issues substantially completed prioritization of year issues substantially completed estimation of total year related costs  implementation of year solutions in process and to be completed by august  testing of year solutions in process and to be completed by may  monitoring of all systems for changes in current systems that would require changes in year plan in process and to be completed by september  development of year contingency plans in process and to be completed by june  final year tests to be conducted starting september  the company has contacted vendors who provide mission critical goods and services to submit to the company their compliance plans and to certify compliance in order continue to do business with the company 
as of january   the company had incurred  in software costs  fees and expenses in connection with its year efforts 
the company currently expects to spend  directly on year efforts by january  the company believes its most significant worst case year scenarios are interference with its point of sale system and its inability to operate its amusement games 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company is developing a contingency plan to continue operations through manual intervention and other procedures should it become necessary to do so 
despite the company s efforts  there can be no assurance that all material risks associated with year issues relating to systems within its control will have been adequately identified and corrected before the end of however as the result of its year plan and the replacement of the accounting and financial reporting system in and the human resource and payroll systems in  the company does not believe that in the aggregate year issues with respect to both its own it and non it systems will be material to its business  operations or financial condition

the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest expense from variable rate debt 
if interest rates increased from the floating rates as of january   interest expense for the year ended january  would increase by approximately this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical rates on the company s variable rate debt as of january   adjusted for known cash commitments during
