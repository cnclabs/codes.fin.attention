because of the integration of the operations of up up and ahp  the company is not able to quantify the portion of the overall increase in expenses attributable to each of the components 
depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of goodwill of ahp and other intangible assets and the depreciation of investments made to achieve the consolidation of the up up and ahp operations and to enhance the information technology infrastructure in order to allow for future growth and capabilities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased by million  from million in to million in provider network revenues increased by million  from million in to million in of this increase  million was attributable to the addition of new payor clients  the growth in the overall claims volume from existing payor clients and the expansion of the company s provider network

depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation expense and amortization of goodwill of nhs and ahp  as well as depreciation on increased capital expenditures to accommodate growth 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   the company had working capital of approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million in to million in in december  the company utilized the proceeds from a million line of credit with a bank as part of the consideration paid for the acquisition of proamerica 
in february  the company entered into a five year million term loan with the same bank and utilized the proceeds from the term loan to replenish the amount drawn under the line of credit 
the company s primary capital resources commitment is to fund advances to contracting providers upon exercise of prepayment options granted to contracting providers 
depending on increases in claims volume and in the number of payor clients and contracting provider hospitals electing to accept the prepayment option  the company estimates that million to million could be required to fund the prepayment options during in  the board of directors of the company approved a common stock repurchase program of up to million 
the company canceled the common stock repurchase program as of february  as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock under the program  at an aggregate purchase price of million  and reissued  of the shares for an aggregate consideration of million 
the company believes that its existing liquidity sources  anticipated funds from operations  and credit arrangements will satisfy cash requirements for its operations for the next twenty four months 
however  in the event of additional acquisitions and or in the event that the advances for prepayment options exceed the company s currently anticipated estimates and or other available sources of liquidity to fund such payments are not as great as anticipated  or in the event that  if acquired the bank requires funding to maintain its capital requirements or to expand its business  the company could be required to borrow additional funds or issue additional equity securities to fund the balance of such advances 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to effect any such additional borrowings or issue additional equity securities on acceptable terms 
interest rate sensitivity the company is subject to interest rate risk on its short term investments portfolio and its outstanding bank loans 
the company has determined that a move in the current weighted average interest rates of its short term investments and its outstanding bank loans would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
impact of inflation since the company s revenues are based on medical costs  the impact of inflation on operating costs and expenses should be offset by the impact of inflation of medical costs 
certain factors that may affect future operating results or stock prices a significant portion of up up s revenues are derived from a small number of payor clients 
in  three payor clients accounted for approximately of revenues 
the loss of a contract with a major payor client and the inability to replace any such client with significant new clients could have a material adverse effect on up up 
up up s contracts with its payor clients for access to the provider network generally permits the annual renegotiation of terms and permits either party to terminate the contract at any time upon satisfaction of notice requirements 
also  those contracts do not prohibit payor clients from entering into contracts with or utilizing other provider networks or developing their own provider networks 
therefore  even if a payor client does not terminate its contract with up up  up up could experience a decrease in claims from that payor client as a result of the use of their own provider networks  other provider networks  or other managed care systems 
up up s contract with the state of kentucky is terminable for the convenience of the government 
furthermore  the health insurance industry has been experiencing significant consolidation  particularly consolidation designed to promote an increase in managed health care insurance programs  as opposed to the indemnity style programs for which the up up provider network is most attractive 
up up believes these consolidation trends have in the past reduced utilization of the up up provider network by particular health insurance programs  and  in the future  could further reduce utilization of the up up provider network  as a result of both a decrease in the number of payor clients and a decrease in the need for payor clients to utilize the up up provider network 
year readiness disclosure the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer and software systems regarding the year the company  like other organizations  is in the process of assessing and modifying or replacing its information technology and non information technology to ensure  to the extent within the control of the company  their functionality with respect to the year millennium change and to identify and evaluate potential risks to the company to the extent that year problems not within the company s control could impact the company 
the company s primary computer systems operate from an ibm platform and were designed in the s  generally with four digit year capability 
with respect to non information technology  all of the company s facilities are relatively modern  post  and are believed  based on the evaluation to date  not to have any significant year problems 
the company has budgeted million  as a conservative estimate of the maximum cost to it  to address year problems  and has presently spent approximately  the company anticipates that it will be year compliant by july  and will spend the remainder of testing 
while there can be no guarantee  the company believes that year issues with respect to both the information technology and non information technology systems within its control will be adequately addressed by it and will not cause material disruption to the company s operations 
the company intends to monitor its progress towards addressing its year issues successfully and intends to develop contingency plans if necessary 
however  the company s operations are dependent to a substantial extent on the ability of its payor clients  and to a lesser extent  possibly its contracting providers  to address successfully their year issues in connection with their claims processing 
the company has no guarantee  however  that its payor clients or contracting providers will be able to resolve all of their own year problems in a timely manner 
the company has had discussions with its major payor clients and the company believes  based on the discussions and other information available to it  that all of its major payor clients are aware of the year issue and are expending significant resources to identify and resolve all of their year problems 
the company could be materially and adversely affected as a result of year problems incurred by payor clients or contracting providers or their inability to interface with the company s systems  or as a result of unforeseen problems regarding the company s own system 
the company intends to continue to monitor to the best of its ability the likelihood of significant problems experienced by such entities which could materially affect the company or its operations 
dependence on contracting providers up up s growth depends on its ability to retain existing contracting providers  to attract additional contracting providers  and to retain or improve the price concessions granted by contracting providers 
the termination of a significant number of contracts with contracting providers having a high volume of claims with up up s payor clients  the inability to replace those contracts with similar contracting providers and or the renegotiation of contracts resulting in reduced price concessions could have a material adverse effect on up up 
up up s contracts with contracting providers typically have a one year term  renewable automatically for successive one year terms unless either party gives notice of intent not to renew  and may be terminated at any time  for any reason  upon satisfaction of the notification requirements 
also the contracts do not prohibit the contracting providers from entering into discounted arrangements with others 
possibility of changes in industry practices and government regulation adverse to up up up up s business is dependent in significant part on its ability to enter into contracts with payors and providers on terms attractive to all parties and the absence of substantial changes in the health care industry that would decrease the need for the services offered by it 
up up s ability to continue conducting business in its current manner could be seriously jeopardized if  among other things  a significant number of payors  such as insurance companies  were to seek price concessions directly from providers 
in addition  up up s opportunities to maintain or expand its existing operations could be limited by substantial changes in the health care industry  such as further adoption of capitation payment systems  which have become more prevalent in recent years  or the enactment of legislation or the adoption of regulations unfavorable to up up and or its relationships with payors or providers 
any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on up up and could cause it to alter substantially its business objectives and methods of operation 
during the past several years  the united states health care industry has been subject to changing and increasing government regulation 
a number of proposals for health care reform have been made at the federal and state levels  including proposals to provide greater government control of health care spending  to reduce fraud and abuse  to broaden access to health care services and to change the operating environment for health care providers and payors 
up up cannot predict what impact  if any  these activities  which include efforts to effect reform through legislation and changes in the administration or interpretation of government health care programs  laws  regulations or policies  might have on it 
any of these activities could have a material adverse effect on up up 
risks related to growth up up s strategy is to continue to grow aggressively  both internally and through acquisitions 
since its initial public offering in july  up up has made three acquisitions  most recently the proamerica acquisition in december this strategy is likely to place significant demands on up up s financial  operational and management resources  and to expose it to a variety of risks  including the risk that up up will be unable to attract and retain the personnel or obtain the financial and other resources necessary to pursue and manage its growth 
up up s growth makes for greater demands on the time and attention of its key personnel 
expenses arising from up up s efforts to complete acquisitions  develop new products or increase its existing market penetration could have an material adverse effect on it 
furthermore  up up may not be able to identify  acquire or integrate acquisition candidates successfully or manage profitably any additional products and services resulting from acquisitions 
acquired businesses  products and services may not contribute to up up s overall strategy or produce returns that justify the related investment or implementation by up up 
in addition  up up may acquire companies or seek to develop products or services in areas in which it does not currently operate or have meaningful experience 
for example  up up has recently entered into an agreement to acquire a federal savings bank 
these acquisitions or developments may require up up s management to develop expertise in new areas and to attract a new customer base and could have a material adverse effect on up up 
up up may not be able to implement its growth strategy successfully or  if successful in consummating acquisitions  be able to manage its expanded operations effectively and profitably 
risks of integrating acquired operations up up must successfully combine and integrate the operations of acquired entities in order to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
integrating management services  administrative organizations  facilities  management information systems and other operational aspects of acquired businesses  products or services can be time consuming and costly and may distract management from day to day operations 
challenges in coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures could magnify integration problems 
up up cannot guarantee that its integration processes will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of any past or future acquisitions will be realized 
furthermore  up up may experience substantial unanticipated costs or liabilities or other material adverse effects associated with past or future acquisitions and integration activities conducted by it 
substantial competition the market for up up s services is highly competitive 
up up competes or may in the future have to compete for clients with national  regional and local provider networks  managed care organizations and health care information companies 
several of up up s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than up up  which could put up up at a significant competitive disadvantage 
up up may not be able to compete effectively with any of these parties in attracting and retaining clients 
exposure to professional liability up up  through its subsidiary  national health services  applies medical treatment guidelines in its utilization review and case management services 
as a result  national health services could become subject to claims related to adverse medical consequences as a result of  or for the costs of  services denied  and claims  such as malpractice  arising from the errors or omissions of health care professionals 
a successful claim against up up or a subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on it 
furthermore  up up may incur substantial costs in defending against claims  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome 
procedures implemented by up up may not limit its liability or be effective  and litigation to which up up is or may become subject could have a material adverse effect on it 
up up maintains insurance coverage that it believes is reasonable in light of its experience to date 
however  this insurance may be insufficient to protect up up from liability and may not continue to be available to it at reasonable cost or at all 
significant uncertainty regarding possible future sales of significant blocks of up up common stock  possible effect on the trading market for up up common stock and the control of up up thomas l 
blair  chairman of the board and chief executive officer of up up beneficially owns an aggregate of  shares  or approximately of up up s common stock 
this beneficial ownership includes  shares  or approximately of outstanding shares  which mr 
blair has committed to purchase on or prior to february  these  shares currently are held by independent divestment trust  which acquired them from principal mutual holding company 
in addition  capital z financial services fund ii  lp recently purchased  shares from officers and employees of up up and an option to purchase from mr 
blair an additional  shares of common stock on or prior to february  effect on trading market for up up common stock 
if the  shares of up up common stock are not purchased by february  by mr 
blair  as he is obligated to do  those shares would have to be sold by the trust in which they have been placed 
further  mr 
blair likely would seek to sell shares to pay the purchase price of at least some of the shares he purchases from the trust 
also  capital z financial services fund ii could seek to sell shares it has purchased  and or shares it purchases from mr 
blair upon the exercise of the option 
registration rights held by capital z financial services fund ii would facilitate public resales of its shares of up up common stock 
thus  it is likely that a significant number of shares of up up common stock would be resold during the next four years 
the possibility of a sale of those shares could have an adverse effect on the trading market for up up s common stock 
a private sale of a significant number of shares could effect a change in control of up up 
effect on control of up up 
the controlling influence mr 
blair has with respect to up up is enhanced by his agreement to purchase the  shares of common stock 
however  mr 
blair has no right to vote those  shares until he actually purchases them from the trust 
the trust is required to vote the up up shares it holds in the same proportion as all other up up stockholders vote their shares 
in effect  the voting power held by all other stockholders is increased while the trust holds these shares 
mr 
blair s power to vote  shares  giving effect to the trust voting arrangement  would mean that he has approximately of the voting power 
in addition  up up has agreed to nominate two designees of capital z financial services fund ii for election as directors 
thus  capital z financial services fund ii could gain a significant influence in the business of up up 
regulation of up up as a savings and loan holding company up up has entered into an agreement to acquire for million a savings and loan holding company and its wholly owned  federal savings bank subsidiary  subject to the approval of shareholders of the holding company and federal banking regulators 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
if this acquisition is completed  up up would become a savings and loan holding company  subject to supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision of the us department of treasury 
up up would be a unitary savings and loan holding company  if the current control of up up by principal mutual holding company is divested  as proposed 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  up up generally will not be restricted under existing laws as to the type of business activities in which it may engage  provided the bank continues to meet the standards as a qualified thrift lender 
nevertheless  the office of thrift supervision will have enforcement authority over up up and its non savings association subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the office of thrift supervision to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings bank 
dependence on key personnel up up depends to a significant extent on its chairman and chief executive officer  thomas l 
blair  its president and chief operating officer  edward s 
civera  its vice president of operations  spiro a 
karadimas and its vice president and chief financial officer  s 
joseph bruno 
up up s growth and future success will depend in large part on its ability to retain and attract highly qualified personnel 
up up has entered into a five year employment agreement with mr 
civera extending to january   and has entered into two year employment agreements with messrs 
karadimas  blair and bruno  extending to january  if up up were to lose any of its key personnel  particularly any of its executive officers  or be unable to retain or hire qualified personnel  then it could be potentially and adversely affected 
potential impediments to takeover the concentration of ownership of its common stock could also impede any effort by a third party to effect a change of control of up up 
in addition  up up s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain a number of provisions that could inhibit a change of control by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise  including advance notice and supermajority provisions  provisions that establish a classified board of directors and provisions that enable up up to issue blank check preferred stock 
these provision could reduce or eliminate any takeover premium in the market price for up up s common stock or otherwise limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for up up s common stock 
also  if up up acquires the federal savings bank as it proposes  up up would be subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision as a savings and loan holding company 
the regulatory approval or notice requirements applicable to persons seeking to acquire control of a savings and loan holding company could inhibit or delay possible acquisition of up up  even acquisitions desired by up up s stockholders 
for regulatory purposes  presumptions of control can arise once a person s beneficial ownership  together with that of persons acting in concert  of outstanding voting stock exceeds 
up up s annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation up up s annual and quarterly operating results could fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including 
the expiration or termination of contracts with significant payor clients or contracting providers  
the timing of new product and service introductions  
changes in pricing  
increases in operating expenses  
increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  
increased competition  
the impact of acquisitions  
regulatory changes  and 
conditions in the healthcare industry and the economy generally 
historical annual or quarter to quarter comparisons of up up s results of operations may not be an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods up up s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the price of up up s common stock may decline 
lack of dividends up up does not plan to pay any dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
the market price of up up s common stock could be adversely affected by the risks to up up and other factors the potential impact of all of the above risk factors is difficult for up up to forecast 
nevertheless  these or other factors  such as fluctuations in up up s earnings  changes in estimates of those earnings by security analysts and sales of substantial amounts of up up s common stock in the public market  may materially adversely affect up up s operating results and or the trading price of the common stock 
recently  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of securities of many companies  for reasons frequently unrelated to the performance of the specific companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of up up s common stock 
up up does not guarantee that the trading price for the common stock will remain at or above the public offering price in this offering
