results of operations the company s consolidated net earnings were  or per share for the fiscal year ended june  slow order bookings in the first two quarters of the fiscal year contributed to softer than anticipated revenues and earnings during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
in response to slower than anticipated order bookings  the company initiated a cost reduction program in january and further accelerated this program in april during the third and fourth quarters  order bookings substantially improved 
atlas also improved the cost of many of its products during the year through increased standardization and other product development activities 
higher bookings in the second half of the fiscal year  combined with the lower operating costs achieved as a result of the cost reduction program  provided strong fourth quarter revenues and net earnings 
in general  order bookings during the year continued to be uneven due to the nature of the business

sales revenue and cost recognition sales are recognized using the percentage of completion method  which measures the percentage of contract costs incurred to date and compares these costs to the total estimated costs for each contract 
the company estimates the status of individual contracts when progress reaches a point where experience is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  repairs and depreciation costs 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined

management expects the financing facilities currently in place  including the company s  revolving line of credit  along with anticipated cash available from operations  will be sufficient for funding general operations and any required page current year asset purchases

during the fiscal year ended june   atlas entered into a new debt financing agreement with bank one na  the successor to the recent merger of bank one and first chicago nbd 
the bank consolidated all of atlas long and short term debts  bundling the various notes and lines of credit into one new three year committed line of credit  with increased maximum debt usage of  based on collateral including the company s receivables  work in process inventories  and other assets 
at june  atlas had borrowings outstanding of  compared to  at june  borrowings at june  included i outstanding borrowings under a revolving line of credit of  this borrowing was under the company s  revolving credit agreement expiring in january as noted  collateral for this facility includes atlas receivables  work in process  and other assets and atlas compliance with certain financial covenants

the note balance at fiscal june  was  the note bears interest at bank prime rate 
the final note is due january iv other borrowings outstanding of  at interest from concord commercial v deferred compensation due officers of  payable in annual installments with interest with final payment due july the company believes that  as a result of its loan facilities  its short term credit availability is adequate to support atlas business operation at current and near term anticipated sales levels 
page contingencies atlas has accrued certain financial reserves for contingencies of bad debts  product warranty and health insurance run off costs 
the latter is for atlas partially self funded health claims incurred prior to june  but not yet paid 
year compliance the company is installing an enterprise resource planning erp system at atlas  which includes computer systems for its internal accounting and reporting activities and its manufacturing operations and processes which are year compliant which means that such computer systems and other information technology will accurately process date time data regardless of whether the date is in the twentieth or twenty first century 
the acquisition and installation of the system are expected to cost approximately  of which approximately  was expended through june  because the system is being implemented as an overall upgrade to atlas s operations and not specifically to address year compliance concerns  management has not estimated the portion of the cost which may be allocable to year compliance 
atlas management has not yet assessed whether or not the failure of atlas s internal information technology to be year compliant would have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations since it believes that installation and operation of the new system will be accomplished in advance of december  the company is also assessing its major vendors  customers  utilities  banks and others with whom it does business to determine if their failure to be year compliant would have a material adverse effect upon the company or its financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
to date  nothing has come to the attention of management that leads it to conclude that the likelihood of such adverse effect reasonably exists 
the company s and atlas operations utilize relatively little electronic data interchange with vendors  customers and other third parties 
however  to the extent that such third parties  particularly utilities and banks  may not be year compliant  the company and atlas may be adversely affected  although the magnitude of such effect cannot be estimated 
the cost to the company of making its third party year compliance assessment is not expected to be material 
certain atlas products contain processors which address and utilize date time data 
management believes that such processors incorporated in equipment sold within the past five years are virtually all year compliant 
however  it is not able to determine the compliance status of processors used in equipment sold in earlier periods with any reasonable degree of certainty 
although such equipment is beyond the warranty periods applicable to atlas products  it is possible that customers who purchased equipment from atlas which is not year compliant may nevertheless assert claims against atlas to correct the compliance deficiencies or for resulting damages 
while management believes that atlas would not be legally responsible to such persons  based on the terms of its purchase orders and warranties  there can be no assurance that this position would prevail if challenged 
management is unable to estimate the potential cost that the company might incur if such claims are made and successfully sustained or whether or not such cost would have a material adverse effect upon its financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
recent accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of position sop  reporting on the cost of start up activities  in april and sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june these statements are effective in fiscal and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements various statements in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations and potential trends that may affect future results of operations are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the potential softening of the domestic and foreign markets for automobiles and automotive parts page resulting in reduced demand for the company s automation equipment  potential technological developments in the metal forming and handling automation equipment markets which render the company s automation equipment noncompetitive or obsolete  the company s failure to prevail in its patent suit against orchid  the failure of the company s older automation equipment to be year compliant  and the tightening of credit availability generally or under the company s credit facility which renders the company unable to access needed working capital 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
therefore  a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of the company s debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately  at june  borrowing levels
