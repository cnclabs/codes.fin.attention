capitalized terms that are used in this discussion and not defined herein have the meanings assigned to such terms in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the automotive supply industry in which the company competes is cyclical and is influenced by the level of north american and european vehicle production 
management believes the long term trends in the design and manufacture of automotive products include increased use of plastic components  increased sourcing of interior systems and increased reliance of automotive manufacturers on fewer suppliers  utilizing primarily those suppliers who can provide comprehensive engineering and design capabilities 
the company anticipates the reduction in the supply chain could result in integration whereby the complete interior of an automobile is co designed and developed by suppliers who will also manufacture  deliver and potentially install interior systems 
as a result of these trends  the company has undertaken the reorganization  a comprehensive plan designed to allow the company to better serve its customers through the creation of two divisions  north america automotive interior systems and europe automotive interior systems  to produce interior systems products  including molded floor carpet  luggage compartment trim  acoustical products  accessory floormats and plastic based interior trim systems 
as part of the reorganization  the company also established the specialty automotive products division  which manufactures products that are not typically sold in conjunction with other interior trim offerings 
results of operations compared to the divisions the company operates three divisions  with seven primary product lines 
certain prior year product line sales data have been reclassified to conform with reporting of the company s three divisions created in the reorganization

the certificates represent the right to receive payments generated by the receivables held by the trust 
availability under the variable funding certificates at any time depends primarily on the amount of receivables generated by the sellers from sales to the automotive industry  the rate of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables which affect their eligibility such as the bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor  delinquency and excessive concentration 
based on these criteria  at december  the maximum amount available under the variable funding certificates was million  of which million was unutilized 
the proceeds received by carcorp from collections on receivables  after the payment of expenses and amounts due on the certificates  are used to purchase new receivables from the sellers 
collections on receivables are required to remain in the trust if at any time the trust does not contain sufficient eligible receivables to support the outstanding certificates

cash interest paid was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
due to the variable interest rates under the credit agreement facilities and the receivables facility  the company is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  during april  the company entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement in which the company effectively exchanged million of fixed rate debt for floating rate debt at six month libor plus a margin 
in connection with this swap agreement  the company also limited its interest rate exposure on million of notional principal amount by entering into an cap on libor 
based upon amounts outstanding at december   a 
increase in each of libor and canadian bankers acceptance rates and  respectively  at december  would impact interest costs by approximately million annually on the credit agreement facilities and million annually on the receivables facility 
during april  the company entered into an agreement to limit its foreign currency exposure related to million of us dollar denominated borrowings of a canadian subsidiary 
the agreement swapped libor based interest rates for the canadian bankers acceptance rates and fixed the exchange rate for the principal balance upon maturation 
this agreement was terminated on june  as a result of repayment of the then outstanding canadian term loan 
the canadian term loan balance was repaid in conjunction with the refinancing and replacement of the replaced facilities 
the current maturities of long term debt primarily consist of the current portion of the credit agreement facilities  vendor financing  an industrial revenue bond and other miscellaneous debt 
the maturities of long term debt of the company s continuing operations during     and  are million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
the jps automotive senior notes will mature in in addition  the credit agreement facilities provide for mandatory prepayments of the term loan a and term loan b facilities with certain excess cash flow of the company  net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions by the company  net cash proceeds of certain sale leaseback transactions and net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt obligations 
the indenture governing the subordinated notes provides that in the event of certain asset dispositions  c a products must apply net proceeds to the extent not reinvested in the business first to repay senior indebtedness as defined  which includes the credit agreement facilities and then  to the extent of remaining net proceeds  to make an offer to purchase outstanding subordinated notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
c a products must also make an offer to purchase outstanding subordinated notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest if a change in control as defined of the company occurs 
in addition  the indenture governing the jps automotive senior notes requires jps automotive to apply the net proceeds from the sale of assets of jps automotive to offer to purchase jps automotive senior notes  to the extent not applied within days of such asset sale to an investment in capital expenditures or other long term tangible assets of jps automotive  to permanently reduce senior indebtedness of jps automotive or to purchase jps automotive senior notes in the open market 
the company caused jps automotive to make such an offer to purchase jps automotive senior notes in connection with the sale of airbag in july the company makes capital expenditures on a recurring basis for replacements and improvements 
as of december   the company s continuing operations had approximately million in outstanding capital expenditure commitments 
the company currently anticipates that its capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal will be in the range of million to million  a portion of which may be financed through leasing 
the company s capital expenditures in future years will depend upon demand for the company s products and changes in technology 
the company is sensitive to price movements in its raw material supply base 
during fiscal  prices for most of the company s primary raw materials remained constant with price levels at december  the prices of certain types of yarn utilized in fabric manufacturing declined during  resulting in cost savings of approximately million through december  in addition  the price of polyethylene has declined slightly in both north america and europe 
while the company may not be able to pass on future raw material price increases to its customers  it believes that a significant portion of the increased cost can be offset by continued results of its value engineering value analysis and cost improvement programs and by continued reductions in the cost of nonconformance 
after wallcoverings was classified as a discontinued operation in april  wallcoverings continued to experience sales declines 
from april through october  the company expended approximately million to fund operations  working capital and capital expenditures and to replace receivables previously sold to carcorp 
of these amounts  million represents repayments of intercompany amounts owed to wallcoverings 
from november  through its disposition in march  the company expended approximately million principally to fund wallcoverings operations  working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
of this amount  approximately million was added to the base purchase price of million provided in the sales agreement and was paid by the purchaser as part of the final purchase price 
the company has significant obligations relating to postretirement  casualty  environmental  lease and other liabilities of discontinued operations 
in connection with the sale and acquisition of certain businesses  the company has indemnified the purchasers and sellers for certain environmental liabilities  lease obligations and other matters 
in addition  the company is contingently liable with respect to certain lease and other obligations assumed by certain purchasers and may be required to honor such obligations if such purchasers are unable or unwilling to do so 
management currently anticipates that the net cash requirements of its discontinued operations will be approximately million in fiscal however  because the requirements of the company s discontinued operations are largely a function of contingencies  it is possible that the actual net cash requirements of the company s discontinued operations could differ materially from management s estimates 
management believes that the company s cash needs relating to discontinued operations can be provided by operating activities from continuing operations and by borrowings under its credit facilities 
tax matters at december   the company had outstanding net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
substantially all of these nols expire over the period from to the company also has unused federal tax credits of approximately million  million of which expire during the period to approximately million of the company s nols and million of the company s unused federal tax credits may be used only against the income and apportioned tax liability of the specific corporate entity that generated such losses or credits or its successors 
future sales of common stock by the company or its principal shareholders  or changes in the composition of its principal shareholders  could constitute a change in control that would result in annual limitations on the company s use of its nols and unused tax credits 
management cannot predict whether such a change in control will occur 
if such a change in control were to occur  the resulting annual limitations on the use of nols and tax credits would depend on the value of the equity of the company and the amount of built in gain or built in loss in the company s assets at the time of the change in control  which cannot be known at this time 
management has reviewed the company s operating results for recent years as well as the outlook for its continuing businesses in concluding it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
a major goal of the reorganization is to lower the overall cost structure of the company and thereby increase profitability 
these factors along with the timing of the reversal of its temporary differences and the expiration dates of its nols were also considered in reaching this conclusion 
the company s ability to generate future taxable income is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  the state of the automotive industry and other factors beyond management s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectation of future taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  provides for certain deferred tax assets that in management s assessment may not be realized due to tax limitations on the use of such amounts or that relate to tax attributes that are subject to uncertainty due to the long term nature of their realization 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that i affect ongoing operations and may increase capital costs and operating expenses and ii impose liability for the costs of investigation and remediation and otherwise relate to on site and off site contamination 
the company s management believes that it has obtained  and is in material compliance with  all material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct its various businesses 
environmental compliance costs for continuing businesses currently are accounted for as normal operating expenses or capital expenditures of such business units 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  such environmental compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
the company is legally or contractually responsible or alleged to be responsible for the investigation and remediation of contamination at various sites 
it also has received notices that it is a potentially responsible party prp in a number of proceedings 
the company may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
the company is currently engaged in investigation or remediation at certain sites 
in estimating the total cost of investigation and remediation  the company has considered  among other things  the company s prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  remediation efforts by other parties  data released by the united states environmental protection agency  the professional judgment of the company s environmental experts  outside environmental specialists and other experts  and the likelihood that other parties which have been named as prps will have the financial resources to fulfill their obligations at sites where they and the company may be jointly and severally liable 
under the theory of joint and several liability  the company could be liable for the full costs of investigation and remediation even if additional parties are found to be responsible under the applicable laws 
it is difficult to estimate the total cost of investigation and remediation due to various factors including incomplete information regarding particular sites and other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of environmental problems and the company s share  if any  of liability for such problems  the selection of alternative compliance approaches  the complexity of environmental laws and regulations and changes in cleanup standards and techniques 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   excluding sites at which the company s participation is anticipated to be de minimis or otherwise insignificant or where the company is being indemnified by a third party for the liability  there are sites where the company is participating in the investigation or remediation of the site  either directly or through financial contribution  and additional sites where the company is alleged to be responsible for costs of investigation or remediation 
as of december   the company s estimate of its liability for these sites  is approximately million 
as of december   the company has established reserves of approximately million for the estimated future costs related to all its known environmental sites 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  the environmental costs and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company has identified or properly assessed all potential environmental liability arising from the activities or properties of the company  its present and former subsidiaries and their corporate predecessors 
impact of year compliance the company has developed a comprehensive plan intended to address year issues the year plan 
the year plan includes the acceleration of the company s business systems integration plan the bsip plan  initiated in connection with the company s acquisitions to create common manufacturing  financial reporting and cost control information systems throughout the company as a whole 
the bsip plan  which affects essentially all the company s locations worldwide  involves new installations of hardware and software at acquired operations and upgrades to hardware and software at pre existing locations 
as part of the year plan  the company has selected a team of managers and outside consultants to identify  evaluate and implement a time table aimed at bringing all of the company s critical business systems and applications into year compliance prior to december  the year plan addresses the company s information technology and non information technology and categorizes them into the following areas which are vulnerable to year risk i business computer systems  including financial  human resources  purchasing  manufacturing and sales and marketing systems  ii manufacturing  warehousing and servicing equipment  including shop floor controls  iii technical infrastructure  including local area networks  mainframes and communication systems  iv end user computing  including personal computers  v suppliers  agents and service providers  including systems which interface with customers  vi environmental operations  including fire  security  emission and waste controls and elevators  and vii dedicated research and development facilities  including cad cae cam systems and product testing systems 
the company has evaluated the state of readiness of each area vulnerable to year risk using the following definitions inventory systems are being surveyed and documented regarding compliance remediation strategies are being implemented to modify or replace affected hardware and software testing systems are being tested by company employees or third party consultants complete systems are year compliant currently  the company estimates that a majority of its locations are progressing through the remediation or testing phases for each area of year risk 
the company intends for all of its systems in north america and europe to become year compliant during the company is in the process of finalizing formal contingency plans for each location 
these contingency plans include  among other things  the following i establishing back up production capacities within the company to shift the manufacturing of similar products between plants if a plant should be unable to complete its scheduled production requirements  ii carrying extra inventory of raw materials and finished goods to cover production requirements if critical suppliers indicate that they will not be year compliant in a timely manner  and iii maintaining offline documentation of production schedules  releases and inventory levels 
the company has not yet quantified the costs associated with these contingency plans 
the company currently anticipates that the total cost of the year plan  including approximately million of costs associated with the bsip plan but excluding costs associated with contingency plans  will be approximately million 
included in this estimate is approximately million of salaries and other payroll costs of company employees to the extent that they have devoted a portion of their time to the project 
approximately million of these costs have been incurred through december   including approximately million of salaries and other payroll costs 
the company has been expensing and capitalizing the costs to complete the year plan in accordance with appropriate accounting policies 
the company is funding the expenditures related to the year plan with cash flows from operations 
the company s current cost estimate of million is higher than its previous estimates primarily due to increased use of external consultants and increased allocation of internal resources to assist with implementing the bsip plan at the company s european locations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year process at this stage  it is difficult for the company to determine a reasonable likely year worst case scenario 
one possible scenario would be the failure of the company s key suppliers to become compliant 
to mitigate the risk of this  the company is in the process of assessing responses to questionnaires previously issued to its suppliers and visiting certain of these suppliers to assess their year readiness 
this process is expected to continue over the next several months 
as discussed above  the company is incorporating the responses received from the suppliers in formulating contingency plans 
due to the number of suppliers that the company deals with  the company is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the revenue that would be lost in the event such a scenario was realized 
the company s year efforts are ongoing and its overall plan  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
the company currently anticipates that  with the modifications discussed above  the year issue should not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  or if contingency plans fail  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
success of the year plan may to some extent depend on the availability of outside consultants as well as establishing reliable telecommunication links with the company s operations in europe and mexico 
further  there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the cost of the company s year plan and the dates by which the company believes it will be year compliant are based on management s current best estimates  which were derived based on numerous assumptions of future events  some of which are beyond the control of the company  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee  however  that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to modify the risk from these interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to policies and procedures 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s long term debt obligations 
the interest rate exposure for the company s variable rate debt obligations is currently indexed to libor  for us denominated debt  or the canadian bankers acceptance rate  for canadian denominated debt  of one  two  three or six months  as selected by the company 
the company uses interest rate swaps and other interest rate protection agreements to modify its exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing rates 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate protection agreements 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate protection agreements  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on implied libor and canadian bankers acceptance forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instrument s actual cash flows are denominated in both us dollar us and canadian dollar cad  as indicated in parentheses dollar amounts in thousands 
expected maturity date thereafter debt fixed rate us   average interest rate variable rate us       average interest rate variable rate cad  average interest rate interest rate derivatives fixed to variable swap us  average pay rate average receive rate interest rate cap on libor notional amount us  average strike price fair value december  total debt fixed rate us   average interest rate variable rate us   average interest rate variable rate cad   average interest rate interest rate derivatives fixed to variable swap us average pay rate average receive rate interest rate cap on libor notional amount us average strike price currency rate exposure the company is subject to currency rate exposure primarily related to foreign currency purchase and sale transactions and intercompany and third party loans 
the primary purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with these foreign currency exposures 
the company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options with durations of generally less than months 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the participating countries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common currency on that date 
the conversion did not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
at december   the company had outstanding the following foreign currency forward and option contract amounts amounts in thousands  except average contract rate weighted currency contract average unrealized currency sold received amount contract rate gain foreign currency forward contracts austrian schilling british pound  belgian franc british pound  belgian franc swedish krona  british pound german mark  british pound italian lire  british pound spanish peseta  canadian dollar us dollar  dutch guilder british pound  german mark british pound  spanish peseta german mark spanish peseta swedish krona swedish krona british pound  foreign currency options canadian dollar us dollar  contract amount is presented in us dollar equivalents based upon the year end exchange rates 
weighted average contract rates represent the rates of exchange  stated in the currency sold  as reflected in the underlying contract 
all forward contracts mature in the above table does not fully reflect the net foreign exchange rate exposure of the company because it does not include the intercompany funding arrangements denominated in foreign currencies and the foreign currency denominated cash flows from anticipated sales and purchases 
management believes that the foreign currency exposure relating to these items would substantially offset the exposures listed in the table above
