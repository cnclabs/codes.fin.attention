funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of income producing property held for investment  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate  and after adjustments for unconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships and joint ventures  to be the industry standard for reporting the operations of real estate investment trusts reits 
adjustments for investments in real estate partnerships are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
while management believes that ffo is the most relevant and widely used measure of the company s performance  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
additionally  the company s calculation of ffo  as provided below  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo increased by from to as a result of the activity discussed above under results of operations

currently  which is dependent on the company s investment grade rating 
the company s ratings are currently baa from moody s investor service  bbb from duff and phelps  and bbb from standard and poors 
the company is required to comply  and is in compliance  with certain financial and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing 
these financial covenants include among others i maintenance of minimum net worth  ii ratio of total liabilities to gross asset value  iii ratio of secured indebtedness to gross asset value  iv ratio of ebitda to interest expense  v ratio of ebitda to debt service and reserve for replacements  and vi ratio of unencumbered net operating income to interest expense on unsecured indebtedness

the company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  the company is allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of its distributions to stockholders 
as distributions have exceeded taxable income  no provision for federal income taxes has been made 
while the company intends to continue to pay dividends to its stockholders  it also will reserve such amounts of cash flow as it considers necessary for the proper maintenance and improvement of its real estate  while still maintaining its qualification as a reit 
the company s real estate portfolio has grown substantially during as a result of the acquisitions and development discussed above 
the company intends to continue to acquire and develop shopping centers in the near future  and expects to meet the related capital requirements from borrowings on the line 
the company expects to repay the line from time to time from additional public and private equity and debt offerings  such as those completed during and because such acquisition and development activities are discretionary in nature  they are not expected to burden the company s capital resources currently available for liquidity requirements 
the company expects that cash provided by operating activities  unused amounts available under the line  and cash reserves are adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
pacific retail trust merger on september   the company entered into an agreement of merger agreement with pacific retail trust pacific  a privately held real estate investment trust 
the agreement  among other matters  provides for the merger of pacific into regency  and the exchange of each pacific common or preferred share into shares of regency common or preferred stock

the merger will be accounted for as a purchase with the company as the acquiring entity 
new accounting standards and accounting changes the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas requires entities to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company does not believe fas will materially effect its financial statements 
g 
environmental matters the company like others in the commercial real estate industry  is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and the operation of dry cleaning plants at the company s shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
the company believes that the dry cleaners are operating in accordance with current laws and regulations and has established procedures to monitor their operations 
the company has approximately properties that will require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation 
these remediations are not expected to have a material financial effect on the company due to financial statement reserves and various state regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost for remediation to the state 
based on information presently available  no additional environmental accruals were made and management believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known matters will not have a material effect on the financial position  liquidity  or operations of the company 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during and and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of the shopping centers  however  substantially all of the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
year system compliance management recognizes the potential effect year may have on the company s operations and  as a result  has implemented a year compliance project 
the term year compliant means that the software  hardware  equipment  goods or systems utilized by  or material to the physical operations  business operations  or financial reporting of an entity will properly perform date sensitive functions before  during and after the year the company s year compliance project includes an awareness phase  an assessment phase  a renovation phase  and a testing phase of our data processing network  accounting and property management systems  computer and operating systems  software packages  and building management systems 
the project also includes surveying our major tenants and financial institutions 
total costs incurred to date associated with the company s year compliance project have been reflected in the company s income statement throughout and  and were approximately  the company s computer hardware  operating systems  general accounting and property management systems and principal desktop software applications are year compliant as certified by the various vendors 
we are currently testing these systems  and expect to complete the testing phase by june  based on initial testing  management does not anticipate any year issues that will materially impact operations or operating results 
an assessment of the company s building management systems has been completed 
this assessment has resulted in the identification of certain lighting  telephone  and voice mail systems that may not be year compliant 
while we have not yet begun renovations  management believes that the cost of upgrading these systems will not exceed  it is anticipated that the renovation and testing phases will be complete by june   and the company expects to be compliant upon completion of these phases 
the company has surveyed its major tenants and financial institutions to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to third parties failure to resolve their year issues 
the company will be able to more adequately assess its third party risk when responses are received from the majority of the entities contacted 
management believes its planning efforts are adequate to address the year issue and that its risk factors are primarily those that it cannot directly control  including the readiness of its major tenants and financial institutions 
failure on the part of these entities to become year compliant could result in disruption in the company s cash receipt and disbursement functions 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems of unrelated entities upon which the company s operations rely will be corrected on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not have a formal contingency plan or a timetable for implementing one 
contingency plans will be established  if they are deemed necessary  after the company has adequately assessed the impact on operations should third parties fail to properly respond to their year issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company has no plans to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes  and at december   the company did not have any borrowings hedged with derivative financial instruments 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts maturing in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         average interest rate for all debt variable rate libor debt      average interest rate for all debt as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
