item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we operate a global business  with net sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name  the quality of our global sales and service network  our continued investment in product development  our pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on opportunities in developed and emerging markets 
our financial information is presented in accordance with us gaap 
financial results following the acquisition of mettler toledo from ciba geigy in october  the safeline acquisition in may and our initial public offering in november are not comparable in many respects to the financial results prior to those events 
net sales in local currency increased in  in and in adjusted for our exit in from certain systems businesses 
the strengthening of the us dollar versus our major trading currencies reduced us dollar reported sales growth in and net sales in us dollars increased by and during and  respectively 
net sales in us dollars were unchanged in in  we had solid local currency sales growth of in both europe and the americas 
however  economic conditions in emerging markets have deteriorated significantly and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends  severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices 
moreover  economic problems in individual markets are increasingly spreading to other economies  adding to the adverse conditions facing nearly all emerging markets 
the effects of these economic conditions can be seen in the local currency sales decline in asia and other markets of compared to we remain committed to emerging markets  particularly those in asia  latin america and eastern europe 
we believe emerging markets will provide opportunities for growth in the long term based upon the movement toward international quality standards  the need to upgrade mechanical scales to electronic versions and the establishment of local production facilities by our multinational client base 
however  we expect current economic conditions may affect our financial results in these markets for the foreseeable future 
we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come primarily from i the needs of our lab and industrial customers in developed markets to continue to automate their research and development and manufacturing processes  ii the needs of our retail customers in europe to upgrade their scales for the implementation of the euro  iii the needs of our retail customers to implement sophisticated perishable goods management systems using weighing and pc technology in a networked environment  iv the needs of customers in emerging markets to continue modernizing research and development and manufacturing processes through the use of increasingly sophisticated instruments  and v acquisition opportunities 
we increased our gross profit margin before non recurring acquisition costs from in to in and increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs as a percentage of net sales from in to in this improved performance was achieved despite our continued investments in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure 
we believe that a significant portion of the increases in our adjusted operating income resulted from our strategy to reduce costs  re engineer our operations and focus on the highest value added segments of the markets in which we compete 
recent acquisitions we are the leading provider of automated lab reactors and reaction calorimeters to the automated drug and chemical compound discovery and development market 
we believe that our customers want solutions in this market from a company like mettler toledo  with a reputation for innovation and quality and with a global presence and service network 
in july  we extended our product offerings to the automated drug and chemical compound discovery market with our acquisition of bohdan automation inc bohdan is a leading supplier of laboratory automation and automated synthesis products used in research for life science applications for pharmaceutical and agricultural products and in other applications in the food and chemicals industries 
in december  we announced that we had acquired two technologically advanced instrument companies  applied systems and myriad synthesizer technology 
although these businesses are not currently significant in size  we believe these acquisitions are key elements in our strategic effort to further build a leading position in the field of automated solutions for drug and chemical compound discovery and development 
these acquisitions enable us to offer a strong and comprehensive array of solutions  from sample preparation to compound synthesis to process development 
applied systems designs  assembles and markets instruments for in process molecular analysis  which is primarily used for researching  developing and monitoring chemical processes 
applied systems proprietary sensors  together with its innovative fourier transform infrared technology  enable chemists to analyze chemical reactions as they occur  which is more efficient than pulling samples 
myriad synthesizer technology designs  assembles and markets instruments that facilitate and automate the synthesis of large numbers of chemical compounds in parallel  which is a key step in the chemical compound discovery process 
its products can be used in all stages of synthesis in drug discovery 
in may  we acquired safeline limited 
safeline is the world s largest manufacturer and marketer of metal detection systems for companies that produce and package goods in the food processing  pharmaceutical  cosmetics  chemicals and other industries 
safeline s metal detectors can also be combined with our checkweighing products for important quality and safety checks in these industries 
the financing of the safeline acquisition is discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
secondary offering and ipo in july  certain selling shareholders completed a secondary offering of a total of  shares of our common stock  including the underwriters over allotment options 
no directors  executive officers or other employees sold shares  and we did not sell shares or receive proceeds in the offering 
we incurred a charge of million in connection with the offering during the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  including the underwriters over allotment options  at a per share price of the ipo 
the ipo raised net proceeds  after underwriters commission and expenses  of approximately million 
concurrently with the ipo  we refinanced our existing credit facility by entering into a new credit facility  borrowings from which  along with the proceeds from the ipo  were used to repay substantially all of our then existing debt  including all of our senior subordinated notes due collectively  the refinancing 
in connection with the refinancing  we recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax  principally for prepayment premiums on certain debt repaid and for the write off of existing deferred financing fees 
we also paid a one time termination fee of million in connection with the termination of our management consulting agreement with aea investors inc cost reduction programs in  we recorded restructuring charges totaling approximately million in connection with the consolidation of three facilities in north america 
the charges related to severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities  including lease termination costs and write down of existing assets to their expected net realizable value 
the facility consolidations are part of our ongoing efforts to reduce costs through re engineering 
when complete  the facility consolidations will result in annual cost savings estimated at approximately million 
during most of these actions were completed  including the sale of two of the facilities for over million 
we continuously implement cost reduction programs 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from the consolidated statements of operations for the period from january  to october   for the period from october  to december   pro forma for the year and actual for the years ended december  and the pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition  the safeline acquisition  the ipo and the refinancing as if such transactions had occurred on january   and does not purport to represent our actual results if such transactions had occurred on such date 
the pro forma information reflects the historical results of operations of the predecessor business for the period from january  to october  and the historical results of operations of the company for the period from october  to december   together with certain pro forma adjustments as described below

these amounts were recorded as expenses immediately following the acquisition and the safeline acquisition  respectively 
the amounts related to the acquisition and the safeline acquisition have been excluded from the pro forma information 
c represents the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year  assuming the acquisition  the safeline acquisition  the ipo and the refinancing occurred on january  the pro forma data includes certain adjustments to historical results to reflect i an increase in interest expense resulting from acquisition related borrowings  which expense has been partially offset by reduced borrowings following application of ipo proceeds and a lower effective interest rate following the refinancing  ii an increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets following the acquisition and the safeline acquisition  iii a decrease in selling  general and administrative expense to eliminate the aea investors inc footnotes continued on following page footnotes continued from previous page annual management fee of  payment of which was discontinued upon consummation of the ipo and iv changes to the provision for taxes to reflect our estimated effective income tax rate at a stated level of pro forma earnings before tax for the year ended december  certain other one time charges incurred during have not been excluded from the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  d certain one time charges incurred during have not been excluded from the pro forma information 
these charges consist of certain non recurring items for i advisory fees associated with the reorganization of our structure of approximately  and ii restructuring charges of approximately  e in connection with the bohdan acquisition  we allocated  based upon independent valuations   of the purchase price to purchased research and development in process 
this amount was recorded as an expense immediately following the bohdan acquisition

for the year ended december   the amount shown includes a restructuring charge of  to consolidate three facilities in north america 
the amount for the year ended december  includes of expenses incurred on behalf of certain selling shareholders in connection with the secondary offering completed in july see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
g adjusted operating income is defined as operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs 
non recurring costs which have been excluded are the costs set forth in note a above and for the period from october  to december   and in pro forma  advisory fees associated with the reorganization of our structure of approximately  non recurring costs for the year ended december  include a charge of  in connection with the termination of our management services agreement with aea investors 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings loss as an indicator of our operating performance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currency including safeline for full year during results for were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased net sales in europe increased in local currencies during  versus the prior year 
we have continued to experience favorable sales trends in europe  which began in the second half of  as a result of the strengthening of the european economy 
net sales in local currencies during in the americas also increased due to improved market conditions across most product lines  offset in part by weakness in latin america 
net sales in local currencies in in asia and other markets decreased 
the sales decline in asia during results in part from a decline in net sales in southeast asia and korea 
in addition  during the second half of we also experienced a decline in net sales in japan 
our sales and operating results in asia and other emerging markets deteriorated due to poor economic conditions 
these results in us dollar terms have also been affected by severe currency devaluations 
we anticipate that market conditions in asia and other emerging markets may continue to adversely affect sales and that margins in that region may be reduced 
we believe that our sales growth on a us dollar basis was reduced by to percentage points during as a result of these poor economic conditions and devaluations 
the operating results for safeline which were included in our results from may  would have had the effect of increasing our net sales by an additional million in  if included from january  additionally  safeline s operating results during the same period would have increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs by million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for before non recurring acquisition costs 
the period excludes a million non cash charge associated with the excess of fair value over historical cost for inventories acquired in the safeline acquisition 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year 
however  the local currency spending level remained relatively constant for the year 
in july  we acquired bohdan automation inc  a leading supplier of laboratory automation and automated synthesis products 
we incurred a charge of million immediately following the acquisition based upon an independent valuation for purchased research and development costs for products being developed that have not established technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition which  if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use 
we expect that the projects underlying these research and development efforts will be substantially completed over the next two years 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year 
this decrease primarily reflects the benefits of ongoing cost efficiency programs 
adjusted operating income was million  or of sales  for  compared to million  or of sales  for the prior year  an increase of 
the period excludes the previously noted charge of million for the revaluation of inventories to fair value in connection with the safeline acquisition and million in connection with the termination of our management services agreement with aea investors at the time of our ipo 
interest expense decreased to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to benefits received from our ipo  refinancing and cash flow provided by operations 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the amount includes a one time charge of million relating to the secondary offering completed in july the amount also includes gains on asset sales offset by other charges 
the period includes restructuring related charges of million and other charges of million million after tax relating to i certain derivative financial instruments acquired in and closed in and ii foreign currency exchange losses resulting from certain unhedged bank debt denominated in foreign currencies 
such derivative financial instruments and such unhedged bank debt are no longer held pursuant to current company policy 
the tax rate for includes a benefit of approximately percentage points based upon a one time change in swiss tax law which benefited only the period 
the period also includes efficiencies in our global tax structure  offset by the non deductibility of purchased research and development charges incurred in connection with the bohdan acquisition 
the extraordinary loss of million in represents charges for the early repayment premium on our senior subordinated notes and the write off of capitalized debt issuance fees and related expenses associated with our senior subordinated notes and previous credit facilities 
net earnings excluding the expenses for purchased research and development and the secondary offering were million in  compared with net earnings before non recurring items of million in such non recurring items in include the previously mentioned charges for purchased research and development  the revaluation of inventories to fair value  the termination fee paid to aea investors  restructuring charges  losses relating to derivative financial instruments and unhedged bank debt denominated in foreign currencies  and extraordinary items debt extinguishment 
including non recurring items  net earnings for were million  compared with a net loss in of million 
year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  net sales were million for  compared to pro forma net sales of million 
as previously described  pro forma includes a full year of safeline s operating results  while only includes the operating results of safeline from may  net sales in local currencies during the year increased excluding safeline results from pro forma and excluding safeline results from both pro forma and actual 
net sales in local currencies in in europe increased as compared to net sales in local currencies in pro forma excluding safeline results from pro forma 
net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased  principally due to improved market conditions for sales to industrial and food retailing customers 
net sales in local currencies in in asia and other markets increased  primarily as a result of the establishment of additional direct marketing and distribution in the region 
during the six months ended december   sales trends in europe were more favorable compared to sales trends in the first two quarters of overall  our business in asia and other markets remained solid 
however  growth in net sales in southeast asia and korea which collectively represent approximately of our total net sales for slowed 
the operating results for safeline which as previously noted were included in our results from may  had the effect of increasing our net sales by million for additionally  safeline s operating results had the effect of increasing our adjusted operating income by million for the same period 
we recorded non cash purchase accounting adjustments for purchased research and development of million and the sale of inventories revalued to fair value of million during such period 
gross profit before non recurring acquisition costs as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for pro forma gross profit in includes the previously noted million non cash charge associated with the excess of the fair value over the historic value of inventory acquired in the safeline acquisition 
the improved gross profit percentage reflects the benefits of reduced product costs arising from our research and development efforts  ongoing productivity improvements and the depreciation of the swiss franc against our other principal trading currencies 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for pro forma  however  the local currency spending level remained relatively constant period to period 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for pro forma this increase was primarily a result of establishing additional direct marketing and distribution in asia 
adjusted operating income was million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in pro forma  an increase of excluding safeline results from both pro forma and actual 
the period excludes non recurring costs of million for the revaluation of inventories to fair value in connection with the safeline acquisition and million paid to terminate the management contract with aea investors 
as previously noted  in connection with the safeline acquisition  million of the purchase price was attributed to purchased research and development in process 
such amount was expensed immediately following the safeline acquisition 
the technological feasibility of the products being developed had not been established as of the date of the safeline acquisition 
interest expense was million for  compared to million for pro forma the difference is principally due to the fact that the pro forma information reflects a full year of the benefits of reduced borrowing costs in connection with our ipo and refinancing which occurred in november other charges  net of million for includes restructuring related charges of approximately million and other charges of approximately million relating to i certain financial derivative financial instruments acquired in and closed in and ii foreign currency exchange losses resulting from certain unhedged bank debt denominated in foreign currencies such derivative financial instruments and such unhedged bank debt are no longer held pursuant to current company policy 
the decrease compared to other charges  net of million for pro forma is principally a result of lower restructuring related charges in compared to pro forma million versus million 
the significant increase in our effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to the nondeductibility of goodwill and purchased research and development charges incurred in connection with the safeline acquisition 
net earnings before non recurring items were million in such non recurring items in include the previously mentioned charges for purchased research and development  the revaluation of inventories to fair value  the termination fee paid to aea investors  the restructuring of north american operations and losses relating to derivative financial instruments and unhedged bank debt denominated in foreign currencies 
including these charges of million after taxes  the net loss before extraordinary items was million for compared to net earnings of million for pro forma the extraordinary loss of million in represents charges for the early repayment premium on our senior subordinated notes and the write off of capitalized debt issuance fees associated with our senior subordinated notes and previous credit facilities 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the acquisition of the mettler toledo group from ciba geigy  our cash was used primarily for working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures  service debt and pay dividends to ciba geigy 
our liquidity was affected by the acquisition from ciba geigy as well as by subsequent acquisitions that we completed 
the acquisition was financed principally through capital contributions of million before related expenses  borrowings under a previous credit agreement of million and million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
in may  additional leverage was added through the acquisition of safeline 
the purchase price for safeline was pound million approximately million at may   including a post closing adjustment of pound million which was paid in october and an earn out of pound million which was paid in june we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our liquidity was improved as a result of our initial public offering ipo in november and the refinancing undertaken at that time 
in the refinancing  we entered into a new credit agreement and repurchased all of the notes using proceeds from the ipo and borrowings under the credit agreement 
at december   our consolidated debt  net of cash  was million 
we had borrowings of million under our credit agreement and million under various other arrangements as of december  of our credit agreement borrowings  approximately million was borrowed as term loans scheduled to mature in and million was borrowed under a multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million of availability remaining under the revolving credit facility 
at december   approximately million of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately million at december  changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
under the credit agreement  amounts outstanding under the term loans amortize in quarterly installments 
in addition  the credit agreement obligates us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances with the proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital stock or indebtedness and with certain excess cash flow 
the credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries  including restrictions and limitations on the ability to pay dividends to our shareholders  incur indebtedness  make investments  grant liens  sell financial assets and engage in certain other activities 
we must also comply with certain financial covenants 
the credit agreement is secured by certain of our assets 
cash provided by operating activities continues to significantly exceed our capital expenditure requirements 
our cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in the increase resulted principally from improved adjusted operating income and lower interest costs resulting from our ipo and related refinancing and reduced debt levels 
during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions and other investing activities including seller financing of million and assumed debt of million as well as contingent and other payments associated with acquisitions consummated in these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional borrowings 
we may be required to make additional earn out payments relating to certain of these acquisitions in the future 
capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities  including the purchase of land for  and construction of  our shanghai  china manufacturing facility 
our capital expenditures totaled million in pro forma  million in and million in capital expenditures for are expected to be similar to levels 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with borrowings available under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for at least several years  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside of switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
in recent years  the swiss franc and other european currencies have generally moved in a consistent manner versus the us dollar 
therefore  because the two effects previously described have offset each other  our operating profits have not been materially affected by movements in the us dollar exchange rate versus european currencies 
however  there can be no assurance that these currencies will continue to move in a consistent manner in the future 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
year issue we have in place detailed programs to address year readiness internally and with certain suppliers 
the year issue is the result of computer logic that was written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer logic that processes date sensitive information may recognize dates using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system or equipment failures 
pursuant to our readiness programs  all major categories of information technology systems and non information technology systems eg  equipment with embedded microprocessors in use by the company  including manufacturing  sales  financial and human resources  are being inventoried and assessed 
in addition  plans have been developed for the required systems modifications or replacements 
with respect to our information technology systems  we have completed the entire assessment phase and most of the remediation phase 
the remediation phase has been completed for most major facilities with the exception of facilities in spain  sweden and certain us and german facilities 
with respect to our non information technology systems  we have completed the assessment phase and nearly all of the remediation phase 
selected areas  both internal and external  will be tested to assure the integrity of our remediation programs 
the testing is expected to be completed by september we plan to have all internal mission critical information technology and non information technology systems year compliant by september we have also reviewed our products  including products sold in recent years  to determine if they are year compliant 
in our current product line we believe that most of our products are year compliant 
for products currently in use  we are reviewing the risks by product item with many customers and in many instances have suggested that the customer replace the older product 
we are also communicating with our major suppliers to assess the potential impact on our operations if those parties fail to become year compliant in a timely manner 
while this process is not yet completed  based upon responses to date  it appears that many of those suppliers have only indicated that they have in place year readiness programs  without specifically confirming that they will be year compliant in a timely manner 
risk assessment  readiness evaluation  action plans and contingency plans related to our significant suppliers are expected to be completed by september the costs incurred to date related to our year activities have not been material and  based upon current estimates  we do not believe that the total cost of our year readiness programs will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the total costs are not easy to quantify since many of the steps we are taking relate to ongoing systems updating  a small component of which relates to year compliance 
in certain instances we have accelerated such updates 
as a result of our ongoing systems updating  we do not expect to realize a significant reduction in related expenditures once the work on year compliance is completed 
our readiness programs also include the development of contingency plans to protect our business and operations from year related interruptions 
these plans should be completed by september and  by way of example  will include back up procedures  identification of alternate suppliers  where possible  and increases in safety inventory levels 
based upon our current assessment of our non information technology systems  we do not believe it necessary to develop an extensive contingency plan for those systems 
there can be no assurances  however  that any of our contingency plans will be sufficient to handle all problems or issues which may arise 
we believe that we are taking reasonable steps to identify and address those matters that could cause serious interruptions in our business and operations due to year issues 
however  delays in the implementation of new systems  a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in our systems and in the systems of our suppliers  a failure of such third parties to adequately address their respective year issues  or a failure of a contingency plan could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  we would experience a material adverse impact on our business if significant suppliers of components were unable to deliver on a timely basis  if major utilities failed  such as those providing water  electricity and telephone services  causing us to lose production capabilities or limit other operations  if a significant portion of our billing system was not functioning  causing a working capital deficit  or if costs increased from warranty claims or customer claims of product liability 
the statements set forth herein concerning year issues which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in particular  the costs associated with our year programs and the time frame in which we plan to complete year modifications are based upon management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived from internal assessments and assumptions of future events 
these estimates may be adversely affected by the continued availability of personnel and system resources  and by the failure of significant third parties to properly address year issues 
therefore  there can be no guarantee that any estimates  or other forward looking statements will be achieved  and actual results could differ significantly from those contemplated 
european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services 
switzerland is not part of the emu 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and noncash banking transactions 
the existing local currencies  or legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january  beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash transactions 
for a period of six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro 
we have recognized the introduction of the euro as a significant event with potential implications for existing operations 
currently  we operate in all of the participating countries in the emu 
we expect nonparticipating european union countries  such as great britain  where we also have operations  to eventually join the emu 
we have committed resources to conduct risk assessments and to take corrective actions  where required  to ensure we are prepared for the introduction of the euro 
we have undertaken a review of the euro implementation and have concentrated on areas such as operations  finance  treasury  legal  information management  procurement and others  both in participating and nonparticipating european union countries where we operate 
also  existing legacy accounting and business systems and other business assets have been reviewed for euro compliance  including assessing any risks from third parties 
progress regarding euro implementation is reported periodically to management 
because of the staggered introduction of the euro regarding noncash and cash transactions  we have developed our plans to address our accounting and business systems first and our business assets second 
we expect to be euro compliant within our accounting and business systems by the end of and compliant within our other business assets prior to the introduction of the euro bills and coins 
compliance in participating and nonparticipating countries will be achieved primarily through upgraded systems  which were previously planned to be upgraded 
remaining systems will be modified to achieve compliance 
we do not currently expect to experience any significant operational disruptions or to incur any significant costs  including any currency risk  which could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we are preparing plans to address issues within the transitional period when both legacy and euro currencies may be used 
we are reviewing our pricing strategy throughout europe due to the increased price transparency created by the euro and are attempting to adjust prices in some of our markets 
we are also encouraging our suppliers  even in switzerland  to commence transacting in euro 
we do not believe that the effect of these adjustments will be material 
we have a disproportionate amount of our costs in swiss francs relative to sales 
historically  the potential currency impact has been muted because currency fluctuations between the swiss franc and other major european currencies have been minimal and there is greater balance between total european including swiss sales and costs 
however  if the introduction of the euro results in a significant weakening of the euro against the swiss franc  our financial performance could be harmed 
the statements set forth herein concerning the introduction of the euro which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in particular  the costs associated with our euro programs and the time frame in which we plan to complete euro modifications are based upon management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived from internal assessments and assumptions of future events 
there can be no guarantee that any estimates or other forward looking statements will be achieved  and actual results could differ significantly from those contemplated 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income  and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each legal entity is determined either i on a non consolidated combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated combined affiliated entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future 
such sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of future costs of environmental compliance 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china  latin america and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  if our presence in china  latin america and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
seasonality our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  with sales in the first quarter slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter slightly higher than  sales in the second and third quarters 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge short term intercompany balances with our foreign businesses 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against all of our currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million 
any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million net reduction in the net aggregate market value of these instruments 
any change in fair value would not effect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the variable rate debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
we have designated certain of our swiss franc debt as a hedge of our net investments 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on such debt at december  indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against the swiss franc  the fair value of such debt would increase by million 
any changes in fair value of the debt are recorded in comprehensive income and offset the impact on comprehensive income of foreign exchange changes on the net investments which they hedge 
new accounting standards in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires entities to capitalize certain internal use software costs once certain criteria are met  and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  management estimates the adoption of this statement will not have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  management has not determined the effect of the adoption of this statement 
recent sec announcements in september  the sec raised the concern that us reporting companies were classifying an ever growing portion of the acquisition price for acquisitions as purchased in process research and development 
we recorded a charge for purchased in process research and development in based upon an independent valuation relating to the acquisition of bohdan automation inc we believe that this charge was calculated in accordance with us gaap and recent sec guidance 
however  if the sec were to adopt a different standard on a retroactive basis than that applied by the company or object to our application of the recent sec guidance  we could be required to restate our earnings 
moreover  any adjustment could result in earnings in the future being reduced by additional goodwill amortization 
we recorded similar charges in our and consolidated financial statements relating to prior acquisitions 
these consolidated financial statements were audited by our independent accountants
