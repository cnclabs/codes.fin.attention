the company manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of the company s operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the dollar 
the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index was approximately in  in and in  while the shekel was devalued by approximately  and  respectively 
as a result  for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in corresponding increases in these costs in us dollars in  but a decrease in and to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition

see item business risk factors capital needs and variability of operating results 
year the company uses and relies on a variety of information technologies  computer systems and scientific and manufacturing equipment containing computer related components such as programmable logic controllers and other embedded systems 
certain of the company s computer systems and equipment use two digit fields rather than four digit fields to define the applicable year 
as a result  such systems may not be able to distinguish between dates in the th century and the st century 
this could cause system or equipment shutdowns  failures or miscalculations resulting in inaccuracies in computer output or disruptions of operations  including inaccurate processing of financial information and or temporary inabilities to process transactions  manufacture products or engage in normal business activities 
the company has conducted an evaluation of the actions necessary to ensure that its business critical computer systems and equipment will be able to function without disruption with respect to the application of dating systems in the year this evaluation was completed by the end of  following which the company upgraded  replaced and tested its computer systems and equipment so as to be able to operate without disruption due to year issues 
the company expects to complete all its remediation efforts before the end of however  there can be no assurance that any required remedial actions will be able to be completed on a timely basis 
if the company is unable to complete its remedial actions in the necessary time frame  contingency plans will be developed to address those business critical systems which may not be year compliant 
in addition to risks associated with the company s own computer systems and equipment  the company has relationships with  and is to varying degrees dependent upon  a number of third parties that provide goods  services and information to the company 
these include contract manufacturers  suppliers  licensees  vendors  research partners and financial institutions 
if any of these third parties experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to year non compliance  which systems and equipment are outside the control of the company  it could affect the company s ability to manufacture products or engage in normal business activities 
the company has made contact with all of its significant customers  suppliers  vendors and partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to their failures and to ascertain their year compliance and risk 
based on these responses  the company believes that its significant customers  suppliers  vendors and partners will be year compliant 
the total cost of the year systems evaluation and remediation is being funded through operating cash flows and the company is expensing these costs 
while the total cost to obtain year compliance is not known at this time  the company currently expects the cost to be less than  of which approximately  has been expended through december  the actual cost  however  could exceed this estimate 
the company believes that such cost will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
