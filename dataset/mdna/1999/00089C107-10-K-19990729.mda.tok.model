item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the description of business  financial statements and the related notes of ade which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect ade s plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ade was founded in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitance and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
our products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the semiconductor wafer  device and data storage manufacturing processes 
we operate three major business segments  the semiconductor systems group  ade phase shift and ade technologies 
the semiconductor systems group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on silicon wafer surfaces 
ade phase shift manufactures high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced interferometric technology that provides enhanced yield management to the data storage  semiconductor and optics industries 
ade technologies manufactures high precision magnetic characterization and non contact dimensional metrology gaging systems primarily for the data storage industry 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon shipment  provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods the services are provided 
we do not provide the right to return products 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered  fees are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue from software consulting services provided on a time and reimbursable expense basis is recognized as the services are provided 
on june   ade merged with phase shift technology  inc  an arizona corporation 
each outstanding share of phase shift s common stock was exchanged for two shares of the ade s common stock 
a total of  shares of our common stock were issued in this transaction 
this transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect the inclusion of phase shift operations 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in ade s consolidated statements of operations 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development purchased in process research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from operations other income  net net income loss restructuring in january  we began to consolidate our charlotte  north carolina operations and certain of our milpitas  california operations into our massachusetts facilities to better align our cost structure with prevailing semiconductor and data storage market conditions and to position ourselves with more efficient operations for expected industry recoveries 
anticipated savings when the consolidation efforts are completed include reduced cost of sales due to reduced capacity related expense  reduced payroll and related costs and reduced travel costs 
expenses associated with these consolidations incurred in fiscal totaled million  including a restructuring charge of million and million in other non recurring expenses 
the restructuring charges include severance costs of million related to the termination of employees in general and administrative  marketing and sales  manufacturing  and engineering functions   in lease termination penalties and  in non cash fixed asset impairments related to furniture  fixtures and building improvements on the terminated leased facilities 
other non recurring expenses include travel  consulting  and employee retention bonuses and have been included in general and administrative expenses 
retention bonus expense relates to payments to employees who have been notified of their termination dates  but whose services are required through specified dates during the consolidation process 
this expense is recorded ratably over the respective estimated service periods 
we anticipate recruiting costs and labor redundancy costs in future periods associated with replacing certain personnel currently in charlotte who have elected not to relocate to massachusetts 
additionally  we anticipate moving and related costs to be incurred through calendar  which will be included in general and administrative expenses in future reporting periods 
restructuring charge activity during fiscal and the related accrual as of april  is as follows balance at may  restructuring provision  non cash fixed asset impairments lease termination payments balance at april   these consolidation efforts may have an adverse impact on our near term ability to complete the development and manufacture of certain of our new semiconductor industry inspection products within the time frames required by our customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our strategic goals  satisfactorily support our customers or operations or successfully bring new products to market on a timely basis while aligning our cost structure with market conditions 
realizability of deferred tax assets at april   we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million  as the full value of our net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences may not be realized 
this increase was based upon weighing all evidence available to management  including fiscal pre tax losses of million  current estimates of future taxable income  the cyclicality of the semiconductor and data storage industries and the current uncertainty within those markets 
net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal begin to expire in fiscal for state income tax purposes 
we will need to generate approximately million of future taxable income to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets as of april  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could materially change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income change or do not materialize 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal decreased sales of our products were primarily due to reduced demand for capital equipment 
semiconductor systems group revenue decreased  reflecting the excess capacity for mm wafer production and continued delays in implementing production of mm wafers 
our capital equipment systems are sold primarily at the beginning of the semiconductor production process  with percent of consolidated revenue coming from semiconductor wafer manufacturers 
within the semiconductor device market  which accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue  there have been positive statements of an industry recovery by leading device manufacturers 
most of our wafer making customers  however  have not been profitable for more than a year 
consequently  these customers continue to implement strict controls on capital expenditures  which has adversely impacted sales of our equipment 
a competitor has shipped multiple optical inspection products for advanced millimeter and millimeter wafers to some of our semiconductor customers 
we believe that our next generation optical inspection product  which has been shipped to customers on a limited basis  is in many ways technologically superior to the competitor s product 
however  unless and until we are able to achieve broad market acceptance of this product and implement volume production  our sales of wafer inspection systems could be adversely affected 
ade phase shift and ade technologies revenue decreased and  respectively 
decreased sales of these segments were primarily due to excess capacity and the ongoing consolidation occurring in the data storage industry creating reduced demand for capital equipment 
ade phase shift also experienced decreased sales of its products to the optics and other industries 
while recognition of the importance of a production metrology strategy within the data storage industry is increasing  which would create increased demand for metrology products  we remain cautious as to when capacity driven purchases of our equipment will return 
revenue from sales to japan ade ltd  our owned affiliate and a distributor of our products  by the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies are reflected in segment revenue during the period they are shipped by the respective segment  which can differ from the period the revenue is recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on sales to japan ade ltd is recognized when the related product or software is shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
consolidated revenue in fiscal was million more than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue that was recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but recognized in a prior period on a segment basis 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal semiconductor systems group gross margins decreased primarily due to excess manufacturing capacity and incremental increases in excess and obsolete inventory expense combined with relatively fixed costs associated with its customer service organization 
ade phase shift gross margins remained consistent in fiscal with fiscal  while ade technologies gross margins decreased due to excess manufacturing capacity and significant increases in excess and obsolete inventory expense compared to that incurred in fiscal in order to increase our capacity utilization  ade has completed relocation of ade technologies milpitas  california manufacturing operations into its newton  massachusetts facility 
the consolidation of the semiconductor systems group manufacturing operations from charlotte  north carolina into westwood  massachusetts is expected to be completed in calendar year research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increase as a percentage of revenue despite the decrease in absolute expense occurred due to the decrease in revenue in the current year 
semiconductor systems group expense decreased primarily due to significantly reduced consulting expense 
ade phase shift expense decreased primarily due to strict cost control measures implemented as a result of the adverse impact on its revenue of the data storage industry downturn 
ade technologies expense increased due to payroll and project materials increase related to the development of next generation magnetics characterization systems for the data storage industry 
ade continues to develop and enhance advanced mm and mm metrology and surface inspection tools  including bridge tools that provide for the transition to mm  for the semiconductor industry 
increased capacity demand for advanced mm wafers is expected prior to adoption of the mm wafer standard 
there is currently no significant production capacity for mm wafers 
we are currently accelerating our mm development efforts in order to ensure the availability of second generation mm systems to meet the current short cycle budgeting environment in the semiconductor industry 
we expect research and development expense to continue to be significant as a percentage of revenue due to these near term development efforts 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the decrease in expense results from decreased sales commissions expense to external sales representatives  primarily in asia  for the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies due to significantly reduced revenue during the period 
the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold may have a significant impact on our marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of expense in future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
expense decreased at each of our reportable segments primarily due to our aggressive cost reduction strategy implemented throughout fiscal  which included strict controls over discretionary spending at each of our segments and reductions in workforce at the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies 
these decreases were partially offset by million in non recurring expenses associated with the restructuring discussed above 
other income 
other income was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal interest income of million was partially offset by interest expense of  associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and semiconductor systems group manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts and the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ade technologies in newton  massachusetts 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the fiscal rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of a million increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of april   partially offset by alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
the fiscal rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of the benefits from ade s foreign sales corporation  state income taxes and various tax credits 
the fiscal rate was higher than the fiscal rate due primarily to the benefit from increased federal and state research and development tax credits primarily realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the impact of increase in the valuation allowance discussed above 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales our products 
revenue for the semiconductor systems group  ade phase shift and ade technologies increased  and from the year earlier period  respectively 
the increase in unit sales resulted primarily from strong demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor and data storage industries  as well as increased throughput in each of the segment s manufacturing operations 
revenue from sales to japan ade ltd  our owned affiliate and a distributor of our products  by the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies are reflected in segment revenue during the period they are shipped by the respective segment  which can differ from the period the revenue is recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on sales to japan ade ltd is recognized when the related product or software is shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
consolidated revenue for in fiscal was  more than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue that was recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but recognized in a prior period on a segment basis 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to costs associated with increased manufacturing capacity and overhead expense associated with the semiconductor systems group operating in ade s new headquarters and expanded manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts 
the semiconductor system group also operated in expanded facilities in charlotte  north carolina during all of fiscal compared to only the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we also purchased and renovated our former manufacturing facility in newton  massachusetts during fiscal  which currently serves as the headquarters of ade technologies 
additionally  we increased our worldwide customer service organization to support our higher levels of semiconductor system sales  with the related personnel and travel costs contributing to a lower overall gross margin 
gross margin for ade phase shift remained consistent in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the continued delays in expected volume sales of millimeter equipment and our belief that a second generation of millimeter products will become available by the time volume purchases begin resulted in significantly increased expenditures on the semiconductor system group s millimeter surface inspection and wafer thickness products 
ade phase shift increased research and development expense as it continued to expand and enhance its interferometric metrology products for the data storage  optics and other industries 
ade technologies increased research and development expenses primarily due to increased project materials associated with development of its magnetics characterization systems for the data storage industry 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increase in expenses reflected the growth of the marketing and sales organizations to support the semiconductor systems group s and ade technologies increased sales volume  with the decrease as a percentage of revenue reflecting growth in expense at a slower rate than the overall increase in sales 
ade phase shift s marketing and sales expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to strict cost control procedures 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
expenses increased at each of ade s segments as we continued to develop management infrastructure to support our rapid growth 
fiscal expenses for the semiconductor systems group included million in additional bad debt reserves due to the adverse economic conditions in certain asian countries as well as the impact of the semiconductor industry downturn on certain domestic customers 
other income 
other income was million in fiscal versus  in fiscal fiscal interest income of million was partially offset by interest expense of  associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of ade s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts and the headquarters and primary manufacturing facility of the ade technologies in newton  massachusetts 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively  and differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of benefits from the use of ade s foreign sales corporation and state income taxes 
the fiscal rate was lower than the fiscal rate due to the benefit of investment tax credits resulting from increased capital spending in fiscal  and the benefit from increased federal and state research and development tax credits primarily realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal selected consolidated quarterly operating results the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning may  and ending april  this information has been derived from ade s unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with ade s annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly 
our quarterly revenue typically is derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders may consist of multiple systems  each of which are priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of other factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and data storage industries product mix of our sales for the period the sales distribution channel of our sales for the period competitive pricing pressures our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis customer cancellations or rescheduled shipments production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components resulting in delayed shipments seasonal factors such as customers capital budget approval cycles 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
significant levels of our expenses are fixed in advance and based in part on our expectations as to future revenue 
as a consequence  any material shortfall in revenue in a given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our earnings

customers may cancel or reschedule shipments 
product shipments could be delayed by production difficulties or critical component inventory shortages 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as cost of revenue includes manufacturing overhead  which is relatively constant from quarter to quarter  gross margin can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to varying levels of production and revenue 
marketing and sales expenses can vary from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors  including mix of sales channels  geographic mix and the timing of marketing events 
there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in any future period 
fourth quarter adjustments at april   we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million  as the full value of our net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences may not be realized 
this increase was based upon weighing all evidence available to management 
recording this increase to the valuation allowance decreased our annual effective tax rate to  compared to the estimated annual effective tax rate of utilized during the first three quarters of fiscal also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory by million for ade technologies and million for the semiconductor systems group 
we recorded a million credit to the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included a million credit resulting from the difference between our actual effective tax rate for fiscal of and the estimated effective tax rate of utilized during the first three quarters of fiscal also in the fourth quarter of  we reversed accrued bonus expense of million  which had been recorded in the first two quarters of fiscal the difference between our actual effective tax rate and the estimated effective tax rate used in the first three quarters of fiscal resulted primarily from the effect of a million pre tax loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to pre tax income of million for the first three quarters of fiscal also contributing to the difference in the estimated and actual effective tax rates were larger than anticipated federal and state research and development tax credits due in part to expenditures in the fourth quarter the reversal of the accrued bonus expense reflects our cost reduction measures initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal pro forma net income for the nine months ended january   including the reversal of the bonus accrual and utilizing the actual effective tax rate of  is  compared to reported net income for the nine months ended january  of  liquidity and capital resources at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
in addition  we had million in restricted cash used as security for a tax exempt industrial development bond issued through the massachusetts industrial finance agency in december we may substitute a letter of credit in an amount equal to approximately of the outstanding principal balance as collateral for our obligations under this bond  assuming we have the ability to borrow under the credit facility described below or another facility 
this substitution would allow the restricted cash balance to be used for general corporate purposes 
we also have an unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a bank  with a maximum borrowing amount of million or a specified percentage of accounts receivable  whichever is less 
the credit facility provides us the option of borrowing at either the bank s prime rate or the bank s libor rate plus 
the credit facility expires and any balance is due december  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at april  at april   we were in violation of certain financial covenants related to the credit facility  which provides the bank with the right to withhold future advances under the credit facility  to require cash deposits as security for any future advances or to offset any and all of our cash deposits with the bank against any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
we are renegotiating the terms and conditions of the credit facility  in the event that we seek to obtain funds under the credit facility 
at april   ade was in violation of certain financial covenants related to a standby letter of credit used as security for a tax exempt industrial development bond issued through the massachusetts industrial finance agency in june we received a waiver of this default and have renegotiated these covenants and other terms and conditions of this letter of credit 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended april  was million 
this amount resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for net non cash charges of million and a million net decrease in working capital accounts 
non cash items consisted of million of depreciation and amortization   in non cash restructuring charges and million as our share of the net loss of affiliated companies  net of cash dividends received from the affiliates  partially offset by an  increase in deferred tax assets 
the non cash restructuring charge related to a  write down of fixed assets 
the increase in deferred tax assets resulted primarily from the asset write down  increased accrued severance liabilities discussed below and net operating loss carry forwards generated by fiscal pre tax operating losses as of april  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could materially change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income change or do not materialize 
the net decrease in working capital total of million was comprised of decreased accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses of million  million and  respectively  and a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
these amounts were partially offset by decreased accounts payable and deferred income on sales to japan ade ltd  our owned japanese affiliate  of million and  respectively  and increased income tax refund receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from the significantly decreased billings and revenue during the last three quarters of fiscal and collections of outstanding receivable balances 
the decrease in inventory resulted primarily from a million increase in our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and  in gross inventory decreases 
some of our major semiconductor wafer maker customers have significant open floor space they had constructed in anticipation of a mm ramp up 
demand for equipment to fill that space could occur abruptly  and we therefore anticipate increases in our inventory balances in the near future to be able to quickly respond to customer needs 
the decrease in prepaid expenses results primarily from the timing of payments 
the increase in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities resulted from approximately million in accrued employee severance and retention bonus expense related to the operations consolidation and timing differences in the receipt of vendor supplier invoices and the accounts payable cycle 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from decreased inventory purchases and reductions in other purchase commitments  including research and development project materials and consulting  as well as the timing of the payables cycle 
the decreased deferred income on sales to affiliate resulted from decreased product shipments to japan ade ltd 
the increase in income tax receivable resulted from increased income tax refunds due to ade through net operating loss carrybacks generated by fiscal pre tax operating losses 
cash used in investing activities was million  and consisted of million for purchases of fixed assets and million in advances to affiliated companies  partially offset by aggregate reductions of  in restricted cash and other assets 
through april   we have invested million in a new manufacturing facility for ade phase shift in tucson  arizona to provide additional manufacturing capacity as ade phase shift s products and technology are integrated with our other business segments 
we anticipate total costs of this facility to be million 
we also anticipate investing approximately million in renovating our westwood  massachusetts facility to accommodate the consolidation of the semiconductor systems group s surface inspection operations from charlotte  north carolina 
cash provided by financing activities was million  which resulted primarily from million in proceeds from an industrial development bond issued through the industrial development authority of the county of pima  arizona and million of aggregate proceeds from the issuance of common stock and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
these amounts were partially offset by  in repayments of long term debt 
the industrial development bond carries an interest rate of 
monthly principal and interest payments on this bond are approximately  through march  with the remaining principal balance due at that time 
the proceeds were used to partially fund the construction of a new manufacturing facility for ade phase shift in tucson  arizona 
the bonds are secured with a standby letter of credit from a financial institution  which has annual fees of of the outstanding bond balance and is secured by a mortgage on the building 
we expect to meet our near term working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily through our available cash and cash equivalents and the above referenced credit facility assuming waiver of the existing default 
year ade has formed a task force to assess the nature  extent and cost of remediation of any year readiness issues confronting us and our suppliers  customers and other critical third parties 
the project encompasses reviewing our products and internal systems  both information technology and non information technology as well as the year readiness of companies with which we have a material relationship  including customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  utility providers and governmental agencies 
this assessment has begun at each of our operating units and we have identified certain requisite corrective actions 
products 
we are in the process of completing year readiness testing utilizing testing guidelines prepared by a consortium of semiconductor manufacturers 
corrective actions for noncomplying software included in our products have included formulating software patches that provide proper system operation or a combination of software patches and upgrades that provide proper system operation and the reporting of the year these patches and upgrades have been or will be provided to customers 
additionally  we have demonstration beta systems installed at customer sites that are not currently year ready 
these systems are expected to be removed from customer sites by october and replaced with new  year ready systems that will be purchased by the customers 
we also sell software products that are bundled with or sold separately from our capital equipment products 
the ability of a majority of these software products to function as a year ready product is dependent upon the year readiness of the user s operating system and any other software with which our products will interact 
testing and corrective actions related to year issues in our products has been completed except for the above mentioned demonstration units 
however  notwithstanding such efforts  any failure of our products to perform  including system malfunctions due to the onset of the year  could result in claims against us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
information technology 
we have substantially completed our review of our internal software applications and have determined that all network systems and server architecture are year ready 
we utilize standard  vendor supplied software for our electronic mail  corporate communications  engineering design  manufacturing and materials purchasing planning  accounting  desktop and database systems 
we have contacted these vendors to obtain assurances that these information technology systems are or will be year compliant 
this testing will be completed by august to the extent that some older versions of these software systems may not be year compliant and are currently being utilized by employees  we intend to upgrade such systems to achieve year readiness 
the failure of any of our information technology systems to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on us and no assurance can be provided that all such programs will be implemented on a timely basis 
non information technology 
we are aware of potential non information technology system building security  voice mail  telecommunications  utility and water systems  etc 
risk associated with the year issue and are currently evaluating our potential exposure at each of our facilities 
we anticipate that any necessary renovation of our non information technology systems as well as the validation of any repairs will be substantially completed by august formal queries to landlords  water  utility and telecommunications providers for our domestic and international locations  and other third parties with whom we have a material relationships have been sent to these suppliers to assess the systems year readiness 
suppliers and customers 
we are in the process of inquiring of our significant suppliers and customers the status of their year readiness through completion of a year readiness supplier questionnaire that has been developed by a consortium of semiconductor manufacturers 
all such requests have been sent as of april  and we have received responses to approximately of these inquiries 
each of the responses received has indicated the respective third party is or will be year ready by december  however  we have no means of assuring that third parties will achieve year readiness 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that it  non it and other suppliers who have provided year readiness documentation will be year compliant or that such documentation accurately and fully reflects the year readiness of their systems 
our assessments of the effects of year on us are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and our reliance on that information 
the failure of any such supplier s systems to be year compliant may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
year costs and expenses 
we have used both internal and external resources to address year readiness and to program  test and implement software for year modifications 
we specifically track the costs associated with task force meetings including related travel expenditures  year educational seminars  product software testing and patch development costs consulting and internal payroll costs  network server upgrades  internal payroll costs related to the contacting of third parties to determine year status  and postage and related costs associated with providing patches and upgrades to customers for software utilized in our products 
we have not separately tracked the costs of utilizing our internal information systems personnel in addressing our year readiness  with these costs principally relating to payroll and related benefits 
total costs for year readiness are currently estimated to be approximately  of which approximately  have been incurred through april  costs incurred to date have been  and anticipated future costs are expected to be funded through operations 
as we continue to complete our year readiness plan  actual costs may exceed the current estimate 
contingency plans 
our contingency plan with respect to the year issue is currently being developed 
we are in the process of reviewing the status of all third party suppliers 
replacement suppliers will be identified for critical suppliers who we believe will not be year ready 
we are considering contingency plans on a global basis relative to systemic failure of electricity or telecommunications beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that any contingency plan measures will mitigate the impact of year problems 
if unforeseen year readiness efforts are required or if the cost of any updates  modifications or replacement of our systems or products exceeds our estimates  the year issue could result in material costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing year problems as they relate to our products and internal systems 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties with which we interact will not suffer from year problems 
furthermore  year problems that have been or may in the future be identified with respect to the information technology and non information technology systems of third parties having widespread national and international interactions with persons and entities generally for example  certain systems of governmental agencies  utilities and information and financial networks could have a major impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario  is the disruption of our business operations and or those of our customers 
another reasonably likely worst case scenario is a systemic failure beyond our control  including but not limited to prolonged electrical or telecommunications failures or general disruptions in global business activities 
risks associated with such disruptions include  but are not limited to  increased operating costs  disruption in product shipments  loss of customer orders  and claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on ade 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement establishes new standards for the recognition of gains and losses on derivative instruments and provides guidance as to whether a derivative may be accounted for as a hedging instrument 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning in fiscal we currently do not utilize derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities and  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations
