item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its initial public offering in june  the company has executed an aggressive acquisition strategy acquiring twenty three companies  significantly expanding the company s national and international presence and increasing the number of management consulting and it service offerings provided by the company 
with the growth came a reorganization of the company s structure into four business segments business strategy  enterprise solutions group  government solutions group and information technology consulting services itcs  and a renaming of the company to renaissance worldwide  inc to reflect the company s expanded international presence and broader range of consulting services 
five of these acquisitions were completed during fiscal exad galons and hackenberg and partners were acquired in the first quarter of fiscal expanding the international presence of the enterprise solutions group 
neoglyphics media corporation neoglyphics and triad data corporation triad were acquired in the second quarter of fiscal with neoglyphics adding internet development and e commerce services to the enterprise solutions group and triad further expanding the information technology consulting services group 
in the third quarter of fiscal  international public access technologies ipat was acquired and added to our acquisition  eligibility management systems  to form the company s government solutions group 
consulting services performed are billed either on a time and materials basis  as is the case with the itcs group and certain sectors of the solutions groups  or on a fixed price basis for the remainder of the solutions groups and the business strategy group 
revenue for fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the number of labor hours incurred compared to the total estimated labor hours at estimated realizable rates 
under the percentage of completion method  the company must estimate the percentage of completion of each project at the end of each financial reporting period 
estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in projected completion costs or dates 
the cumulative effect of any revision in estimates of the percentage of completion  or the effect of identifiable losses on cost over runs  is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in the estimate or the loss becomes known 
the company mitigates the risk of losses for cost over runs by subdividing its projects into smaller phases 
in these cases  the company and its clients agree on a fixed price and fixed time frame before beginning each phase of the project 
these agreements may be revised  by mutual agreement  when a significant change in the scope or cost of a phase arises that neither the company nor the client had anticipated 
because the company bears the risk of cost over runs and inflation associated with fixed price  fixed time frame projects  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates of contract completion costs and dates 
because revenue is recognized only when consultants are working  operating results are adversely affected when client facilities are closed due to holidays or inclement weather 
the company experiences a certain amount of seasonality in the quarter ended the last saturday in december due to the number of holidays falling in the quarter and shutdowns by certain customers for the holiday week 
in addition  lower gross margins are experienced in the first quarter of the calendar year due primarily to the timing of unemployment tax accruals and  to a lesser extent  social security taxes 
revenue growth is achieved by increasing the number of projects or consultants on engagements and  to a lesser extent  by increasing average bill rates 
gross margin increases are achieved primarily by increasing the utilization of the salaried consultants  and to a lesser extent  by increasing the bill rates of hourly consultants and increasing the amount of revenue generated by the business strategy and solutions groups 
the business strategy and solutions groups generally obtain higher gross margin percentages than the itcs group for a variety of reasons 
as a result of the number of acquisitions and expansion since june  the company has increased its it  human resources  legal  marketing and finance infrastructure and expanded the number and size of branch facilities to accommodate growth 
these measures have resulted in increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
delays in integrating the back office operations of certain acquisitions have resulted in some redundant expenditures  increasing selling  general and administrative expenses 
in january  the company consolidated certain back office operations in order to reduce these expenditures and streamline processes 
the company is currently reviewing its it infrastructure for year considerations and capacity given the recent growth and anticipated growth in the next five years 
the company is also converting its enterprise wide financial and human resource systems to the peoplesoft system 
the company expects a significant benefit by conforming all accounting and human resource systems to peoplesoft  allowing for additional capacity without additional headcount  a reduction of manual input  as well as expanded and more timely reporting of financial information 
the company is staffing the peoplesoft project internally 
while using internal resources reduces the overall costs of this project  the company will experience some decrease in the billable utilization of its consultants as a result of using these resources on internal projects 
recent acquisitions in march the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired all of the outstanding stock of neoglyphics media corporation neoglyphics 
neoglyphics is an internet development and applications company based in chicago  illinois and is the foundation of the e commerce business unit within the enterprise solutions group 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  each share of neoglyphics was converted into the right to receive 
shares of renaissance common stock 
renaissance also assumed outstanding options for the purchase of neoglyphics common stock at the same conversion ratio 
in april the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired all of the outstanding stock of triad data  inc triad 
triad is an information technology consulting firm performing services similar to those of the itcs group of the company 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  each share of triad common stock was converted into the right to receive  shares of renaissance common stock 
in total  shares of the company s common stock were exchanged for all of the outstanding common stock of neoglyphics and triad 
in addition  outstanding stock options to purchase neoglyphics common stock were converted into options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
these transactions have been accounted for as poolings of interests and  therefore  the financial statements of the company have been restated to include the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of these two companies for all periods presented 
the company incurred million in acquisition related expenses in the second quarter of related to these transactions 
in addition  in fiscal  the company acquired three companies accounted for as purchases exad galons  hackenberg and partners  and ipat 
renaissance paid an aggregate of million in cash for these acquisitions 
in addition  the company may be obligated to pay contingent cash consideration over the next three years based upon the future operating results of the acquired entities 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values as of the respective dates of acquisition 
the excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill 
the results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in renaissance s results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition

during the october to december quarter  the number of holidays and vacation days marginally reduces revenue 
some clients also close operations completely during the last week of the year 
renaissance also experiences a lower operating profit margin in the january to march quarter  in part as a result of higher unemployment tax accruals and  to a lesser extent  fica taxes which are expensed as incurred 
during this quarter  the unemployment tax  which is based on the first  of wages for each employee  depending on the state  is significantly higher than other quarters 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a line of credit facility in place which provides a borrowing base of of eligible accounts receivable as defined  up to a maximum borrowing of million  payable on demand 
interest is payable monthly in arrears at the bank s prime rate plus 
at june   at december   and at december  or the libor rate plus at june   at december   and at december   at the option of the company 
the line of credit is collateralized by all of the assets of the company  excluding the assets of the trust  contains certain restrictions  including limitations on the amount of distributions which can be made to stockholders  purchases of fixed assets  and loans which can be made to officers  and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
this line of credit was scheduled to expire in february but was extended

interest is payable monthly in arrears at the libor rate plus on the higher of the bank s prime rate or the fed funds rate plus  plus  at the company s option 
the line is collateralized by all of the assets of the company  contains certain restrictions  and requires maintenance of certain financial covenants 
the new line of credit is for a day term until syndication of a senior credit facility committed to by the bank consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million three year term loan facility is executed 
the company will incur certain underwriting and commitment fees in the first quarter of fiscal upon funding of this line as well as termination fees with the former bank upon payoff of the former line 
as of december   there was million outstanding with availability of million 
the line of credit bears an interest rate of libor plus or the bank of new york alternate base rate plus at the company s option 
the company experienced negative cash flows from operations of million for the fiscal year ended december  the negative operating cash flows during this period are primarily due to a million increase in gross accounts receivable during the period 
this increase was attributable primarily to increased revenues 
additionally  cash flows from operations were impacted by fluctuations in current and other assets and payable balances between the periods and changes in deferred taxes in the period 
the operating cash flow decreases were mitigated by an million increase in accrued expenses due primarily to acquisition related and restructuring accruals and end of year bonus accruals 
the company had negative cash flows from investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended december  the primary uses of cash for investing activities in the period were million paid for acquisitions and million in fixed asset purchases 
this was mitigated by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million in the period 
the company had cash provided by financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended december  the primary sources of cash from financing activities were million in net borrowings on the company s lines of credit and million of cash received from employees to purchase stock or exercise options 
the company anticipates that its primary uses of working capital in future periods will be for funding growth  either through acquisitions  the internal development of existing branch offices or the development of new branch offices and service offerings 
the company also anticipates making approximately million in capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily related to information systems 
in connection with certain of its acquisitions  the company may be obligated to make certain contingent payments over the next several years  including million which the company currently is required to pay over the next months 
the company does not believe that such payments would have a material impact on the company s liquidity  results of operations or capital requirements 
the company s principal capital requirement is working capital to support the accounts receivable associated with its revenue growth 
the company believes that its new financing from bank of america  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s presently anticipated working capital needs for at least the next months 
foreign currency fluctuations and inflation did not have a significant impact on the company for any of the periods presented 
impact of the year issues the year problem arose because many computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  date sensitive software or hardware may not be able to distinguish between and and programs that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting of date fields may begin yielding incorrect results 
the year problem could potentially cause a system failure or miscalculations that could disrupt the company s operations 
the company s state of readiness 
the company has developed a year remediation plan that involves three overlapping phases 
in the catalog phase  the company has created an index of year issues broken down into three functional areas 
applications and information technology it equipment this area includes all mainframe  network and desktop hardware and software  including custom and packaged applications  and it embedded systems 

non information technology non it embedded systems these systems include non it equipment and machinery 
non it embedded systems  such as security  fire prevention and climate control systems  typically include embedded technology  such as microcontrollers 

vendor and customer relationships these include significant third party vendors and suppliers of goods and services  as well as vendor and supplier interfaces 
these also include customers of the company s products and services as well as customer interfaces and accounts receivable 
the company completed the catalog phase in april of in the analysis phase  the company evaluated the catalogued items for year compliance  determining the remediation method and resources required and developing an implementation plan 
the company completed the analysis phase in april in the implementation phase  the company will execute the implementation plan for all applicable hardware and software  interfaces and systems 
this phase will involve replacing certain software and hardware not being upgraded  testing the implemented changes  using the changed procedures in actual operations  testing in a year simulated environment and vendor and customer interface testing 
after implementation  the company intends to conduct live testing commencing in the second quarter all components of the implementation phase are expected to be completed by october  the company s remediation plan for its year issues is an ongoing process and the estimated completion dates above are subject to change 
the risk of the company s year issues 
generally  the company has completed an assessment of year issues with respect to its business systems and has already begun to take actions to ensure their compliance 
plans and associated milestones are being executed to ensure that those business systems not currently certified as compliant are either upgraded to certified status or replaced well in advance of december  based on the completed assessment  management does not expect that the costs of bringing the company s systems into compliance with year to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company does not believe that it is subject to significant business risks related to its customers and suppliers year efforts 
the company s contingency plans 
the company does not currently have contingency plans with respect to the year problem 
if the company s implementation efforts fail or are no longer on schedule for completion the company will divert its resources to contingency planning 
costs to address the company s year issue 
the total cost of the company s remediation plan is estimated at approximately  to  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total cost  approximately  is attributable to new hardware and software that will be capitalized 
the remainder will be expensed as incurred 
it is impossible for the company to completely account for the costs incurred in its remediation effort as many of its employees have focused and will continue to focus significant efforts in evaluating the company s year state of readiness and in remediating problems that have arisen  and will continue to arise  from such evaluation 
consultants internal work for the company negatively impacts the company s ability to employ its consultants on billable projects externally which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
factors that may affect future results we have divided the following discussion of factors that may affect the future results of our business between those that relate specifically to our company and those that relate to companies in the it services industry 
risks relating specifically to our company our inability to manage growth could adversely affect our operating results the significant growth of our business in recent years has placed significant demands on our managerial and other resources 
our ability to manage this growth effectively will require us to continue to improve our operating  financial and other internal systems 
we will also have to improve our business development capabilities and train  motivate and manage an increasing number of employees 
we currently rely on several different financial reporting systems to monitor and manage our financial performance 
these multiple systems are both inefficient and difficult to operate 
we are implementing a new single financial reporting system  but that system is not yet in place 
if we fail to implement this new system effectively or if we have difficulty transitioning to the new system  we will have difficulty managing the business  which could adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
the significant growth in our business since june of has been coupled with significant increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
specifically  such expenses increased from the fiscal year ended june to the fiscal year ended june such expenses increased from the six month period ended december to the six month period ended december and from the year ended december to the year ended december our failure to effectively control and curb the significant increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses could adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
acquisitions involve many financial uncertainties as well as personnel contingencies and therefore can be risky and difficult to integrate we have completed more than twenty acquisitions in the last two years 
acquisitions continue to be part of our growth strategy 
acquired businesses do not always generate the revenues or earnings that we thought they would and occasionally we find that they have unknown or undisclosed liabilities 
when these situations occur  the company s business is adversely affected 
we only receive the anticipated benefits from an acquisition when we successfully integrate it into our own business in a timely and non disruptive manner 
integration requires substantial management attention 
difficulties we encounter integrating an acquired business can have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively  key employees of that business may leave  which can further complicate our integration efforts and jeopardize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
we depend on our relationship with peoplesoft the hunter group  the principal business in the enterprise solutions business unit  derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from its relationship with peoplesoft  a provider of enterprise resource planning software that addresses broad functional areas such as human resources  finance  treasury and project management 
because the hunter group contributes a significant proportion of our operating profits  we are in part dependent on peoplesoft s continued success 
an adverse change in the hunter group s relationship with peoplesoft could adversely affect our operating results 
any changes in peoplesoft sponsored programs or a loss of peoplesoft certifications would adversely affect our business by reducing the number of client referrals and peoplesoft engagements 
our operating results fluctuate and our business is slightly seasonal our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of many different factors  including the number  significance  mix and timing of client projects  the number of business days in a particular period  and general economic conditions 
as our solutions business unit  which provides services principally on a project by project basis  grows and contributes a greater percentage of our revenues  we expect that greater variability in quarterly operating results may occur 
our business is also somewhat seasonal 
we experience this seasonality in the fourth quarter because of an increased number of holidays in that quarter 
investors should not rely on operating results in any one quarter as an indicator of our future results 
doing business internationally involves additional risks unique to foreign operations we recruit consultants and generate a portion of our revenues from outside the united states 
foreign operations are subject  however  to special risks that can adversely affect revenues and profits 
these risks include 
currency exchange rate fluctuations 
tariff and trade barriers 
labor strikes 
immigration laws and regulations 
political and economic disruptions 
potentially adverse tax 
changes in government consequences policies and regulatory 
exchange controls requirements two officers control a substantial amount of our common stock more than of our common stock is held by mr 
conway  our chairman and chief executive officer  and mr 
hunter  president of the hunter group and a director 
as a result  messrs 
conway and hunter would be able to significantly influence any matter requiring stockholder approval 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company and may discourage third parties from attempting to do so 
future sales of substantial amounts of this common stock  or the potential for such sales  may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 
risks relating to the information technology services industry all providers of it services face similar risks and we are no exception 
we discuss below the significant risks and how they affect our business 
our business depends on attracting and retaining qualified it professionals who are in high demand our business and future growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain experienced and skilled management consultants  it professionals and it project managers 
competition for these professionals is intense because the demand for them is greater than their current availability 
despite our best efforts  not all of our professionals will always be satisfied with our culture  compensation and benefits 
this problem can be particularly troublesome with professionals of an acquired business who may have come from a corporate culture that is different than our s 
there is great mobility among the employees that we need to attract 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
they may offer these individuals more attractive compensation and benefits packages 
if we do not recruit  train and maintain a sufficient number of professional personnel  we will not be able to satisfy our clients demands for it services and our business will be adversely affected 
it projects are complex and subject us to non payment and other financial risk many of our it projects subject us to financial risks 
these engagements often involve critical business processes and leading edge software applications 
despite our best efforts  we may not always be able to satisfy a customer s expectations because software applications do not always work as expected 
a customer s dissatisfaction could affect its willingness to pay us for these services  which would result in a financial loss on that project 
customer dissatisfaction can also damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to attract new business 
even in situations where the scope of a project changes  as a result of customer demands or otherwise  we may not always be successful in obtaining a price adjustment as large as the one we seek 
to the extent that projects are extended or enlarged without corresponding changes in fee schedules  our business would be adversely affected 
failure to remediate year problems could lead to liability claims some of our clients have hired us to evaluate and remedy their year problem 
many of these engagements involve projects that are critical to the client s operations and business 
despite our best efforts  because the year problem is complex and because it is often associated with critical client systems or processes  we may be subject to claims from clients that we failed properly to evaluate or remedy the client s year problem 
in addition  we have written software code and performed services for our clients in the past that may still be in use but are not year compliant 
such past efforts may subject us to claims similar to those mentioned above despite the fact that we were not engaged to evaluate or remedy the clients year problems 
any claims with respect to year problems  whether meritorious or not  may adversely affect our business 
demand for our it services may decline after as the year approaches  many companies are evaluating their it systems to decide whether to repair or replace applications that have year operability issues 
although we believe that these evaluations are increasing the demand for our services in the short term  this demand will likely dissipate as year issues are resolved 
given the lack of precedent for an issue of this magnitude  we cannot accurately forecast the effect of this issue on quarter to quarter revenue achievement and our failure to estimate this forecast accurately could adversely affect our business 
because we depend on key clients and have no long term agreements the loss of a key client or clients would be significant although none of our clients accounts for more than of the our revenues  the successive loss of one or more of our significant clients may adversely affect our business 
in addition  we face pricing pressure from large clients who often seek reduced prices for a desired volume of business or from clients with whom we wish to maintain a preferred vendor status 
further  in virtually all cases a client can terminate our services agreements on short notice and without any penalty 
if a number of these cancellations were to occur in a short time period  our business and operating results would be adversely affected in the short run 
our business is subject to fluctuations in the general health of the economy demand for it consulting services will be affected by the general health of the domestic and international economies
