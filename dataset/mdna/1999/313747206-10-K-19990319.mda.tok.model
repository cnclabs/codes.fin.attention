the trust has historically reported its funds from operations in addition to its net income and net cash provided by operating activities

funds from operations does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity

most retail tenants pay a majority of on site operating expenses and real estate taxes 
many leases also contain a percentage rent clause which calls for additional rents based on tenant sales 
these features in the trust leases reduce the trust s exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow it to participate in improved tenant sales 
consolidated results vs 
rental income  which consists of minimum rent  percentage rent and cost recoveries  increased or million from million in to million in if properties acquired and sold in and are excluded  rental income increased  due primarily to the favorable impact of redeveloped and retenanted centers and to higher percentage rent 
other property income includes items which  although recurring  tend to fluctuate from period to period  such as utility reimbursements  telephone income  merchant association dues  late fees  and temporary tenant income 
also included are less regularly recurring items  such as lease termination fees

if rental expenses are adjusted for properties acquired and sold in and  rental expenses are constant at million 
decreases in environmental expenses and common area expenses such as snow removal were offset by increases in bad debt expense which had been unusually low in due to the recovery in of amounts written off in prior years 
real estate taxes increased from to million in  due to the and acquisitions 
if real estate taxes are adjusted for properties acquired and sold in and  real estate taxes increased due primarily to increased taxes on recently redeveloped properties 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased from to million in reflecting the impact of properties acquired in and and of recent tenant work and property improvements 
in the trust incurred interest expense of million  of which million was capitalized  as compared to s million  of which million was capitalized 
the increase in interest expense reflects the additional debt issued to fund the trust s approximately million of real estate investments made in the weighted average interest rate was in compared with in the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was x in and x in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was x in and x in the ratio of funds from operations to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was x in and x in administrative expenses in reflect the adoption of the emerging issues task force eitf issue  which requires the expensing of internal costs of acquisition activities beginning in late march prior to this date  such costs were capitalized as a component of the basis of the acquired asset 
the increase in administrative expenses from million in to million in is substantially due to its adoption

the charge included a provision for employee severance and related costs  office closing and downsizing expenses  as well as legal and consulting fees related to the restructuring program 
the trust s workforce was reduced by approximately including several vice presidents and other senior personnel 
the foundation of the restructuring effort focused on a change in the trust s operating model from a functional hierarchy to an asset management discipline where small focused teams are responsible for and compensated based on the operating performance of a portfolio of assets 
in addition  the restructuring effort included a significant downsizing of the trust s acquisition department  in response to changing market conditions and business emphasis 
in the trust incurred million of costs associated with severance and other expenses related to changes in the trust s executive management 
investors share of operations represents the minority interest in the income of certain properties 
the increase from million in to million in is primarily due to the income attributable to the operating partnership units issued upon the acquisition of courthouse  magruder s  kings court and leesburg plaza shopping centers in late and and due to the minority partners share of the increased earnings in congressional plaza 
as a result of the foregoing items  net income before gain on sale of real estate increased from million in to million in  reflecting not only the contribution to net income from the trust s acquisitions  but also the contribution from improved results of the core portfolio 
net income  including gain on sale of real estate  decreased from million in to million in in three shopping centers were sold at a net gain of million 
net income available for common shareholders decreased from million in to million in  due to a full year of preferred dividends in of million compared with a partial year in of million since the million of series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares were issued in october the trust expects growth in net income in both from contributions of acquisitions and from contributions of its core portfolio  primarily the properties undergoing redevelopment and retenanting 
however  growth of net income from the core portfolio is  in part  dependent on controlling expenses  some of which are beyond the complete control of the trust  such as snow removal and trends in the retailing environment 
the trust currently expects that demand for its retail space should remain at levels similar to those in a weakening of the retail environment could  however  adversely impact the trust by increasing vacancies and decreasing rents 
in past weak retail and real estate environments  the trust has been able to replace weak and bankrupt tenants with stronger tenants  management believes that due to the quality of the trust s properties there will continue to be demand for its space 
growth in net income is also dependent on interest rates and controlling administrative costs 
if interest rates increase  net income  as well as the ultimate cost of the trust s development projects will be negatively impacted due to the variable interest rates on the trust s revolving credit facilities 
the trust is aggressively managing its administrative expenses through its reorganization efforts

interest income increased from to million in  due to the issuance of million and million  respectively  of mortgage notes receivable in and in the trust incurred interest expense of million  of which million was capitalized  as compared to s million of which  was capitalized 
the increase in interest expense reflects the additional debt issued to help fund the trust s approximately million of real estate investments made in the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was x in  there were no preferred dividends in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was x in and x in the ratio of funds from operations to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was x in  there were no preferred dividends in administrative expenses increased from to million in primarily due to increased personnel costs as the trust grew and as it accelerated its acquisition and development efforts in administrative expenses as a percentage of total income  however  dropped from in to in in the trust incurred million of costs associated with severance and other expenses related to changes in the trust s executive management

a significant portion of this portfolio has been held by the trust for many years although acquisitions  redevelopment and retenanting remain major components to the current and future performance of the region
