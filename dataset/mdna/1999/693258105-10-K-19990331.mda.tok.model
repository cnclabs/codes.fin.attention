the decrease in gross margin was due to significantly lower repair service margins in  which were the result of initiating several major customer relationships  as well as a increase in the repair business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues rose to in from in the primary reasons for this increase were a deficiencies in the freight monitoring  control and billing process  which were identified and corrected in the second quarter of  b increased personnel related costs for the conversion of the company s automated warehouse management system  c a charge related to a discontinued  unprofitable warranty processing program  d changes related to management s review and modification of the policies  procedures and methodologies for valuing the company s assets and liabilities and e increased occupancy costs primarily related to the repair services operations 
during the fourth quarter  the company reviewed its various customer programs and segmented those programs based on customer requirements 
specific service levels  business terms and conditions and targeted profit levels were identified  implemented and established for each customer category 
management believes that the segmentation of customers and expense reduction programs should reduce selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues in restructuring charges totaled as a percent of net revenues in the charges totalled million in connection with the consolidation of the company s west coast repair facility into its irving  texas facility which included future lease commitments  severance and the write off of goodwill associated with the west coast operations 
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of net revenues to in compared to in this increase was due to the capital expenditures and recognizing a full year of depreciation on the significant capital expenditures 
net interest expense increased slightly in to of net revenues over of net revenues in the increase is attributable to significantly greater average borrowings during versus year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company recognized nearly a increase in net revenues for the year ended december   with million in revenues compared to million for the year ended december  all components of revenue contributed to the increase 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues declined from in to in the reduction in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was due to a decision to reduce the number of parts offered for sale on an exchange basis from approximately  skus to less than  skus 
this shift was made in recognition of the improvements made in the company s programs to acquire remanufactured  or used parts  as many of the parts formerly offered for sale as an exchange are now available as a remanufactured part 
the gross margin decline resulted from the inventory value of the exchange parts  many of which were new when acquired  being substantially in excess of their market value as a remanufactured part 
had this shift in inventory product mix not taken place  gross margin as a percentage of revenue would have been consistent with selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues rose from in to in the primary reasons for this increase were the hiring  training and development of personnel needed to support the increase in business mainly in the call center and distribution center  and additions to senior management necessary to grow and improve the business 
management does not believe this level of selling  general and administrative expenses is appropriate over the long term 
however  to meet expected revenue growth pcss must hire associates in anticipation of additional revenue as the period to recruit  hire and train account representatives can be six weeks or more 
the company experienced fluctuating average daily revenues throughout which made forecasting revenue  as well as required manning  difficult 
pcss is pursuing a number of productivity initiatives to lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues in  including a new warehouse management system  expected to be operational in the first quarter  a call center activity monitoring system and a review of the company s various customer programs to discontinue those which do not generate an appropriate profit margin 
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of net revenues to in compared to in this increase was due to recognizing a full years depreciation on the significant capital expenditures made in and interest expense net increased slightly in to

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
application of this accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
year the company s management recognizes the need to ensure that its operations and relationships with vendors  customers and other third parties will not be adversely impacted by the year issue 
the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
based on its assessment  the company determined a portion of its software and certain hardware will require modification or replacement so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  although the company s assessment indicated that the significant information technology systems would not be affected  that assessment however  indicated that the software and hardware used in the company s telephone equipment would be at risk 
the affected systems are the company s primary sources of receiving customer orders 
except for the telephone equipment  which will be replaced in  the company believes it has mitigated the year issue by modifying or replacing the affected hardware and software 
the company has also established a program to review its product line and identify date sensitive parts and the level of year compliance that the part supports 
this program is to ensure that customers receive products that are year compliant  or at a minimum  are made aware of products that are not compliant 
the company also depends on the systems of its suppliers and customers 
consequently  the company is in the process of receiving adequate assurances from its suppliers and customers that those systems on which the company relies are or will be year compliant before the end of to the extent possible  the company will develop and implement contingency plans designed to allow continued operations in the event of failure of the company s or third party systems to be year compliant 
these contingency plans have been developed and are expected to be implemented by the end of management estimates that the total cost of the above initiatives to be  the company is expensing all costs associated with these systems changes as the costs are incurred 
as of december   approximately  has been expensed 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
should the critical applications fail to perform properly in response to the year issue  the company could be unable to receive and ship a substantial number of orders received by its telephone systems 
the amount of potential lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
further  the failure of the company or third parties upon which the company relies  to identify year issues and successfully and timely resolve them could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations and the financial condition of the company
