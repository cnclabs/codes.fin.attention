year compliance many computers  software programs and microprocessors embedded in certain equipment collectively  systems were designed to accommodate only two digit date fields to represent a given year eg  represents 
it is possible that such systems will not be able to accurately process data containing information relating to dates before  during or after the year it is possible that such systems could fail entirely  although in many instances the consequences of a system not being year complaint are unknown 
in response to this issue  the company has evaluated its applications and operating software and is in the process of evaluating its hardware and software products  end user computing activities  third party data exchanges and business relationships  and has established a project team responsible for overseeing progress on the company s compliance program and periodically reporting to management 
as of december  the company has completed approximately of its efforts to bring its own applications software and hardware in compliance  with the objective of having all critical production systems year compliant by the middle of testing of critical applications is being accomplished through the use of a special system testing environment that simulates system operations in the year the company also purchased and implemented new operational and accounting software in in addition to being year compliant  these new systems are intended to add increased functionality to the company 
the company has completed its assessment of its servers and client server operating software 
the results of this assessment were identification of hardware and software issues requiring remediation in order to assure year compliance 
the total cost both current and future to modify these existing production systems  which includes both internal and external costs of programming  coding and testing is estimated to be  and has been reflected in the financial statements 
in addition to addressing hardware software information technology it  the company has also been assessing year issues with respect to non it systems such as telephones and various building services which may rely on embedded microprocessors 
although failure of non it systems such as telephone service could disrupt the company s business  the company s communications with the relevant vendors have not identified any significant year problems 
the company believes that if systems were not complaint for year related problems there could be a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
the company believes that it is taking the necessary measures to address issues that may arise relating to year related problems and that its systems should be compliant 
the company realizes  however  that non compliance by these parties could impact its business 
the company s plan addresses potential year issues related to the processing of transactions with third parties 
the possibility exists that some of the company s external business contacts may not be compliant 
the company began contacting its external business contacts and continues to do so to determine their status of compliance and to assess the impact of noncompliance to the company 
the company is working closely with all critical business relationships to minimize its exposure to year related problems 
it should be noted  however  that there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies will be year compliant  or that their conversion will be comparable with information included in the company s systems without having a material adverse effect on the company 
although it has considered various scenarios concerning the possible effects of the year issue  the company does not have formal contingency plans relating to either its internal processing environment or its external business contacts 
as it completes the upgrading and testing of non compliant systems and continues to monitor the status of its important external contacts into mid  the company will develop contingency plans if deemed necessary for critical systems and relationships 
a comprehensive review was performed by the company of the insurance policies written by its insurance companies and their underwriting guidelines to determine year exposure 
the insurance companies primarily issue policies covering all or part of an insured s self insured retention  with limits generally up to  that follow the form of the policies for coverage in excess of the insurance companies policies 
the insurance companies have not issued exclusions on these policies 
the insurance companies have also issued a number of policies with greater limits of coverage  and have included a year exclusion on such policies 
the company is aware that year liabilities may be deemed not to be fortuitous in nature and  therefore  not covered under the policies underwritten by the insurance companies 
moreover  based upon the classes of insurance primarily underwritten by the insurance companies  the company believes that its coverage exposure with respect to year losses will not be material 
however  changes in social and legal trends may establish coverage unintended for year exposures by re interpreting insurance contracts and exclusions
