the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the rps division s net book value of assets at september   as adjusted  which is estimated to approximate fair value 
the purchase price allocated under this assumption exceeded the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired by approximately million  which is recognized as goodwill and is being amortized over forty years 
the current purchase price allocation is preliminary due to the timing of the acquisition relative to the company s year end 
a more precise allocation of purchase price is currently being performed at various rps division locations to more accurately identify and value the assets  including intangibles  and liabilities assumed

also on september   the company completed the repurchase of the final million of senior subordinated notes due the notes that were then outstanding 
these notes were redeemed at an aggregate premium and consent payment of million along with accrued interest of million 
the premium and consent payment was aggregated with the write off of the remaining deferred issuance costs related to the notes and the old credit agreement and reported as an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in march  the company completed an offering of  shares of its common stock the common stock offering 
net proceeds from the common stock offering totaled approximately million

the company acquired sofitam in september for million less certain adjustments 
the company s financial statements include three months of sofitam operations  and the and financial statements include a full year of sofitam operations 
a comparison of sales in versus of entities that were part of tokheim before the acquisition is not meaningful because certain sales made by these entities were conducted through sofitam in and international sales by foreign subsidiaries and exports from the us totaled approximately   and of consolidated net sales in   and  respectively 
the acquisition of sofitam has significantly extended the company s international distribution network  reducing its reliance on us domestic sales 
furthermore the acquisition of the rps division will significantly increase the percentage of international sales in relation to future consolidated sales 
in december  the company acquired management solutions  inc msi 
msi develops and distributes retail automation systems including pos software  primarily for the convenience store  petroleum dispensing and fast food service industries 
the company paid msi s stockholders an initial amount of million

the million consists of million of additional purchase price  million related to a non compete agreement  and million of additional employee compensation 
the company borrowed funds for the initial purchase price under the old credit agreement 
results of operations net sales for were million 
net sales excluding the current year acquisitions of msi and the rps division the acquisitions were million as compared to million in after excluding the effects of the acquisitions  net sales for increased by from levels 
sales for north america  excluding export sales  increased from million in to million in this increase was driven by a stronger demand in the company s retail distribution  commercial dispensers and service parts sales 
this demand was driven by new  more convenient products  such as credit debit card readers  and environmental regulations  such as those requiring vapor recovery systems 
during the current year the oil industry had various major oil companies merge together 
it is currently unknown what the effect  if any  of these mergers will have on the company s future sales levels or operations 
international sales  including domestic export sales  were million in compared to million in  representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease is due in part to the continued decline in foreign currency exchange rates from prior year levels 
international sales would have been million higher if average exchange rates of european and african currencies remained consistent with rates 
the other major contributing factor is a significant decline in current year domestic export sales to the asia pacific and middle east regions compared to prior year levels 
the depressed sales to the asia pacific region compared to prior year levels has been caused by a significant economic downturn in that regions economy 
there can be no assurance as to when asian market conditions will improve or whether they may worsen or spread to other regions 
net sales for were million  an increase of from sales of million 
substantially all of this increase was due to the inclusion of a full year of sofitam s results in compared to three months of sofitam s results in these increases were offset by the impact of a decline in revenues due to a decline in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales for would have been million higher if average exchange rates of european and african currencies had remained the same as in gross margin as a percent of sales defined as net sales less cost of sales  divided by net sales was in compared to in this decline is due to the historically lower gross margins in the rps division s business  offset partially by manufacturing improvements made in certain of the company s operations 
during the fort wayne  indiana manufacturing facility implemented operational improvements 
the company s operational excellence strategy provides an integrated process resulting in what the company believes is a true world class manufacturing facility 
this comprehensive approach utilizes advanced operations techniques encompassing lean manufacturing  six sigma quality  high performance organizations  supplier partnerships  advanced materials management and strategies to gain the maximum amount of operational efficiencies 
once fully implemented at the fort wayne  indiana facility  these same techniques will be implemented in all other manufacturing facilities 
gross margin for was  up from in this increase is due to i the inclusion of sofitam s operations at higher margin levels for a full year  ii personnel reductions and related cost savings  iii reduction of warranty expense in north america  and iv the results of concentrated efforts to improve manufacturing efficiencies globally 
these cost reductions were offset somewhat by decreasing sales prices 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net sales was for after removing the effects of the acquisitions sg a was or million in compared to or million in the slight increase in dollars is primarily attributed to increased costs associated with year corrective actions and increased incentive compensation related to sales and earnings performance 
sg a was or million in  compared to or million in this increase over is largely attributable to a full year of sofitam expenses 
these increases were offset by a program implemented by the company in to improve efficiency and reduce personnel  which translated into lower total compensation cost 
net interest expense increased in to million from million in this increase is the direct result of higher levels of debt incurred to effect the acquisition of the rps division 
net interest expense increased in to million from million in  reflecting a full year s interest expense on the company s senior subordinated notes due issued to finance the acquisition of sofitam 
a net foreign currency exchange gain of million was realized in compared to a net currency loss of less than million in and a net currency loss of million in during the second quarter of the company realized a foreign currency gain of million associated with the repayment of various french franc denominated borrowings previously entered into under the company s old credit agreement 
due to the decline in the value of the french franc  the company was able to repay these borrowings with less us dollars than it had received when the original contracts were entered into 
during the fourth quarter of the company settled a foreign denominated obligation which resulted in a foreign currency gain of million 
the currency loss was due principally to the decline of the french franc against the us dollar and was partially offset by a foreign currency gain of million on the sale of a foreign currency option contract 
other income  net was million in compared to million in this decrease is principally due to lower gains realized on the sale of property  plant and equipment 
other income  net was million in compared to million in this increase is partly due to gains on the sale of property  plant and equipment that were million greater in than and to the inclusion of sofitam s other income for the full year 
in addition  other income in of million includes million of expense for a litigation settlement of a non operating nature 
income tax expense for was million  which is comparable with the prior year 
as in prior years  the majority of this amount is comprised of foreign taxes and us state taxes 
the company s domestic and foreign operations benefit from the use of net operating loss carryforwards generated in prior years 
income tax expense for was million  an increase from million in the increase was due to higher income  offset partially by utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and adjustments of prior year s taxes and refunds 
at the end of  the company recorded a net deferred tax asset of million  which was offset in full by a valuation allowance due largely to uncertainties associated with the company s ability to fully use these tax benefits 
the company is continuing to evaluate the likelihood that all or part of the deferred tax asset will be realized through the generation of future taxable earnings 
if  in the future  the company is able to generate sufficient levels of taxable income  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly

in december  the company initiated its year plan  including the organization and staffing of a full time year program office 
the company has organized the process into the following sections product certification ensuring all products sold by the company are year ready  internal information systems ensuring all internal hardware and software is year ready through upgrades or replacement  suppliers  distributors and external agents ensuring all suppliers  distributors and external agents used by the company to purchase or sell goods and services are year ready  and manufacturing and infrastructure ensuring manufacturing and infrastructure systems are year ready 
as of december  most of the company s products worldwide had been tested for year readiness 
a substantial majority of the company s total product lines are year ready  and the company believes that the remaining products will be year ready by december the company s products presently being sold are year ready 
the company is currently assessing which products in the field are not year ready and its responsibility to the customers  if any  to remedy non compliant products 
this assessment is being done for all products sold by each entity with the assessment efforts focused on the recently acquired rps division locations 
there is a possibility that certain third party networks over which the pos systems must operate may not be year ready  but the company s products will still allow the pumping of petroleum products 
the company has surveyed its critical suppliers  and about half of the respondents have indicated that they are year ready 
the other half of those responding have indicated that they are still working to achieve year readiness  but none has indicated that it expects not to be ready 
the company believes that all of its information systems will be year ready no later than the third quarter of to date  the company has not uncovered any material year problems 
the total costs associated with required modifications to become year ready are not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company estimates that it will spend a total of approximately million by december   of which approximately million had been spent by november   to become year ready 
the company has enlisted the assistance of a third party consulting company to provide independent verification and validation of its entire year plan 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operation  liquidity  and financial condition 
the company believes that the most likely failure scenario is that its pos systems that have not been corrected may fail  but the company s dispensers will still allow the pumping of petroleum products 
under such a scenario  purchasers of petroleum products would still be able to use the dispensers but would be required to pay for their purchases at the cashier rather than at the pump 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  customers  and devices that interface with the company s products  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
the year plan is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year readiness of its material external agents 
the company believes that with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the year plan as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
however  contingency planning for all sections discussed above commenced in the fourth quarter of  and the company is currently focusing on assessing the potential year problems that may arise and the risks of not becoming year ready for each section mentioned 
the company expects to have a contingency plan in place by the end of the second quarter of the future the company s principal sources of liquidity in the future are expected to be cash flow from operations  including cash flow anticipated to be generated from the recently acquired rps division  and available borrowings under the new credit agreement 
it is expected that the company s principal uses of liquidity will be to provide working capital  finance capital expenditures  fund costs associated with the company s integration and rationalization plan and meet debt service requirements 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has a significant level of debt 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated cost savings and future growth  the company believes that its expected cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under the new credit agreement and its other sources of liquidity  including leases  will be adequate to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  lease payments and scheduled principal and interest payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels  that estimated cost savings or growth will be achieved or that the company will be able to refinance its existing indebtedness in whole or in part 
the indentures under which the dollar notes and the euro notes were issued the indentures and the new credit agreement contain a number of significant covenants 
the new credit agreement requires the company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial tests 
the company s ability to meet such financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet such financial ratios and tests 
in addition  the indentures limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends on capital stock or repurchase capital stock or make certain other restricted payments  use the proceeds of certain asset sales  make certain investments  create liens on assets to secure debt  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with another company  and transfer and sell assets 
new accounting pronouncements the company has considered the impact that accounting pronouncements recently issued by the financial accounting standards board and american institute of certified public accountants will have on the consolidated financial statements as of november  none of the pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted by the company are expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements
