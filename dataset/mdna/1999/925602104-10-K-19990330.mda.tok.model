item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vical was incorporated in april and since that time has devoted substantially all of its resources to its research and development programs 
we are focusing our resources on the development of our direct gene transfer and related technologies 
to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of products 
we cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable at all or on a sustained basis 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
vical expects to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years due to significant increases in research and development expenses 
the increases are expected to result from costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates  increased patent and regulatory costs  and associated increases in personnel  laboratory supplies  contract services and facilities 
losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and the revenues received from collaborative agreements 
such fluctuations may be significant

results of operations vical had revenues of million for the year ended december   compared with million in and million in license revenues in consisted of million from centocor  inc for an agreement covering technology for the potential treatment of some types of cancer  million from an agreement with boston scientific corporation for the development of catheter based vascular gene therapy  recognition of 
million of deferred license fees from a further extension of the license and option agreement with merial  royalty revenues of 
million and 
million of other license revenue 
contract revenues in consisted principally of 
million from an agreement with the office of naval research for the development work on a potential dna vaccine to prevent malaria 
this agreement is a multi year agreement which could provide up to an additional million in revenues through contract revenue in also included 
million of reimbursements from pmc and other sources 
vical had revenues of million for the year ended december   compared with million in revenues in were composed of research and license revenue from a merck agreement covering certain growth factors million  the equity premium on the investment merck made in in vical common stock under an amendment to the collaborative agreement million  the pmc collaboration million  a collaborative agreement with rpr for neurodegenerative disease targets million  and other agreements which totaled million 
in november  vical and merck amended the agreement and granted merck rights to develop and market therapeutic vaccines against hiv and hbv 
under the november amendment  merck made an investment of million for approximately  shares of vical common stock 
the price per share reflected a twenty five percent premium over the trading price of the common stock 
the premium on the investment was reflected in revenue in the pmc revenue represented contract revenue of million as payment for clinical and preclinical work and license revenue of million  of which million was for a milestone payment for the start of the malaria clinical trial and the balance was the recognition of deferred license fees 
revenues in resulted from research and license revenue from the pmc collaboration in the amount of million  the merck agreement in the amount of million  the genzyme collaboration in the amount of million  and several other agreements in the amount of million 
revenue from the pmc agreement in was primarily the result of pmc s payment of licensing and option fees  and the addition of a new option  as well as the payment of fees for vical s performance of clinical and preclinical work 
the merck revenue resulted from milestone payments due under the merck agreement 
the genzyme collaboration income was the result of genzyme exercising its option to license our technology for the treatment of cystic fibrosis as well as payments for our performance of research and preclinical work 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increases in research and development expense were generally due to expansion of our research and development activities 
the increase in principally was due to increased clinical trial costs and additional royalty expense for license agreements 
the increase in expenses in compared to included increased clinical and preclinical efforts which resulted in increases to staffing  increased facilities related costs and increased expenditures on laboratory supplies 
clinical trials expense increased to million during from million in this increase was due to the commencement of the phase ii and phase iii clinical trials of allovectin for melanoma 
clinical trials expense increased to million during from million in primarily due to the commencement of the malaria clinical trial and increased clinical trials activity on leuvectin 
during  we incurred expenses of approximately million with the commencement and progression of the multi center phase i ii and phase ii clinical trials of leuvectin and allovectin respectively 
research and development expense is expected to increase in and thereafter as our preclinical and clinical trial activities increase 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in due to lower insurance and facilities expenses 
the increase to million in from million during was due primarily to additional staffing and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as research and development activities expand 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher rates of return on investments 
interest income of million during declined from the million in  due to lower investment balances as we redeemed investments to fund operating expenses 
interest expense decreased during due to lower capital lease obligations  lower balance of bank note payable and lower interest rates on the newer capital lease obligations 
interest expense increased in compared to the previous year due to increased capital lease obligations to finance equipment needs and the addition of a debt instrument in year issues the year problem is due to many computer systems using only two digits rather than four to designate a specific year 
as a result  many of these systems may fail to function properly if a date beyond is entered 
we have completed our assessment of any potential year issues for our internal computer applications  including embedded control systems in equipment  to determine whether they will function for the year and beyond and what modifications  if any  would be required to ensure their continuing functionality 
we plan to upgrade our existing business applications software to the latest year compliant release of the software by june  we also plan to implement a new financial and accounting system and related hardware to meet our growing needs into the near future 
this new system will be year compliant and implemented prior to yearend 
given the relatively small size of our systems and the predominantly new hardware  software and operating systems  we do not anticipate any significant delays in becoming year compliant 
to date our costs for year compliance have been immaterial and we expect our costs to finish becoming year compliant to be immaterial 
we are unable to control whether our current and future strategic partners systems are year compliant 
the failure of systems maintained by our strategic partners or suppliers could cause us to incur significant expenses to remedy any problems  or otherwise seriously damage our business 
we are communicating with strategic partners to assess the risk of year issues 
we have not completed the inquiries of the strategic partners 
however  we are not aware  at this time  of any material year issues regarding our dealings with our strategic partners 
we anticipate that our assessment will be completed by july  at this time  we have no reason to believe that year changes will have a material impact on vical s business  financial condition or results of operations 
since no significant issues have been identified  we do not have a comprehensive contingency plan to address any material year issues 
a contingency plan  if required  will be developed for all applications and systems that affect core business functions upon completion of our assessment of year issues 
we do plan to perform backups of the existing and upgraded versions of the computer system so that in the event our planned new financial and accounting system and related hardware do not function properly we can continue to operate under the old system 
vical has not identified what it believes would be a reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to year failures 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  vical has financed its operations primarily through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  three public offerings of common stock  and revenues from collaborative agreements 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million compared with million at december  cash and marketable securities totaled approximately million at december   compared with million at december  we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expense and general and administrative expense 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of scientific progress in our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  commercialization activities and arrangements and other factors not within our control 
we intend to seek additional funding through research and development relationships with suitable potential corporate collaborators and or through public or private financings 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if additional financing is not available  vical anticipates that our available cash and existing sources of funding will be adequate to satisfy our operating needs through at least item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk vical s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
no investments in equity securities are made 
at december   percent of the investments would mature within two years  none would mature beyond three years  and the average maturity was nine months 
our investments are all classified as available for sale securities 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
we projected an ending fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities using a twelve month time horizon  a nine month average maturity and assuming a basis point increase in interest rates 
the decrease in fair value assuming a basis point increase in interest rates compared with fair value with no change in interest rates was not material
