item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item legal proceedings litigation matters the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures are  from time to time  defendants in lawsuits  some of which are not covered by insurance 
many of these suits make no specific claim for relief 
although final determination of legal liability and the resulting financial impact with respect to any such litigation cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty  the company does not believe that any ultimate uninsured liability resulting from the legal proceedings in which it currently is involved directly or indirectly will individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures are involved in numerous and varied legal proceedings  a significant portion of its outstanding litigation arose in three contexts claims for personal injury or death allegedly arising out of exposure to the products produced by the respective entities  claims for personal injury or death  and or property damage allegedly arising out of the generation and disposal of chemical wastes at superfund and other waste disposal sites  and claims for personal injury and or property damage and air  noise and water pollution allegedly arising out of operations 
environmental matters from time to time the company receives notices from federal  state or local governmental entities of alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to  among other things  the disposal  emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances  including hazardous wastes 
although the company has not been the subject of significant penalties to date  such alleged violations may become the subject of enforcement actions or other legal proceedings and may individually or in the aggregate involve monetary sanctions of  or more exclusive of interest and costs 
in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities from arco to the company in  the company agreed to assume certain liabilities arising out of the operation of the company s integrated petrochemicals and refining business prior to july  in connection with the transfer of such liabilities  the company and arco entered into an agreement  updated in the revised cross indemnity agreement  whereby the company agreed to defend and indemnify arco against certain uninsured claims and liabilities which arco may incur relating to the operation of the business of the company prior to july   including certain liabilities that may arise out of pending and future lawsuits 
for current and future cases related to company products and company operations  arco and the company bear a proportionate share of judgment and settlement costs according to a formula that allocates responsibility based on years of ownership during the relevant time period 
the party with the most significant potential liability exposure is responsible for case management and associated costs while allowing the non case managing party to protect its interests 
under the revised cross indemnity agreement  the company will assume responsibility for its proportionate share of future costs for waste site matters not covered by arco insurance 
subject to the uncertainty inherent in all litigation  management believes the resolution of the matters pursuant to the revised cross indemnity agreement will not have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial statements of the company 
pursuant to the terms of the revised cross indemnity agreement  the company is currently contributing funds to the cleanup of one waste site brio  located near houston  texas under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla as amended and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of as of december   the company has accrued million related to future cercla  rcra and tnrcc assessment and remediation costs associated with the above mentioned sites 
the costs are expected to be incurred over the next two to seven years 
in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded for these sites 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the reserve has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in other cercla  rcra  tnrcc or other comparable state law investigations  could require the company to reassess its potential exposure to environmental matters 
in connection with its acquisition of arco chemical  the company is successor to a cross indemnity agreement with arco whereby arco chemical indemnified arco against certain claims or liabilities that arco may incur relating to arco s former ownership and operation of the oxygenates and polystyrenics businesses of arco chemical the former arco businesses  including liabilities under laws relating to the protection of the environment and the workplace and liabilities arising out of certain litigation 
as part of the agreement  arco indemnified arco chemical with respect to claims or liabilities and other matters of litigation not related to the former arco businesses 
arco also indemnified arco chemical for certain federal  foreign  state and local taxes that might be assessed upon audit of the operations of the former arco businesses for periods prior to july  the acquired business environmental liability totaled million at december  based on the company s latest assessment of potential future remediation costs 
a portion of the liability is related to the beaver valley plant site  located in monaca  pennsylvania 
arco chemical sold the beaver valley plant assets to nova chemicals inc nova on september   but retained responsibility for remediation of the land 
final approval of the remediation methods has been granted by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep based upon risk assessment studies submitted by the company 
the company succeeded to an agreement with beazer east  inc beazer whereby beazer has agreed to pay for approximately percent of the beaver valley plant site remediation costs 
the company has also succeeded to an agreement with beazer and the us government whereby the government will pay percent of the costs incurred by the company and beazer for remediation of substantial portions of the beaver valley site 
the remainder of the liability is related to four other plant facilities  including the channelview facility  and one federal superfund site for amounts ranging from million to million per site 
arco chemical was involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to a minimal number of other superfund sites 
however  the company estimates  based on currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with these sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid out over the next five to ten years 
the company has relied upon remedial investigation feasibility studies ri fs at each site of the acquired business as a basis for estimating remediation costs at the site 
ri fs or preliminary assessments have been completed at most of the sites 
however  selection of the remediation method and the cleanup standard to be applied are  in most cases  subject to approval by the appropriate government authority 
accordingly  the company may have possible loss contingencies in excess of the amounts reserved to the extent the scope of remediation required  the final remediation method selected and the cleanup standard applied vary from the assumptions used in estimating the liability 
the company estimates that the upper range of these possible loss contingencies should not exceed the amount accrued by more than million

the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors 
the future declaration and payout of dividends and the amount thereof will be dependent upon the company s results of operations  financial condition  cash position and requirements  investment opportunities  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
subject to these considerations and to the legal considerations discussed in the following paragraph  the company currently intends to distribute to its stockholders cash dividends on its common stock at a quarterly rate of

certain debt instruments which were assumed by equistar  but as to which lyondell remains an obligor provide that the holders of such debt may  under certain limited circumstances  require the obligor to repurchase the debt put rights 
among other things  the put rights may be triggered by the making by either of lyondell or equistar of certain unearned distributions to stockholders or partners  respectively  other than regular dividends  which are followed by a specified decline in public ratings on such debt 
regular dividends are those quarterly cash dividends determined in good faith by the board of directors whose determination is conclusive to be appropriate in light of the company s results of operations and capable of being sustained

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general lyondell took major strategic actions during and to strengthen the company s position in the chemicals industry 
in december  equistar was formed by combining the olefins and polymers businesses of lyondell and millennium 
in may  equistar was expanded with the addition of the olefins and oxygenated chemicals businesses of occidental chemical 
during the third quarter  lyondell acquired arco chemical  the world s largest producer of po and a leading worldwide producer and marketer of polyether polyols  pg  pge  tdi  sm and mtbe 
the operations of the acquired business form the company s intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment 
lyondell s petrochemicals  polymers and refining segments are conducted through its interests in equistar and lcr 
the methanol business conducted through lyondell methanol is not a reportable segment for financial disclosure purposes 
lyondell accounts for its investments in equistar  lcr and lyondell methanol using the equity method of accounting 
in addition to the discussion of lyondell s actual results  a discussion of the unaudited pro forma combined historical results of lyondell and arco chemical see note of notes to consolidated financial statements is presented in order to facilitate the understanding of operating results 
also  actual equistar operating results are compared to the combined operating results of the businesses contributed to equistar by lyondell and millennium for the first eleven months of  together with equistar s december operating results 
results of operations lyondell chemical company overview net income for was million compared with million in and million in earnings for included unusual charges of million after tax  related to the acquisition of arco chemical  the renegotiated labor agreement at lcr and the formation of equistar  compared to unusual charges of approximately million after tax in related to the formation of equistar 
excluding the unusual charges  the decline in net income of million for versus was primarily due to lower prices and margins in the petrochemicals and polymers segments of equistar 
increases in operating income from the acquired business and the refining segment of lcr were more than offset by higher interest expense as a result of entering into the credit facility 
the earnings increase in versus was primarily due to higher sales margins and volumes for petrochemicals and methanol and a higher lcr profit contribution as increased volumes of higher margin heavy crude oil were processed as a result of the completion of the upgrade project 
earnings for also included an approximate million after tax gain from the sale of an undivided interest in the methanol facility 
for the fourth quarter  lyondell reported a loss of million compared to a third quarter loss of million 
the fourth quarter loss included unusual after tax charges of million primarily related to a new agreement with the labor union at lcr and formation costs at equistar 
the new labor agreement at lcr is expected to result in future cost savings 
the third quarter loss included unusual after tax charges of million related to the acquisition and the formation of equistar 
the fourth quarter loss of million  before unusual charges  compared to third quarter income of million before unusual charges  primarily reflected lower operating income and higher interest expense versus the third quarter 
before unusual charges  operating income was million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment showed improvement due to inclusion of a full three months of operations in the fourth quarter versus only two months in the third quarter 
on a comparable three month basis  the intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment showed a decline as lower mtbe margins and seasonally lower mtbe volumes more than offset the benefits from higher sales volumes of core products  defined as po and derivatives and tdi 
results for the petrochemicals and polymers businesses of equistar reflected lower prices and margins as well as the effects of the acceleration of a scheduled plant turnaround 
the timing of this turnaround was accelerated in light of the current down cycle in those segments 
lcr operating results were negatively affected by a fire at a unit and a full quarter of cutbacks of venezuelan crude oil supplies 
higher interest expense reflects a full three months of charges in the fourth quarter under the credit facility 
revenues  operating costs and expenses the operating results for include the company s income from equity investments in equistar  lcr and lyondell methanol and five months of operating results of the acquired business 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the operating results reflect the depreciation and amortization of the estimated fair value of the assets  including the amortization of billion of goodwill over its estimated forty year life 
the company s operating results for include eleven months of operating results of the company s petrochemicals and polymers segments  which were contributed to equistar on december   one month of income from its equity investment in equistar  the company s income from its equity investment in lcr  and the operating results of lyondell methanol 
for  each of the segments was fully consolidated as part of lyondell 
unusual charges unusual charges of million in increased versus million in primarily due to the write off of million of costs assigned to in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of arco chemical 
the company s pro rata share of costs of a new labor agreement at lcr was more than offset by a decrease in the company s pro rata share of equistar formation costs 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense in increased versus primarily due to interest on the billion of debt drawn under the credit facility on july  the decrease in versus is primarily due to the assumption by equistar of lyondell indebtedness as of december  income tax the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in and percent in the effective tax rate increased in versus due to the company s current inability to claim foreign tax credits and limitations on the use of net operating losses for state tax purposes 
the effective income tax rate increased in versus due to the non deductibility of certain executive compensation 
pro forma results of the company and arco chemical the following is a discussion of the operating results for and included in the unaudited pro forma combined historical results of the company and arco chemical see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited pro forma combined historical results give effect to the acquisition  the credit facility drawdown in connection with the acquisition  the formation of equistar and the deconsolidation of lyondell methanol as of the beginning of and  respectively 
the following table sets forth sales volumes for this segment on a pro forma basis for the year ended fourth third december quarter quarter in millions volumes a core products pounds    co products sm pounds   tba and derivatives gallons  a volumes are actual for the fourth quarter and pro forma for the third quarter and for the years ended december  and core products include po  po derivatives and tdi 
revenues pro forma revenues of billion for decreased percent compared to pro forma revenues of billion for the decrease was primarily due to lower average sales prices in  reflecting a combination of downward pressure from lower feedstock costs  ongoing competition in po derivatives and tdi markets  the negative effects of a stronger us dollar on foreign sales  and the effects of weaker asian markets 
core product volumes were essentially flat versus as stronger demand for certain po derivatives in the u 
s 
and europe was offset by lower volumes in asian markets 
increased sm volumes in primarily reflect higher contractual offtake under long term sm processing arrangements 
tba and derivatives volumes decreased in by six percent  mainly due to lower mtbe demand 
income from equity investments pro forma income for was million compared to pro forma income of million for the decrease of million was primarily due to lower margins for petrochemicals and polymers as a result of declining prices  partially offset by higher earnings from lcr as greater volumes of extra heavy crude oil were processed in operating income pro forma operating income of million in decreased million compared to million in the period included unusual charges of million  primarily related to the write off of in process research and development projects of the acquired business and equistar formation costs 
the period included unusual charges of million  primarily related to restructuring and other costs of arco chemical and equistar formation costs 
excluding these items  operating income decreased million 
the lower income from equity investments was only partly offset by higher operating income of arco chemical 
the improved income of arco chemical and the acquired business in was primarily due to higher core product margins and lower fixed costs 
core product margins improved as feedstock costs decreased more than sales prices 
the fixed cost decrease reflected the benefits of the cost reduction program and lower maintenance expense due to fewer scheduled plant turnarounds 
net income pro forma net income for was million compared with million for excluding the effects of the unusual charges  pro forma net income decreased by million in as lower equity income more than offset improved operating results and lower foreign exchange losses of the acquired business 
intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment comparing the fourth quarter to the full pro forma third quarter of the acquired business  the benefit from an increase in sales volumes for core products was more than offset by lower mtbe margins and volumes 
core product volumes were percent higher due to increased demand for urethane products  including polyols and tdi  in the automotive and housing markets 
all three regions  the us  europe and asia  showed volume improvement  particularly the asia region  which showed nearly a percent increase 
mtbe margins declined cents per gallon for the fourth quarter versus the third quarter primarily due to lower worldwide gasoline prices  which pushed down mtbe prices  as well as higher raw material costs in europe

actual versus combined results  actual versus actual results due to the formation of equistar  lyondell s change to the equity method of accounting for its investment in equistar in december  and the resulting difficulty in comparing historically reported financial data  the following review of the petrochemicals and polymers segments is provided on a dual basis 
the actual twelve months operating results reported by equistar  including the occidental contributed business from may   are compared to the combined historical results of the businesses contributed to equistar by lyondell and millennium for the eleven months ended november  and for the one month ended december  of equistar 
the actual operating results reported by the petrochemicals and polymers segments of lyondell for eleven months and by equistar for one month are then compared to the actual operating results of the petrochemicals and polymers segments of lyondell 
the combined results for are not intended to and do not represent pro forma results of equistar 
in addition  they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in the future 
the following tables for the petrochemicals and polymers segments set forth sales volumes for major products  revenues  including intersegment sales  and operating income of these segments as reported by equistar for and  previously  by lyondell for and  as well as lyondell s income from its equity investment in equistar  before unusual charges  for the twelve months ended december   and the one month ended december  petrochemicals segment for the year ended december for the year ended december combined in millions volumes selected petrochemicals products olefins pounds equistar   lyondell   aromatics gallons equistar lyondell revenues equistar   lyondell   operating income equistar operating income lyondell equity income a lyondell operating income segment total a lyondell contributed its petrochemicals business to equistar and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting on december  revenues revenues for declined versus combined revenues  primarily due to lower industry sales prices for ethylene  propylene and co products  partially offset by increased sales volumes as a result of the addition of the occidental contributed business in may the decrease in sales prices is primarily attributable to increased industry capacity and downward pressure on sales prices as a result of lower feedstock costs 
the sales price decreases began in the fourth quarter of and continued their downward trend through most of revenues  as reported by lyondell  increased in versus due primarily to increases in industry sales prices for ethylene and co products 
sales prices in showed significant increases over as strong demand from the polyolefins markets resulted in a tighter balance of supply and demand for olefins 
the increase in sales prices also reflected cost increases for olefins feedstocks over the course of in addition  olefins sales volumes increased due to strong demand in the downstream markets as well as from planned and unscheduled industry turnarounds 
operating income operating income decreased in versus combined primarily due to lower product margins as sales prices declined more than feedstock costs and  to a lesser extent  slightly higher fixed costs 
the lower margins were partially offset by the addition of the occidental contributed business in may operating income  as reported by lyondell  increased significantly in versus due to higher sales margins and volumes 
sales margins improved due to higher sales prices  resulting from stronger demand in the downstream polyolefins markets  and lower petrochemical feedstock costs 
stronger demand also resulted in increased sales volumes 
polymers segment for the year ended december for the year ended december combined in millions volumes polymers products pounds equistar   lyondell   revenues equistar   lyondell operating income equistar operating income lyondell equity income a lyondell operating income segment total a lyondell contributed its polymers business to equistar and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting on december  revenues revenues decreased in versus combined as a result of decreases in industry sales prices 
these sales price decreases were a result of excess industry supply and lower feedstock costs 
the excess industry supply started during the fourth quarter of and continued in a downward trend through revenues  as reported by lyondell  increased in versus as higher industry sales prices for polyethylene were only partially offset by lower industry sales prices for polypropylene 
operating income operating income for decreased versus combined primarily due to decreases in polymers sales prices  which more than offset decreases in polymers feedstock costs 
operating income  as reported by lyondell  in was comparable to unallocated items equistar s unusual charges  which are not allocated to either the petrochemicals or polymers segments  were million and million in and  respectively 
both years included costs associated with the formation of equistar and the consolidation of certain operations 
these costs were paid by equistar and allocated to the partners in accordance with their ownership percentages 
fourth quarter versus third quarter equistar reported a pretax loss of million for the fourth quarter compared to pretax income of million in the third quarter the decrease was attributable to earnings declines in both the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
in petrochemicals  decreased ethylene and co product sales prices were only partially offset by lower feedstock prices 
also contributing to the petrochemicals earnings decrease in the fourth quarter was the turnaround of the laporte facility 
due to current market conditions  equistar elected to both accelerate the timing and extend the length of the turnaround 
the turnaround started in mid november and continued through mid february  rather than as previously scheduled for the third quarter in polymers  earnings also decreased primarily as a result of sales price declines  which exceeded the price decrease of the ethylene feedstock 
in addition  the scheduled turnaround and expansion of the victoria facility had a negative impact on fourth quarter polymers earnings 
this project was completed during the fourth quarter and increased the plant s annual hdpe capacity by approximately million pounds 
earnings were also negatively impacted by the reduction of inventories 
as a result of these actions  earnings were unfavorably affected by over million 
however equistar reduced total working capital during the fourth quarter by approximately million 
in addition  equistar realized a reduction of working capital of approximately million from the sale of receivables in december under a three year revolving securitization agreement 
lyondell citgo refining lp refining segment lyondell s refining segment consists of the results of operations of lcr 
effective january   lyondell began to account for its investment in lcr using the equity method of accounting 
lyondell s share of lcr s earnings before unusual charges for was million compared to million for lcr s results of operations were consolidated in the company would have recorded million in equity income had the company followed the equity method of accounting for its investment in lcr during the narrative discussion that follows compares lcr s operating results to the information for and the following table sets forth sales volumes for lcr s refined products for the year ended december thousand barrels per day refined products gasoline diesel and heating oil jet fuel aromatics other refined products total refined products volumes the following table sets forth processing rates at the refinery for the periods indicated 
refinery runs for are primarily heavy crude oil  whereas the and refinery runs reflect higher volumes of extra heavy crude oil processed 
for the year ended december thousand barrels per day crude processing rates crude supply agreement coked other heavy crude oil coked other crude oil total crude oil revenues revenues for lcr  including intersegment sales  were billion in  billion in and billion in the decrease in versus primarily resulted from lower refined products prices  which declined as a result of lower industry crude prices 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes as production levels increased  reflecting a full year s benefit from the upgrade project 
the slight decrease in compared to primarily resulted from lower crude oil resales  lower refined products prices  and lower aromatics prices  particularly paraxylene 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes as production levels increased after completion of the upgrade project in the first quarter operating income lcr s operating income was million in  million in and million in the increase in versus reflected the benefits of the upgrade project  which resulted in higher average margins as higher volumes of extra heavy crude oil were processed in the coking mode 
the upgrade project was completed in the first quarter and  initially  higher costs were incurred due to normal operational start up activities  during which the refinery did not operate at peak rates 
cost savings resulting from improved operational efficiency in were partly offset by higher depreciation expense attributable to the upgrade project 
lcr s operating income improved in compared to due to improved margins caused primarily by higher volumes of extra heavy crude oil processed in the coking mode under the crude supply agreement 
these improved margins were offset partially by higher production costs  primarily depreciation expense  and lower paraxylene margins 
interest expense lcr s net interest expense was million in  million in and none in interest expense on debt related to construction of the upgrade project was capitalized through its completion  including the first quarter of and the full year fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr had pretax income of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the decline in earnings was due to an unusual charge related to a new agreement with the labor union  a fire in a hydrotreater unit  and the full quarter impact of lower venezuelan crude oil allocations 
beginning in august  lcr began receiving reduced allocations of crude oil from pdvsa due to announced cutbacks in crude oil production in venezuela 
while lcr was able to obtain alternate supplies of crude oil  the margin for these crude oils was lower than for the extra heavy venezuelan crude oil purchased under the crude supply agreement 
total crude oil processing rates averaged  barrels per day in the fourth quarter compared to  barrels per day in the third quarter the new labor agreement is expected to result in efficiency gains and cost savings over the next few years 
lyondell methanol company  lp lyondell s share of lyondell methanol s earnings for was million 
the company would have recorded approximately million in income from its equity investment in lyondell methanol had the company followed the equity method of accounting for its investment in lyondell methanol during the decrease in equity income in versus was due to significant declines in the sales prices of methanol beginning in the first quarter increased supply due to new capacity  as well as weaker demand from the far east  caused worldwide methanol price declines 
financial condition operating activities lyondell s cash provided by operating activities totaled million in compared to million in cash provided by operating activities in included million of proceeds from the sale of domestic receivables in december under a three year revolving securitization agreement 
cash provided by operations in was negatively affected by the payment of liabilities associated with the acquisition and the payment of accounts payable retained by lyondell in the formation of equistar in december investing activities as of july   lyondell completed the acquisition for a total cost of approximately billion  excluding assumed debt 
the company made capital expenditures of million in  primarily related to the acquired business 
during august  lyondell announced the delay of construction of a propylene oxide plant po previously announced by arco chemical 
the previous plan called for the plant to start up in late the company currently anticipates that the additional capacity will be available in late or early equistar s capital expenditures totaled million  of which million was lyondell s pro rata share 
lcr made capital expenditures of million  of which lyondell funded million through loans to lcr 
the company s capital budget is million  including its million pro rata share of the joint ventures capital budgets 
pursuant to its plans to divest certain assets  lyondell announced  on february   the signing of a letter of intent for the sale of its aliphatic diisocyanates adi business 
on march   equistar announced the signing of a letter of intent to sell its compounds and concentrates business 
neither sale is expected to have a material effect on lyondell s consolidated financial statements 
distributions in excess of earnings for were million by equistar  million by lcr  and million by lyondell methanol 
the million distribution from equistar includes million resulting from the company s repayment of the million note payable to equistar 
financing activities during the third quarter  the company obtained a billion credit facility of which billion was drawn down in connection with the financing of the acquisition 
as part of the acquisition  lyondell assumed approximately million of arco chemical debt 
borrowing under the credit facility of billion was used for the purchase of all outstanding shares of arco chemical stock  repayment of debt  including the million note payable to equistar  short term borrowing of lyondell and arco chemical  and other long term borrowing of arco chemical  and payment of certain debt issuance costs 
cash used in other financing activities in consisted primarily of million used to repurchase common stock 
from time to time the company purchases its shares in the market to issue under the company s employee compensation and benefits plans  including stock option and restricted stock plans 
in addition  the company completed the stock buyback program authorized in september by the board of directors in the second quarter of a total of  shares were purchased under the stock buyback program for million 
the company paid regular quarterly dividends of 
per share of common stock in in february  equistar completed an offering of senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of million 
the proceeds were primarily used to refinance existing indebtedness of equistar 
in late  lcr postponed a planned debt refinancing 
the postponement was due to bond market conditions and political change in venezuela associated with the recent presidential elections 
the proceeds of such refinancing would have been used to repay third party construction loans and subordinated loans made to lcr by lyondell and citgo with any remaining cash distributed to the partners 
lcr intends to pursue the refinancing as soon as practical 
liquidity as of december   the company had outstanding consolidated debt of billion and equity of billion 
substantially all of the debt was incurred in july under the credit facility for the purpose of acquiring arco chemical or was assumed as part of the acquisition 
the credit facility requires the company to retire billion of the debt by june  and to issue billion of equity securities  as defined  by july  at the time the credit facility was arranged in july  the company intended to promptly issue billion or more of equity securities to satisfy both these requirements 
an additional billion of debt under the credit facility matures on june  the company anticipated that a combination of forecasted operating cash flows and proceeds to the company from the then planned lcr refinancing together with a planned offering of debt securities would be used to repay or refinance the debt due in june however  the company postponed its plans for a fall securities offering as a result of adverse changes in capital market conditions that began in august in addition  the cyclical downturn in commodity chemicals adversely affected both the company s operating results and the market valuation of its common stock 
in late  lcr s refinancing plans were postponed for the reasons discussed above 
the postponement of the billion equity offering and related debt paydown  combined with the decline in recent and projected operating results  could make it more difficult for the company to remain in compliance with certain financial ratio requirements contained in the credit facility as those ratios become more restrictive under the existing terms 
as a result of all the foregoing  the company has proposed an amendment to the credit facility that would  among other things  substantially reduce the requirements for sale of equity and ease the financial ratio requirements 
the amendment requires approval by lenders holding a majority of the commitments 
the company intends to complete the amendment of the credit facility and to effect debt and equity offerings in the second quarter of  using the proceeds to meet the june debt maturity 
at the same time  the company is actively exploring other available alternative means of retiring or refinancing debt  including other financing sources  enhancement of operating cash flows through cost reductions  management of working capital levels and sales of assets 
the company continues to believe that repositioning its balance sheet to achieve an investment grade rating over time is an important objective 
the ability of the company to meet its debt obligations  finance its capital expenditure needs  maintain its dividend rate and comply with the covenants and financial requirements in the credit facility will generally depend on the future performance of the company  the outcome of the credit facility amendment process  and the availability and terms of additional financing or alternative means to repay and refinance bank debt 
these factors  in turn  are affected by relevant prevailing economic  competitive and market conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
the breach of any of the covenants or financial requirements in the credit facility could result in a default thereunder  which would permit the lenders to declare the loans immediately payable and to terminate future lending commitments 
based on discussions to date with its agent banks and prospective underwriters and on current market conditions  the company is optimistic that it will be able to amend the terms of the credit facility and to complete debt and equity offerings on satisfactory terms 
accordingly  the company believes conditions will be such that cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  and funds from anticipated financing activities and lines of credit will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements for scheduled debt repayments  necessary capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  as of december   equistar  lcr and lyondell methanol had  in the aggregate  outstanding debt of approximately billion and equity of approximately billion 
the ability of the joint ventures to distribute cash to the company is reduced by their respective debt service obligations 
furthermore  a default under certain joint venture debt agreements would constitute a cross default under the company s credit facility 
the company also remains liable on approximately million of debt for which primary responsibility was assumed by equistar in connection with its formation 
current business outlook beginning august   lyondell s operating results include the acquired business  which is reported as the intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment 
management expects continued stable growth for the core products in this segment in  although prices and margins may be adversely affected in the latter part of the year by the start up of new industry po capacity in europe 
the company has delayed the po project by two years with a view to mitigating potential oversupply of po as well as sm 
however  co products sm and mtbe are expected to continue to be affected by weak market conditions 
furthermore  environmental concerns in california and other states  principally over groundwater contamination due to leaking underground storage tanks  could lead to legislation that might negatively affect the demand for mtbe over the long term 
the petrochemicals and polymers segments continue to be affected by overcapacity  resulting in weak pricing 
however  spot prices for ethylene have improved and industry inventory levels of ethylene have declined well below benchmark levels that usually indicate a balanced market 
demand for polymers continues to grow overall 
however  this growth has been overshadowed by new capacity that has put downward pressure on polymers prices 
polymers prices have approached historical trough levels 
the impact of low prices for petrochemicals and polymers products is mitigated to the extent that the low prices increase demand for these products versus substitute materials 
additionally  the low sales prices are partly offset by lower feedstock costs as a result of low current crude oil and energy costs 
equistar has taken aggressive actions to buffer the cyclical downturn  including accelerations of the laporte plant turnaround from the third quarter to mid november  the announced idling of a substantial portion of hdpe capacity at the port arthur plant scheduled for march   reductions in working capital  and cost reductions through the achievement of synergies 
equistar continues to focus on cost reduction and synergies 
many of the cost reduction programs have required time and capital to achieve with the benefits just now beginning to be realized 
for example  in november  equistar began implementation of the sap information system on a company wide basis 
completion of implementation in will eliminate the extra expense and inefficiency of running and coordinating multiple systems 
additionally  the laporte plant turnaround included changes that enable the plant to run heavier  cheaper feedstocks  thereby reducing ethylene production costs 
lcr s financial results will continue to be impacted by the reduction in pdvsa crude oil allocations which took effect in august in addition  in march opec announced an agreement to further limit opec oil production  which could result in some additional decreases in the allocation of crude oil supplied to lcr by pdvsa 
decreased allocations of pdvsa crude oil tend to reduce lcr s pretax income and accordingly lyondell s pro rata share of lcr s income 
lcr is moving forward with a multi year program to reduce operating costs  the new labor agreement is part of that program 
the methanol market continues to be weak due to considerable excess capacity 
methanol margins are expected to continue at current low levels  as prices remain flat 
improvement is not anticipated in the near term 
lyondell methanol took advantage of the current low margin environment  implementing a turnaround in february that will include process enhancements designed to reduce methanol production costs 
year lyondell  equistar and lcr use many business information information technology or it systems as well as non it systems such as manufacturing support and other systems that could be affected by the year problem 
the year problem arises from computer programs and computer and other equipment with embedded chips or processors that use two digits rather than four to designate the year 
date sensitive computer operations may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  resulting in system failures or miscalculations  which may cause operational disruptions 
lyondell and equistar have replaced many of their business information computer systems including systems operated by equistar for lyondell methanol 
lcr is also in the process of replacing many of its business information systems 
the new systems  based on enterprise software from sap america  inc sap  will replace older business systems and allow employees at different locations to share financial and operating information more effectively 
the first major use of the software commenced in may for the majority of the operations contributed to equistar by lyondell 
equistar s second major sap implementation phase was successfully completed in november  while additional sap work will be completed in the first half of lcr will complete implementation of its sap project at the beginning of the new systems and software are year compliant  thus addressing the majority of the company s year business system requirements 
lyondell has elected to continue with the repair and remediation for the majority of systems of the acquired business 
the company has a year executive sponsor team with representatives of lyondell  equistar and lcr 
the year executive sponsor team is providing oversight to individual year steering committees within each organization 
each steering committee is in the process of completing an assessment of the state of readiness of the it and non it systems of the company and its joint ventures 
these assessments cover manufacturing systems  including laboratory information systems and field instrumentation  and significant third party vendor and supplier systems  including employee compensation and benefit plan maintenance systems 
the steering committees are also in the process of assessing the readiness of significant customers and suppliers 
the year assessment process for each organization consists of an inventory of year sensitive equipment  an assessment of the impact of possible failures  determination of the required remediation actions  and testing and implementation of solutions 
the inventory  assessment and remediation phases should be completed in the first quarter of  with the remainder of the testing and final implementation taking place in the progress of these phases as of december  is summarized as follows lyondell enterprise year readiness as of december  graph showing the percentage of completion of the inventory  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation phases of the year assessment process for each of lyondell  equistar and lcr 
the percentage of completion is indicated in the table below lyondell enterprise year readiness as of december  inventory assessment remediation testing implementation lyondell equistar lcr as of december   year spending by the company  equistar and lcr for the replacement of both it and non it systems is summarized as follows millions of dollars lyondell equistar lcr spending through december  estimated additional spending total estimated spending lyondell share of estimated spending the total estimated spending of million for all three organizations represents a midpoint of an estimated range between million and million  of which the company s share would be million to million 
the estimated amount does not include costs incurred in connection with the implementation of sap related software 
these spending estimates will be refined as phases of the assessment are completed 
spending is funded by cash generated from operations 
preliminary estimates indicate that approximately to percent of the estimated spending could qualify for capitalization 
management believes that all significant systems controlled by the company will be year ready in the last half of the company s operations are dependent on a continuous supply of key services from raw material suppliers and utility and transportation providers 
while the steering committees are assessing the readiness of third party customers and suppliers  there can be no assurance that third parties with a significant business relationship will successfully test  reprogram  and replace all of their it and non it systems on a timely basis 
the company is developing contingency plans with the assistance of an outside consultant 
the final plans  when implemented  are intended to avoid material interruption of core business operations through the year and beyond  while ensuring safe operations and responsible financial performance 
the contingency planning will involve an analysis of critical business processes and an identification of the most likely threats to these processes 
solutions and alternatives will be developed for these internal or external threats 
the enterprise expects to complete its analysis and plan development by mid year with implementation to be completed in the last half of the year 
there is inherent uncertainty in the year problem due to the possibility of unanticipated failures by third party customers and suppliers 
accordingly  the company is unable  at this time  to assess the extent and resulting materiality of the impact of possible year failures on its operations  liquidity or financial position 
in a worst case scenario  controlled plant shutdowns using the company s standard shutdown procedures might be necessitated by failures of utility providers or suppliers or by internal conditions affecting plant operability 
such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  liquidity or financial position 
the year assessment process is expected to provide information that will significantly reduce the level of uncertainty regarding the year impact 
management believes that the completion of the assessment as scheduled will help minimize the possibility of any significant disruptions of company operations 
european monetary union on january   the euro became the official currency for the eleven member countries of the european union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain that are participating in monetary union 
on that date  the national currencies of the participating countries ceased to exist as independent currencies and continued only as denominations of the euro 
the euro conversion rates for each of the former national currencies were irrevocably fixed on january  euro banknotes and coins will be introduced on january  and the former national currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn by july  at the latest 
the company has substantially completed a review of its principal european markets and does not expect european monetary union to have a material effect on the conduct of its business 
specifically  there are no major competitive implications for product pricing  and most significant contracts are expected to remain in force with no renegotiation expected 
similarly  there is no impact on the company s foreign currency swap and forward contracts  which hedge risks between the us dollar and these currencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the european based revenues of the acquired business are approximately billion on an annual basis 
while the company has converted its systems to invoice customers in euros beginning january   the conversion of other business and financial systems is still in the planning and implementation stages 
due to year priorities  it is anticipated that the conversion of most business systems to the euro will not begin until the fourth quarter of with a target completion date of january  the deadline for conversion of systems is january  based upon the assessments completed to date  the company does not expect the onset of european monetary union to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of the company 
the company s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  cercla  as amended  rcra and the clean air act amendments 
in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities from atlantic richfield company arco to the company at the time the company was formed  effective july   the company and arco entered into an agreement the cross indemnity agreement whereby the company agreed to defend and indemnify arco against certain uninsured claims and liabilities that arco might incur relating to the operation of the business of the company prior to july   including certain liabilities that may arise out of pending and future lawsuits 
arco  along with many other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party prp under cercla in connection with the past disposal of waste at third party waste sites 
pursuant to the cross indemnity agreement  the company is currently contributing funds for one site pursuant to its obligation to reimburse arco for a portion of its uninsured remediation costs 
under the revised cross indemnity agreement  both arco and the company waive any claim for reimbursement under the existing cross indemnity agreement for any prior defense and settlement costs associated with waste site matters  and the company will assume responsibility for its proportionate share of future costs for waste site matters not covered by arco insurance 
the obligation described above will continue under the revised cross indemnity agreement 
lyondell  millennium and occidental have similar indemnifications with equistar related to the petrochemicals and polymers businesses contributed by the companies 
equistar has agreed to indemnify and defend lyondell  millennium and occidental  individually  up to million each  against certain uninsured claims and liabilities asserted within the first seven years after the respective asset contributions that equistar may incur relating to the operation of the contributed businesses prior to their contribution to equistar  subject to certain terms of the asset contribution agreements 
the company accrues for contingencies  including those based upon unasserted claims that are probable and reasonably estimable 
in connection with environmental matters  the company establishes accruals based upon known facts and circumstances 
based on current environmental laws and regulations  the company believes it has adequately accrued for the matters described herein 
lyondell s accrued environmental liability at december  was million  including million related to the acquired business environmental liability 
the environmental liability of the acquired business reflected the company s latest assessment of potential future remediation costs associated with currently known sites 
the liability is related to four current plant sites  one former plant site and one federal superfund site for amounts ranging from million to million per site 
the acquired business is involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to a minimal number of other superfund sites 
however  the company estimates  based on currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with these sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid out over the next five to ten years 
the company has relied upon ri fs at each of the acquired business sites as a basis for estimating remediation costs at the site 
ri fs or preliminary assessments have been completed at most of the sites 
however  selection of the remediation method and the cleanup standard to be applied are  in most cases  subject to approval by the appropriate government authority 
accordingly  the company may have possible loss contingencies in excess of the amounts reserved to the extent the scope of remediation required  the final remediation method selected and the cleanup standard applied vary from the assumptions used in estimating the liability 
the company estimates that the upper range of these possible loss contingencies should not exceed the million amount accrued by more than million 
the extent of loss related to environmental matters ultimately depends upon a number of factors  including technological developments  changes in environmental laws  the number and ability to pay of other parties involved at a particular site and the company s potential involvement in additional environmental assessments and cleanups 
based upon currently known facts  management believes that any remediation costs the company may incur in excess of the amounts accrued or disclosed above would not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  the resolution of one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material impact on the company s results of operations for that period 
the company spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  relating to environmental remediation matters 
the company estimates that expenditures will total approximately million in the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures also make capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
such capital expenditures totaled  in the aggregate  approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company estimates that such capital expenditures will total approximately million in and will not be materially different in the amounts reported above include the full twelve months spending of the acquired arco chemical business 
industry cyclicality and overcapacity the company s historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of both the chemical and refining industries 
both industries are mature and capital intensive  and industry margins are sensitive to supply and demand balances  which have historically been cyclical 
the chemical industry historically has experienced alternating periods of tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods of substantial capacity additions  resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins 
due to the commodity nature of most of the company s products  the company is not necessarily able to protect its market position by product differentiation or to pass on cost increases to its customers 
accordingly  increases in raw material and other costs do not necessarily correlate with changes in product prices  either in the direction of the price change or in absolute magnitude 
moreover  a number of participants in various segments of the chemical industry have announced plans for expansion of plant capacity 
there can be no assurance that future growth in product demand will be sufficient to utilize this additional  or even current  capacity 
excess industry capacity  to the extent it occurs  may depress the company s volumes and margins 
as a result  the company s earnings may be subject to significant fluctuations 
external factors beyond the company s control  such as general economic conditions  competitor action  international events and circumstances and governmental regulation in the united states and abroad  can cause volatility in feedstock prices  as well as fluctuations in demand for the company s products  product prices  volumes and margins  and can magnify the impact of economic cycles on the company s business 
a number of the company s products are highly dependent on durable goods markets  such as housing and automotive  that are particularly cyclical 
with respect to the company s refining business  however  management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement tends to stabilize earnings and to substantially reduce the market driven aspects of volatility 
foreign operations and country risks international operations and exports to foreign markets are subject to a number of risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks and risks of increases in duties and taxes  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  earnings of foreign subsidiaries and intercompany payments may be subject to foreign income tax rules that may reduce cash flow available to meet required debt service and other obligations of the company 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement is effective for the company s calendar year  however  early adoption is permitted 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending upon whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
and whether it will adopt this pronouncement prior to the effective date 
forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in this report  including those set forth in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as those set forth in item a disclosure of market risk  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although lyondell believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  they do involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and lyondell can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  uncertainties associated with the united states and worldwide economies  current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and in other countries  substantial chemical and refinery capacity additions resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins  raw material costs or supply arrangements  the company s ability to implement cost reductions  and operating interruptions including leaks  explosions  fires  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  spills and releases and other environmental risks 
many of such factors are beyond lyondell s or its joint ventures ability to control or predict 
management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels 
all forward looking statements in this form k are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report 
item a 
disclosure of market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of the company s products and feedstocks  as well as those of equistar  lcr and lyondell methanol  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of the company s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
the company tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include increasing the olefins plants feedstock flexibility  entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  and the use of the deemed margin contract at lcr 
the company has not used derivative instruments for commodity hedging purposes 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures result from cash flows between us and foreign operations and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a foreign operating entity 
the company uses foreign currency swap and forward contracts to minimize the exposure related to net monetary exposures on the balance sheet and anticipatory cash flows 
although the company uses these types of contracts to reduce foreign exchange exposures with respect to revenues  capital commitments and other expenses denominated in foreign currencies  there can be no assurance that such hedging techniques will protect the company s reported results against exchange rate fluctuations or that the company will not incur material losses on such contracts 
at december   the company had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million  principally swap contracts hedging the dutch guilder 
using sensitivity analysis  the hypothetical increase in foreign exchange loss due to these derivative instruments from an assumed percent unfavorable change in year end exchange rates was not material 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
these include variable rate term loans outstanding of billion and treasury lock transactions in the notional amount of billion at december  the treasury locks are based on us treasury rates and are being used to hedge anticipated company debt offerings 
assuming a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates  the increase in annual interest expense on the variable rate term loans would be million 
the hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a potential change in the fair value of treasury locks from a million obligation at december  to a million obligation  which would be amortized over the term of the anticipated debt offering 
sensitivity analysis was used for the purpose of this analysis
