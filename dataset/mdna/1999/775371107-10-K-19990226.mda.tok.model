item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statements any statements made by the company in its filings with the securities and exchange commission or other communications including press releases and analyst meetings and calls that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements include  without limitation  those relating to anticipated product plans  litigation and environmental matters  currency effects  profitability  and other commitments or goals 
forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following currencies 
approximately half of the company s revenues are from outside the united states  a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies 
also  significant production facilities are located outside the united states 
the company s financial results therefore can be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
though the company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects  it does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
accordingly  reported revenue  net income  cash flows and fair values have been and in the future may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  because of the extensive nature of the company s foreign business activities  financial results could be adversely affected by changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in trade policies or tariffs  changes in interest rates  and political unrest 
competition and demand 
the company s products are sold in a competitive  global economy 
competitors include many large multinational chemical firms based in europe  japan and the united states 
these competitors often have resources that are greater than the company s 
in addition  financial results are subject to fluctuations in demand and the seasonal activity of certain of the company s businesses 
the company also manufactures and sells its products to customers in industries and countries that are experiencing periods of rapid change  most notably countries in the asia pacific region 
also  weather conditions have historically had  and will likely continue to have in the future  a significant impact on revenues and earnings in the company s agricultural chemicals business 
these factors can adversely affect demand for the company s products and therefore may have a significant impact on financial results 
supply and capacity 
from time to time certain raw materials the company requires become limited 
it is likely this will occur again in the future 
should such limitations arise  disruptions of the company s supply chain may lead to higher prices and or shortages 
also  from time to time  the company is subject to increases in raw material prices and  from time to time  experiences significant capacity limitations in its own manufacturing operations 
these limitations  disruptions in supply  price increases and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results 
technology 
the company has invested significant resources in intellectual properties such as patents  trademarks  copyrights  and trade secrets 
the company relies on the protection these intellectual property rights provide since it depends on these intellectual resources for its financial stability and its future growth 
the development and successful implementation of new  competing technologies in the market place could significantly impact future financial results 
joint ventures and acquisitions 
the company has entered  and in the future may enter  into arrangements with other companies to expand product offerings and to enhance its own capabilities 
it will likely also continue to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures 
the success of acquisitions of new technologies  companies and products  or arrangements with third parties  is not predictable and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in realizing its objectives  or that realization may not take longer than anticipated  or that there will not be unintended adverse consequences from these actions

earnings in were million  higher than the million reported in diluted earnings per common share were  up from the previous year 
despite volume growth  sales of  million were essentially unchanged from due to weaker currencies in europe and asia pacific and the absence of petroleum chemicals sales which were part of the unconsolidated rohmax joint venture during all business segments helped the volume increase  except chemical specialties  in part due to lower volume in agricultural chemicals 
all regions also contributed  with the european and latin american regions maintaining strong volume momentum throughout the year 
in addition to volume growth within consolidated operations  earnings in affiliates benefited from strong volume in rohmax and rodel  as well as reduced losses in atohaas europe

recent developments on january   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of learonal  inc learonal  a maker of specialty chemicals for the electronics industry 
the company added this business to its electronic materials segment in on january   the company and morton international  inc morton approved a merger agreement under which the company will acquire morton in a cash and stock transaction valued at billion  including the assumption of million of debt 
the transaction adds international leadership positions in adhesives  specialty coatings  electronic materials and salt 
learonal and morton are not included in the company s results 

see below discussion of acquisitions and divestitures for more information on these transactions 
performance polymers earnings  excluding non recurring items  were million  up from sales were down to  million from  million in  largely as a result of the absence of atohaas sales of million 
volume was flat and sales decreased on a comparable business basis 
the decrease in sales on flat volume was primarily a result of unfavorable currencies in europe and asia pacific and lower selling prices 
performance polymers sales in the asia pacific region were down more than from the prior year while volume decreased 
earnings increased slightly  excluding non recurring items  largely as a result of lower raw material prices and higher volume in north america and europe 
performance polymers reported earnings of million  up from excluding the effect of the former petroleum chemicals business  which was part of the unconsolidated rohmax joint venture in  sales were up on an volume increase 
volume growth was evident in all regions and reflected strong performances in the paper  adhesives and coatings markets 
monomers and formulation chemicals also showed volume increases 
volume largely drove the segment s earnings increase 
the positive effects  however  were held back by lower selling prices and weaker currencies  the dollar value of which declined an average of in europe and in japan during the year 
earnings in the plastics business also contributed as a result of improvement in atohaas europe  where modest earnings were reported compared with significant losses in though plastics volume increased  sales decreased  reflecting decreased selling prices and weaker currencies in europe 
continuing pricing pressure in most plastics sectors also dampened plastics earnings recovery 
in atohaas europe was hurt by a million after tax write off of start up expenses for a plant in italy 
chemical specialties earnings in were million  excluding non recurring items  up from million in sales of million decreased from sales of million  in part due to weaker currencies in europe and asia pacific and to lower selling prices 
volume was flat for the segment despite strong mid year demand in the agricultural chemicals business  which was partially offset by decreased comparative results for the ion exchange resins business  particularly in asia and eastern europe 
the earnings increase was driven by strength in the agricultural chemicals and biocides businesses particularly in north america 
asia volume driven earnings decreases in the ion exchange resins business offset most of these increases 
chemical specialties reported earnings of million  down from earnings of million 
sales decreased on a volume decrease 
the earnings decrease was primarily due to results in the agricultural chemicals business  where earnings were lower than in sales and volume in this business decreased from  primarily because of weather related lower dithane fungicide shipments in all regions except latin america 
sales of other agricultural chemical product lines showed growth 
it was this lower sales and volume and weaker currencies in europe and japan that largely drove the earnings decrease for the chemical specialties segment 
volume growth and operating improvements in the ion exchange resins business helped improve earnings but the comparison to was hurt by the absence of a million after tax gain from the sale of land in japan in that year 
another factor affecting the comparison to the prior year was the discontinuation of the biocides joint venture with dead sea bromine in  which decreased both net sales and earnings 
electronic materials earnings of million in  excluding non recurring items  decreased million  or  from the period 
sales and volume were essentially flat 
shipley company volume increased in all regions  except asia pacific  which offset the other regions 
the effects of solid growth in north america and the contribution of rodel  a owned affiliate acquired in  were mitigated by lower sales and earnings in asia pacific 
nineteen ninety seven earnings of million in electronic materials increased compared with million in this earnings increase largely was a result of volume in shipley company 
the company s share of earnings from rodel  inc  a investment  also contributed 
sales increased to million from million reported in the period 
volume growth and earnings were strong in asia pacific and north america  driven largely by positive results in the microelectronics and printed wiring board businesses 
demand was strong for both shipley and rodel products throughout corporate expenses totaled million in  compared with million in and million in after tax charges of million related to extraordinary losses on the early extinguishment of debt were included in results while reflects an after tax gain of million  the result of remediation settlements with insurance carriers during the fourth quarter

on a comparable business basis  sales decreased while volume was flat 
in addition to the divestiture of two businesses  resulting in the exclusion of atohaas sales from  the remaining of norsohaas was acquired and operations in china were consolidated during the year 
the sales decrease on higher volume is largely a result of weaker currencies  primarily in asia pacific  and lower selling prices

raw material prices declined throughout largely as a result of lower prices in north america for acetone  methanol  propylene and other monomer related raw materials  primarily benefiting the performance polymers segment 
raw material prices were stable in they declined throughout the first three quarters of  until natural gas and oil prices increased in the fourth quarter of that year 
prices for raw materials  including methanol  propylene  acetone and butanol  were down  net  in compared to decreases of and in and  respectively  excluding currency impacts

environmental there is a risk of environmental damage in chemical manufacturing operations 
the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the possibility of significant environmental damage 
these laws and regulations require the company to make significant expenditures for remediation  capital improvements and the operation of environmental protection equipment 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company s major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
the company is a party in various government enforcement and private actions associated with former waste disposal sites  many of which are on the us environmental protection agency s epa superfund priority list 
the company is also involved in corrective actions at some of its manufacturing facilities 
the company considers a broad range of information when determining the amount of its remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for this or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other principally responsible parties to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
these accruals are updated quarterly as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
major sites for which reserves have been provided are the non company owned lipari  woodland and kramer sites in new jersey  and whitmoyer in pennsylvania and company owned sites in bristol and philadelphia  pennsylvania  and in houston  texas 
in addition  the company has provided for future costs at approximately other sites where it has been identified as potentially responsible for cleanup costs and  in some cases  damages for alleged personal injury or property damage 
the amount charged to earnings before tax for environmental remediation  net of insurance recoveries  was million in in  remediation related settlements with insurance carriers  a million charge resulting from an unfavorable arbitration decision relating to the woodlands sites  and other waste remediation expenses resulted in a net gain of million 
the charge  net of insurance recoveries  was million 
the reserves for remediation were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are recorded as other liabilities current and long term 
the company is in the midst of lawsuits over insurance coverage for environmental liabilities 
it is the company s practice to reflect environmental insurance recoveries in results of operations for the quarter in which the litigation is resolved through settlement or other appropriate legal process 
resolutions typically resolve coverage for both past and future environmental spending 
insurance recoveries receivable  included in accounts receivable  net  were million at december  and million at december  the company settled with several of its insurance carriers in january for approximately million 
these settlements will be recognized in income in in addition to accrued environmental liabilities  the company has reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million at december  and further  the company has identified other sites  including its larger manufacturing facilities in the united states  where additional future environmental remediation may be required  but these loss contingencies are not reasonably estimable at this time 
these matters involve significant unresolved issues  including the number of parties found liable at each site and their ability to pay  the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  the alternative methods of remediation and the range of costs associated with those alternatives 
the company believes that these matters  when ultimately resolved  which may be over an extended period of time  will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows of the company  but could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations in any given year because of the company s obligation to record the full projected cost of a project when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million in spending for and is expected to be approximately million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental aspects of projects in other categories below which are intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
the company expects future capital spending for environmental protection equipment to be consistent with prior year spending patterns 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
cash expenditures for waste disposal site remediation were million in  million in and million in the expenditures for remediation are charged against accrued remediation reserves 
the cost of operating and maintaining environmental facilities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was charged against current year earnings 
dividends total common stock dividends paid in were 
per share  compared to 
per share in and 
per share in the company s common stock dividend payout is targeted at approximately of trend line earnings 
common stock dividends have been paid each year since the common stock dividend payout has increased annually every year since total preferred dividends paid were per share in  and additions to land  buildings and equipment fixed asset additions in were million  down million from the prior year s spending of million 
the decrease reflects the absence of significant projects in process during  such as the completion of capacity expansion in texas 
improved asset utilization also contributed to the lower spending 
nineteen ninety eight spending focused on emulsions capacity in europe  ion exchange resin and emulsions capacity in asia pacific and further investment in the electronic materials businesses 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures in of approximately million 
spending for environmental protection equipment  which is included in several of the categories in the table shown below  was million in  million in and million in expenditures for the past three years  categorized by primary purpose of project  were millions of dollars environmental  cost savings and infrastructure capacity additions and new products research facilities and equipment capitalized interest cost total acquisitions and divestitures on january   the company and morton approved a merger agreement under which the company will acquire morton in a cash and stock transaction valued at billion  including the assumption of million of debt 
the transaction creates a global specialty chemical company with combined annual revenues of billion and will provide the company with international leadership positions in adhesives  specialty coatings  electronic materials and salt 
on february  the company commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to  shares of morton common stock for per share  representing of the outstanding morton shares on january  the tender offer is subject to certain conditions including  among other things  the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of morton on a fully diluted basis  the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino act  and the receipt of european union approval 
the offer is scheduled to expire on friday  march   unless extended 
the tender offer is not conditioned upon obtaining financing 
following the successful completion of the tender offer  the company intends to acquire the remaining morton shares in a second step merger 
in this step  subject to shareholder approval  each share of morton will be exchanged for between and of company shares based on the company s stock price for a period of twenty days prior to closing  or  if fewer than  shares are purchased in the tender  for a combination of cash and company stock 
on january  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of learonal for approximately million 
learonal develops and manufactures specialty chemical processes used in the manufacture of printed circuit boards  semiconductor packaging and electronic connector plating  and also provides processes for metal finishing applications 
learonal reported million in sales and million in net income for its fiscal year ended february  the learonal and morton acquisitions will be financed through a combination of commercial paper  bank loans and long term debt and will be accounted for using the purchase method 
their results are not included in the company s results 
the company sold its interest in the atohaas and rohmax businesses in june for cash proceeds of million  resulting in a net after tax gain of million  or 
per share 
subsequent to the sale of the atohaas joint venture  the buyer asserted a claim against the company in late related to the value of certain joint venture assets 
because the investigation and assessment of this claim is not expected to be completed until the latter part of the first quarter of  the potential amount of the claim and its impact on results of operations and financial position  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
during and  the company purchased a interest in rodel and in early purchased an additional interest 
the total cost for these investments was approximately million 
rodel is a privately held  delaware based leader in precision polishing technology serving the semiconductor  memory disk and glass polishing industries 
the investment is accounted for on the equity method with the company s share of earnings reported as equity in affiliates 
also in  the company acquired the remaining interest in norsohaas  which was an affiliate in stock repurchases for the three years ended december   the company repurchased more than million shares  or approximately of common shares outstanding  at a cost of approximately billion 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at a total cost of million 
most of the shares were obtained in august through an accelerated stock repurchase program with a third party 
under the terms of this purchase  the final cost to the company will reflect the average share price paid by the third party in the market over an extended trading period 
through december   the company had repurchased two thirds of the million shares of common stock authorized under the current buyback program and received board approval in october for another buyback program of an additional million shares 
the company does not intend to buy back a significant number of shares in the near future 
the company purchased  shares in at a cost of million 
there were  and  common shares outstanding at december  and  respectively 
stock split and retirements in  the board of directors declared a three for one split of the company s common stock 
the stock split was effected in the form of a common stock dividend 
the par value of the common stock remained unchanged at per share 
also in  the company retired million treasury shares 
as a result of these transactions  the company reclassified million from retained earnings to common stock 
this amount represents the total par value of new shares issued  net of retirements of treasury shares 
amounts per share  numbers of common shares and capital accounts have been restated to give retroactive effect to the stock split 
working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities was million at year end  down from million in accounts receivable from customers decreased million  while inventory decreased million and notes payable increased million

return on common stockholders equity roe is obtained by dividing net earnings less preferred stock dividends by average year end common stockholders equity 
average year end common stockholders equity is calculated without the reduction for the esop transaction 
roe was in  in and in euro beginning in eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common currency after establishing fixed conversion rates from their existing currencies 
the company formed a multifunctional steering team to evaluate the potential effect of the euro in key impact areas such as information technology  treasury  supply chain and accounting 
the company s view is that the relevant systems and processes related to these functions are generally capable of accommodating a conversion to the euro  therefore  the company does not expect that the conversion will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
year during management initiated an enterprise wide program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for the year  and  in  began assessing supply chain and customer implications 
all of the company s centralized computer systems have been inventoried and assessed to determine their year readiness 
remediation of all systems was originally scheduled for completion by year end remediation of most computer applications supporting manufacturing is complete while remediation of sales and marketing  order processing and financial systems is expected to be completed by the end of april the company is closely tracking the remediation of systems that are not yet complete and will devote resources  as necessary  to bring them back on schedule 
testing of all remediated systems is expected to be completed by june as originally planned 
assessment and most remediation of key process control and other plant floor systems at each facility is complete 
some remaining remediation is scheduled for early in addition to these internal systems and processes  the company has placed a high priority on assessing the status of its critical suppliers and business partners  such as warehouses  toll manufacturers  distributors and transportation services 
the company expects all of its internal remediation and testing to be completed by june  however  despite its best efforts  business may be interrupted with potentially material impact on its financial position or results of operations if any of the following occur external supply of raw materials or utilities is delayed or unavailable for an extended period  manufacturing systems fail  or  central corporate computer systems fail 
to limit the effects of these potential failures  the company has completed corporate contingency planning guidelines and will prepare contingency plans for potential disruptions of critical systems or processes 
examples of contingency plans include a freezing of modifications to computer systems  ensuring availability of additional information technology personnel during the critical time period  backing up systems at off site facilities  making alternate raw material supply arrangements  and preparing for temporary shut downs of certain plants and facilities 
in addition  the company has standard operating procedures in place for a safe and orderly shut down of systems and facilities should this be necessary 
a significant proportion of the costs associated with the year effort represent the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
in addition  consulting and other expenses related to software application and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare the systems for the year will be incurred 
approximately half of these costs  which are expected to total million  have been incurred and charged to expense through december  this discussion contains forward looking statements based  in part  on assumptions such as the following that the manufacturers of the company s computer systems and software have correctly represented the year status of their products  that the company s suppliers and customers will meet their stated year and euro compliance obligations  and that the company s own investigation  remediation  testing and systems implementations are successful 
the year and euro discussions and other forward looking statements made in this report are based on current expectations and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed here as well as those detailed in the cautionary statements section of the form k  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
actual results in the future may differ from those projected 
recent accounting standards in  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities  which became effective in the statement provides authoritative guidance regarding the recognition  measurement  display and disclosure of environmental remediation liabilities 
the company s adoption of this accounting guidance in did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires computation and presentation of basic and dilutive earnings per share 
basic earnings per share eps is computed by dividing net income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted 
for the years presented  the company s basic earnings per share are equal to earnings per share reported under the previous accounting standards 
dilutive earnings per share is slightly lower than basic earnings per share  primarily due to the impact of convertible preferred stock 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period from all transactions other than those with shareholders  including net income  foreign currency related items and unrealized gain loss on certain securities 
the disclosures prescribed by this standard were adopted in and are presented in the statement of consolidated stockholders equity 
also in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information and  in  sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
both standards establish guidance for disclosure in annual financial statements 
the company s business segment reporting under sfas no 
are consistent with the changes in its financial reporting structure incorporated in the company s reporting since the first quarter of as required  the company adopted the disclosures prescribed by both statements in its year end reporting 
in  the fasb issued sfas no

the sale of the interest in atohaas  the purchase of the remaining of norsohaas  already owned  and the consolidation of china were effective january  on a comparable basis  volume increased  sales decreased and earnings increased 
the sales decrease on higher volume is primarily a result of weaker european and asia pacific currencies 
strong european volume and a good performance in north america helped the company overcome poor business conditions in the asia pacific region  where volume and sales decreased and  respectively 
earnings increased as a result of higher overall volume  lower raw material costs and smooth plant operations 
in addition to higher earnings  the per share increase in the first  and all subsequent quarters in  reflects the impact of the company s common share repurchase program

on a comparable business basis  volume was flat and sales decreased 
in addition to the divestiture of two businesses  resulting in the exclusion of atohaas sales from results  the remaining of norsohaas was acquired and operations in china were consolidated in the sales decrease on flat volume was primarily a result of weaker european and asia pacific currencies and slightly lower selling prices

in the asia pacific region sales declined on a volume decrease 
the company s earnings increased  excluding non recurring items  primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and efficient plant operations

asia pacific region sales declined on a volume decrease 
the company s earnings decreased  excluding the extraordinary item  as a result of lower selling prices  currency impacts and the absence of affiliate earnings from businesses divested in  some of which was mitigated by lower raw material costs

item a 
market risk discussion the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since it denominates its business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  funds its operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchases raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
the company s operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
the company has established policies governing its use of derivative instruments and does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risk in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on the company s business operations  the risk management system uses sensitivity analysis as a primary analytical technique 
the analysis assumes simultaneous shifts in those rates and quantifies the impact of such shifts on the company s earnings  cash flows  and fair values of assets and liabilities during a one year period 
the range of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflects the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and prices chosen 
foreign exchange rate risk short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the company covers known and anticipated operating exposures by using foreign currency exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries primarily germany  france  italy  the united kingdom  sweden and spain  as well as brazil  mexico  canada  japan  and australia 
the company has evaluated the effects of the introduction of the euro on its business operations and has included the euro in its operating plans and foreign currency risk management process to minimize any adverse impact 
the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation and depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
long term exposures to foreign currency exchange rate risk are managed primarily through operational activities 
the company manufactures its products in a number of locations around the world  hence  has a cost base in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund its business operations 
the company s current strategic policy is to maintain from to of floating rate debt  with a long term average of 
an basis point move in interest rates would affect the value of the company s floating and fixed rate instruments  including short and long term debt and derivative instruments  but would not have a material impact on earnings per share or the company s financial position 
eighty basis points approximate of the company s weighted average rate on its worldwide debt 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain raw materials such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  and butanol under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material prices have historically had material impacts on the company s earnings and cash flows  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
the company uses commodity derivative instruments to modify some of the commodity price risks 
assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  the potential change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts held at december   would not be material when compared with the company s earnings and financial position 
forward looking statements this market risk discussion and the estimated amounts presented are forward looking statements that assume certain market conditions 
this assessment does not include the potential effects on interest rates or debt policy that may be adopted following the business acquisitions discussed above under acquisitions and divestitures 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to such acquisitions and any unforeseen developments in relevant financial markets  including asia and latin america 
the methods used above to assess risk should not be considered projections of expected future events or results
