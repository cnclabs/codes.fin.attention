when interest rates decline  prepayment speeds generally accelerate due to homeowners refinancing their mortgages at lower interest rates 
this may result in the proceeds being reinvested at lower interest rates 
rising interest rates may decrease the assumed prepayment speed 
slower prepayment speeds may extend the maturity of the security beyond its estimated maturity 
therefore  investors may not be able to invest at current higher market rates due to the extended expected maturity of the security
