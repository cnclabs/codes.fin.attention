during  the company launched one of its lead products  prepared for the launch of its second lead product  conducted additional clinical studies  built a sales and marketing sales team and developed the transplant pharmacy tm 
the company s accumulated deficit from inception through december  was  the company s operating loss has increased each year since inception and losses are expected to continue in the near future as a result of a number of factors including the uncertainty in the timing and the amount of revenue to be earned upon product sales  expenses required for product development  clinical trials and marketing and sales activities 
in addition  the company s business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the success of its research and development efforts  litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  in particular  litigation with novartis regarding sangcya  obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process  reliance on third parties to manufacture products or product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with health care reform measures 
even if the company s products appear promising at various stages of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the product candidates will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  be uneconomical to market  be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties or be unacceptable to providers  payors or patients 
additional expenses  delays and losses of opportunities that may arise out of these and other risks could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
results of operations acquisition 
on september   the company completed the acquisition of pasteur merieux connaught s pmc organ transplant business known as imtix 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the resulting wholly owned subsidiary of the company  named imtix sangstat  is dedicated to the research  development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals for transplantation 
the aggregate purchase price of approximately million consisted of million paid upon closing and a non interest bearing note of million payable over five years as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the note payable is discounted at a rate of and is included in notes payable 
in addition  the company will pay pmc certain royalties on imtix sangstat product sales 
the aggregate purchase price and approximately million of acquisition costs were allocated to the net tangible assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  identifiable intangible assets and purchased in process research and development 
the purchased in process research and development of approximately million was charged to the company s operations in the third quarter of and represents the value of products that had not yet reached technological feasibility and no alternative future use 
the estimated value for the in process technology was determined using the income approach which discounted to present value the cash flows expected to be derived from the in process products 
the projections were based on historical trends and future expectations of the acquired company s revenue and expenses to be generated from the in process products 
the discount rate used reflected the risk associated with development of the in process products 
the company currently intends to continue the development of the acquired in process products and has not yet determined if it will be successful in its efforts to complete as the safety and efficacy of these products has not yet been determined 
the determination of the products safety and efficacy is expected to be completed in with estimated costs to complete the clinical studies less than  depending on the outcome of the ongoing clinical studies  further studies may be required to fully assess the feasibility of the acquired in process products 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to various specified intangible assets and is being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to fourteen years 
amortization for the year ended december  was total revenues 
net product sales for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  or from the increase was due primarily to an increase in sales of the transplant pharmacy and sales of therapeutic products in europe as a result of the acquisition of imtix 
net product sales for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or from the increase primarily reflected a increase in sales of monitoring products and an increase in sales of the transplant pharmacy 
revenue from collaborative agreements was  in  an increase of  or from the company received milestone payments of  in from amgen under the collaborative distribution agreement for sangcya and sang in certain territories outside the united states  in  the company received an initial payment of  from amgen under that same collaborative distribution agreement cost of sales and manufacturing 
cost of sales and manufacturing expenses were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or from the increase was substantially due to additional costs associated with increased sales of therapeutic products and the transplant pharmacy 
for the year ended december   cost of sales and manufacturing expenses were  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the increase reflected declines of and in costs of sales for monitoring products and thymoglobulin  respectively  offset by the increased sales volume of the transplant pharmacy 
research and development 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or over the increase is primarily due to spending for thymoglobulin  azathioprine and xenoject tm and the addition of imtix research development spending in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   research and development expenses were  reflecting an increase of  or from the prior year 
the increase primarily reflected continued expansion of clinical and regulatory activities for sangcya  sang and thymoglobulin 
sangcya tm  oral solution  the company s first cyclosporine product candidate  was approved by the us food and drug administration fda on october   as a bioequivalent formulation to neoral r for the prevention of rejection in organ transplant recipients 
sangcya was launched in the us in the fourth quarter of and has also been filed in europe under the mutual recognition process 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of  or over the increase is principally due to the company s expansion of its commercial infrastructure and launch and pre launch activities to help support the us launches of the company s first two therapeutic products  sangcya and thymoglobulin  the growth of the transplant pharmacy and the addition of imtix expenses in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the increase reflected the company s expansion of its marketing and sales staff for its therapeutic products  sangcya and thymoglobulin and continued growth of the transplant pharmacy 
interest income net 
interest income was  for the year ended december   which represented a decrease of  from the prior year 
the decrease reflects the decrease in the average cash balance available for investment as a result of the company s use of cash for operating activities 
for the year ended december   interest income was  an increase of  over  which was primarily due to the increase in average cash balances available for investment as a result of the sale of equity securities during and interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  over the same period in interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  over the same period in income taxes 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a provision of  for european income taxes based upon income earned from imtix in the fourth quarter 
a tax provision was not recorded in or net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss of  in and a loss of  in these increases primarily reflect increases in research and development  including clinical trials and regulatory affairs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   the company has financed its operations substantially from proceeds of approximately  from public offerings of its common stock and  from private placements of equity securities 
during the years ended december   and  the company s net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in each year above is substantially due to the increased amount of net loss incurred in each year 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and total assets of net cash used in investing activities totaled  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  and resulted substantially from the company s net purchases of short term investments 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was  which was primarily the result of the maturity of short term investments  offset by cash used for the purchase of imtix 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were substantially comprised of proceeds received from the sale of common stock during the respective periods offset in part by net repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations 
although the company has no current contractual obligations relating to capital expenditures  it anticipates that capital expenditures  primarily for its united states operations  will aggregate approximately million during the company utilizes various computer software packages in the conduct of its business activities 
the company has conducted a preliminary assessment of its internal information technology systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
based on this preliminary assessment  the company currently has no reason to believe that its internal information technology systems are not year compliant 
the company intends to continue to assess the year compliance of its internal information technology systems 
to date  the company has not made any material expenditures related to the year compliance of its internal information technology systems and the company does not currently anticipate spending any material amounts for year remediation 
there can be no assurance that year errors or defects will not be discovered in the company s internal information technology systems 
in the event year errors or defects are discovered in the company s internal information technology systems and the company is not able to remedy such errors or defect in a timely manner or the cost to remedy such errors or defects is significant  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company has not yet fully assessed the extent of its exposure  or investigated the plans of its suppliers and vendors to address their exposures to these year problems  and thus the company may be adversely impacted should these organizations not successfully address this issue 
at december   the company had federal  state and foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately   and  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
in addition  the company had available research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state tax purposes 
the company s ability to realize the benefits of the nol and credit carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in the respective taxing jurisdiction prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to avail itself of such benefits 
furthermore  utilization of the net operating loses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loses and credits before utilization 
the company anticipates the need  within the next twelve months  to raise additional funds through additional financings  including private or public equity and or debt offerings and collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be raised on favorable terms  if at all  or that discussions with potential collaborative partners will result in any agreements 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including its research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and the costs of manufacturing scale up and working capital requirements for inventory and financing of accounts receivable 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
sangcya approved in uk on february   the company announced that the united kingdom granted  under their national regulatory procedure  marketing approval to sangcya tm oral solution cyclosporine for prevention of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients as well as other immunosuppressant indications 
based on this approval  sangstat intends to seek additional european member state approvals through the mutual recognition procedure 
this application was submitted to the uk medicines control agency on february  with the aim of benefiting from the european community mutual recognition procedure for obtaining regulatory approval in multiple member states 
this procedure involves the filing of the submission in only one member state eg uk  which upon grant of marketing authorization  then serves as the reference member state for the other concerned member states 
in accordance with the ec legislation  once this procedure is initiated  these concerned member states are required to mutually recognize the initial authorization and summary of product characteristics within days 
this is expected to result in sangcya approval in most european countries during the second half of the european market is roughly equivalent to the us market in size and scope 
there are approximately  new transplant recipients per year concentrated in just transplant centers and over  transplant recipients in europe who require daily lifelong immunosuppressive therapy from the time of transplant surgery 
estimated sales of cyclosporine exceeded million in europe and million in the uk 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires an enterprise to report  by major components and as a single total  the change in its net assets during the period from non owner sources 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise s business segments and related disclosures about its products  services  geographic areas and major customers 
the adoption of this statement in did not impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas will be effective for the company s year ending december  management believes that this statement will not have a significant impact on the company 
risk factors history of operating losses  future profitability uncertain 
sangstat was incorporated in and has experienced significant operating losses since that date 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was  the company s operating expenses have increased from approximately million to million to million over the last three fiscal years 
total revenues increased from approximately million to million to million while net losses from operations increased from approximately million to million to million over the last three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues from product sales or profitable operations 
to date  the company s product revenues have been substantially dependent on sales of certain organ transplantation products  including a limited number of monitoring products  international sales of thymoglobulin and lymphoglobuline  and limited initial sales in north america of thymoglobulin and sangcya 
future growth dependent on sales of key products 
the company expects to derive a majority of its future revenues from sales of sangcya  sang and thymoglobulin 
sangcya and thymogloblin were launched in november and february  respectively and the company expects to file for regulatory approval for sang in the first half 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the sale of these key products  individually or collectively  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of these key products could be adversely affected by competitive changes  regulatory matters  manufacturing or supply interruptions  number of contracts with managed care providers and group purchasing organization  factors affecting production  marketing or pricing actions  changes in the prescribing practices of transplant physicians  reimbursement practices of third party payors  product liability claims or other factors 
in particular  with respect to sangcya and sang  sales may be affected by perceptions of both patients and physicians regarding use of a generic version of a critical  life saving therapeutic  the availability and acceptance of the cyclotech device to be used in connection with sangcya  and intense competitive pressure from novartis as well as the novartis litigation 
see uncertainty of market acceptance  substantial competition  and litigation with novartis 
litigation with novartis 
on february   novartis pharmaceuticals corporation filed a lawsuit case number in federal district court for the district of delaware against the company alleging infringement of united states patent  a cyclosporine technology patented by novartis ag the novartis patent does not cover neoral but rather a separate delivery system not used in the neoral formulation 
novartis seeks the following relief i a finding that sangstat willfully infringed the patent  ii to permanently enjoin sangstat from infringing the novartis patent  iii treble damages  and iv reasonably attorneys fees  costs and expenses 
sangstat s answer is due april  and discovery will not begin until after the answer is filed 
sangstat believes that the lawsuit is without merit and that it does not infringe the novartis patent 
sangstat intends to defend itself vigorously against this claim 
although the company is optimistic that this dispute will ultimately be resolved favorably to the company  the course of litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome 
as a result of the novartis suit  sangstat could be enjoined from selling sangcya for a significant period of time or ultimately be prevented from selling sangcya 
should this happen  the company does not believe it would be able to obtain a license from novartis on acceptable terms because the company believes cyclosporine is an important product for novartis and that novartis would not want to diminish its profits from this product by licensing it on acceptable terms to the company 
failure to obtain any such required license could prevent the company from selling sangcya entirely  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
the litigation  whether or not resolved favorably to the company  is likely to be expensive  lengthy and time consuming  will divert management s attention and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
sang is not covered by this lawsuit and the company does not believe that this lawsuit will have an impact on the regulatory approval of sang novartis pharmaceuticals corporation sued the fda on february  in the united states district court for the district of columbia case number cv alleging that the fda did not follow its own regulations in approving sangcya in october the lawsuit against the fda appears to be based on arguments similar to those used in the failed citizen s petition in which novartis alleged that because neoral and sangcya  both oral solutions  are based on different formulation technologies  they should be classified as different dosage forms 
novartis asks that the court rescind the ab rating that was given to sangcya 
loss of the ab rating would prevent sangcya from being automatically substitutable for neoral oral solution  which would impede the marketing of sangcya 
the company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and that the fda will prevail in this matter 
although the company is optimistic that this dispute will ultimately be resolved favorably to the company  the course of litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome 
novartis requested relief  if granted  could have a significant negative economic impact on sangstat 
in order to defend its interests vigorously  sangstat filed a motion for leave to intervene in this lawsuit on february  the court has not yet ruled on this motion 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating losses have increased each year since inception and losses may be expected to continue in the near future as a result of a number of factors including the uncertainty in the timing and the amount of revenue earned upon product sales and achievement of research and development milestones  funding under collaborative research agreements and expenses required for product development  clinical trials and marketing and sales activities 
the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on other factors  including the introduction of new products by the company s competition  regulatory actions  market acceptance of the company s products  adoption of new technologies  manufacturing capabilities  legal actions and third party reimbursement policies 
no assurance of successful product development 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce and market its products and product candidates 
there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained  or that any products if developed and introduced will be successfully marketed 
the company s product candidates will require extensive development  testing and investment  as well as regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
cost overruns due to unanticipated regulatory delays or demands  unexpected adverse side effects or insufficient therapeutic efficacy would prevent or substantially slow down the development effort and ultimately would have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will be successful and that any given product will be approved by appropriate regulatory authorities or that any product candidate under development will be safe  effective or capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at an economical cost  will not infringe the proprietary rights of others or will achieve market acceptance 
thymoglobulin was approved for sale in the us in december sangcya was approved for sale in the us in october and in the uk in january the company has also filed an nds for marketing approval of thymoglobulin in canada 
the company s other principal pharmaceutical product candidates  including the company s capsule formulation of cyclosporine sang  the company s formulation of azathioprine  antilfa  and allotrap  have not been approved for commercial sale in any country 
sangstat has developed a generic azathioprine for use in transplantation as an adjunct therapy in chronic immunosuppression and has completed its pharmacokinetic and human bioequivalency trials 
the company intends to seek market approval by filing an anda with the fda 
in  the company voluntarily withdrew its k for a two component celsior product and has completed a multi center clinical trial for a redesigned one component  ready to use celsior product candidate 
the results of an initial phase ii safety study in europe showed that allotrap was safe and well tolerated in the study 
toxicology studies have been completed in a second generation peptide  allotrap pre clinical development has indicated that this second generation peptide may be more potent than allotrap as a result  the company may decide to pursue the development of allotrap rather than allotrap the company has designed the allotrap clinical trials to comply with regulatory standards in france as well as in the united states  so that it may use the data to support its nda to the fda 
there can be no assurance that such data will be accepted by the fda 
the use of allotrap peptides to promote graft acceptance in humans is novel and unproven and there can be no assurance that such peptides will prove to be safe or effective in humans for any clinical indication  including for any transplant type or at any dosage 
the company has no clinical evidence in humans that allotrap peptides will be effective in promoting graft acceptance or safety in transplant patients and there can be no assurance that allotrap or any other product candidates based on allotrap peptides will receive marketing approval or become viable commercial products 
certain of the company s monitoring product candidates are in development and have not been approved for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that these product candidates will be successfully developed  receive regulatory approval or be marketed on a profitable basis 
see business products and product candidates 
risks associated with the manufacture of sangcya  sang and thymoglobulin 
cyclosporine is particularly difficult to manufacture and there can be no assurance that sangcya or sang can be manufactured in commercial quantities at an economical cost 
the company has contracted for commercial scale production of cyclosporine bulk material ie the active ingredient of cyclosporine for sangcya and sang from both gensia sicor and a second fda approved supplier 
gensia sicor received approval in july of an anda from the fda for the manufacture of bulk cyclosporine drug substance 
sangstat s second supplier of bulk cyclosporine drug substance has also been approved by the fda 
the company has also separately subcontracted the manufacture of sangcya and sang product with eli lilly 
there can be no assurance that such third parties will perform satisfactorily and any such failure may delay regulatory approval  product launch  impair the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis  or otherwise impair the company s competitive position  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
thymoglobulin is also difficult to manufacture and there can be no assurance that sangstat will be able to manufacture commercial quantities at an economical cost 
the company recently acquired the imtix division of pmc  including certain manufacturing capabilities with respect to thymoglobulin 
from time to time  prior to the acquisition  certain batches of thymoglobulin did not meet manufacturing specifications  resulting in a shortage of thymoglobulin product for commercial sale 
since the acquisition  all batches of thymoglobulin have met manufacturing specifications 
even after the acquisition  the company still relies on pmc for certain important manufacturing services  including  but not limited to  quality assurance and quality control  as well as lyophilization 
there can be no assurance that pmc will continue to provide these critical manufacturing services to the company in an effective manner or without interruption 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing difficulties with respect to thymoglobulin in the future 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
whether or not regulatory approvals are obtained  uncertainty exists as to whether the company s products will be accepted by the market 
in particular  there can be no assurance that the company s product candidates would obtain significant market share 
factors that may affect the willingness of patients  physicians  pharmacists and third party payors to convert to sangstat products  if approved  include price  perception of bioequivalence  perceived clinical benefits and risks  ease of use  other product features and brand loyalty 
in addition  other factors may limit the market acceptance of products developed by the company  including the timing of regulatory approval and market entry relative to competitive products  the availability of alternative therapies  the price of the company s products relative to alternative therapies  the availability of third party reimbursement and the extent of marketing efforts by the company or third party distributors or agents retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that patients  physicians  pharmacists  or third party payors will accept the company s products 
in particular  with respect to sangcya and sang  if product approval is obtained  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in taking significant market share away from novartis 
volatility of common stock price 
the market prices for securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including the company  have historically been highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of new therapeutic products by the company or its competitors  announcements regarding collaborative agreements  governmental regulation  clinical trial results  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  litigation  public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by the company or others  comments made by securities analysts and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
in particular  the realization of any of the risks described on this k could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price 
ability to manage growth 
the company has recently experienced a period of expansion of its operations that has placed a strain upon its management system and resources 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage an increasing number of employees 
the company s failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for its products and to preserve its trade secrets 
the company holds patents and pending patent applications in the united states and abroad 
the company s patents involve specific claims and thus do not provide broad coverage 
there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications or any claims of these patent applications will be allowed  or found to be valid or enforceable  that any patents or any claims of these patents will provide the company with competitive advantages for its products or that such issued patents and any patents issued under pending patent applications will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by the company s competitors 
the company has not conducted extensive patent and prior art searches with respect to many of its product candidates and technologies  and there can be no assurance that third party patents or patent applications do not exist or could not be filed in the united states  europe or other countries which would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that any claims in the company s patent applications would be allowed  or found to be valid or enforceable  or that any of the company s products would not infringe on others patents or proprietary rights in the united states or abroad 
the allotrap peptide family is being developed under an exclusive  worldwide license from stanford university 
although stanford has filed patent applications with respect to such technology  there can be no assurance that  other than the patent application that has issued  any of the claims of such patent applications will be allowed  or found to be valid or enforceable and as to the issued patent  that the claims will be found to be valid or enforceable 
there can be no assurance that sangstat can manufacture  or have manufactured  formulate or commercialize sangcya and sang without infringing patent or other proprietary rights of novartis or other third parties 
the company has recently been sued by novartis for patent infringement 
see litigation with novartis 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue 
since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  sangstat cannot be certain that it was the first to discover compositions covered by its pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such compositions 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of its issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how which it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the company has registered or applied for registration of the names of most of its products under development or commercialized for research and development use 
however  there can be no assurance that any trademark registration will be granted or not challenged by competitors 
see business patents and proprietary technology 
substantial competition 
the drugs being developed by the company compete with existing and new drugs being created by pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostics companies and universities 
many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities  as well as substantial marketing  manufacturing  financial and managerial resources and represent significant competition for the company 
the principal factors upon which the company s products compete are product utility  therapeutic benefits  ease of use  effectiveness marketing  distribution and price 
with respect to thymoglobulin  sangcya  sang  and azathioprine  the company will be competing against large companies that have significantly greater financial resources and established marketing and distribution channels for competing products 
for example  novartis currently controls virtually of the worldwide cyclosporine markets and has significantly greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against novartis 
to date  the company has a limited number of contracts with managed care providers and group purchasing organizations 
the company s future sales will be dependent on the company s ability to enter into contracts with these entities 
the drug industry is characterized by intense price competition and the company anticipates that it will face this and other forms of competition 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that the company will be able to keep pace with technological developments 
many of the competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by the company and may be more effective and less costly 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and obtaining regulatory approvals of such products 
accordingly  the company s competitors may succeed in commercializing products more rapidly than the company 
for example  the company believes that the degree of market penetration of sang is dependent in part on whether the company is the first company to market a bioequivalent formulation of cyclosporine 
the company believes that other companies may be developing cyclosporine formulations that may be marketed as generic equivalents 
were these competitors to develop their products more rapidly and complete the regulatory process sooner  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
treatments for the problems associated with transplantation that the company s products seek to address are currently available 
for example  sandimmune and neoral  marketed by novartis  compete with sangcya and sang orthoclone okt  marketed by johnson johnson and atgam  marketed by pharmacia upjohn inc  simulect  marketed by novartis  and zenapax  marketed by roche ltd  would be competitive with thymoglobulin 
prograf marketed by fujisawa pharmaceutical co 
ltd  cellcept  marketed by roche ltd 
and imuran  marketed by glaxo wellcome ltd 
would be competitive with sangcya  sang and azathioprine 
all of such products are commercially available for use as immunosuppressive drugs and are widely prescribed 
in addition  one lambda inc  pel freez  biotest diagnostics corp  and genetic therapy  inc market products for pre transplant hla monitoring and abbott laboratories markets a cyclosporine level post transplant monitoring device  all of which are widely used 
additional therapeutics and monitoring products are available or are under development by these and other parties including  but not limited to american home products corp 
rapamycin  bristol myers squibb ctla  and dupont merck viaspan  and other companies including  but not limited to abbott cyclosporine  medimmune inc  biotransplant  inc  and ivax corp 
all of the aforementioned competitive and other drugs are commercially available for use as immunosuppressive drugs and are widely prescribed 
to the extent these therapeutics  monitoring products or novel transplant procedures address the problems associated with transplantation on which the company has focused  they may represent significant competition

limited manufacturing capability 
in  the company leased a manufacturing facility in lyon  france as part of the imtix transaction for the manufacture of thymoglobulin 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  imtix sangstat  manufactures thymoglobulin 
there can be no assurance that imtix sangstat will continue to meet fda standards governing good manufacturing practices gmp 
the company currently relies on pmc to perform certain services for the company in the manufacturing process 
see risks related to the manufacture of sangcya  sang  and thymoglobulin 
the company lacks facilities to manufacture any of its other drugs or drug candidates in accordance with current gmp prescribed by the fda 
the company generally relies on third parties to manufacture compounds other than thymoglobulin and devices for commercial sales and clinical trials  including sangcya  pra stat  cyclotech  sang  allotrap  azathioprine and celsior and has contracted for commercial production of these compounds and devices 
there can be no assurance that manufacturers will meet fda standards governing gmp or other regulatory guidelines  that any bla s required for manufacturing will be filed  reviewed and approved  or that any third party manufacturer will pass a preapproval inspection 
the company is currently purchasing allotrap for clinical trials from ucb bioproducts sa ucb located in belgium  and intends to contract with ucb for commercial production 
the company has contracted for commercial scale production of cyclosporine bulk material for sangcya and sang with gensia sicor as well as with a second fda approved manufacturer 
in addition  the company has contracted for the production of its finished formulated sangcya and sang with eli lilly and company 
the company has also contracted for manufacture of azathioprine bulk material with an fda approved manufacturer and with a separate fda approved manufacturer for production of its finished formulated azathioprine product candidate 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into secondary commercial scale manufacturing contracts or that any other third party arrangements can be established on a timely or commercially reasonable basis  or at all 
the company will depend on all such third parties to perform their obligations effectively and on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that such parties will perform and any failures by third parties may delay clinical development or submission of products for regulatory approval  or otherwise impair the company s competitive position which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  the manufacturing of drug candidates involves a number of technical steps and requires meeting stringent quality control specifications imposed by government regulatory bodies and by the company itself 
additionally  such products can only be manufactured in facilities approved by the applicable regulatory authorities 
because of these and other factors  the company may not be able to replace its manufacturing capacity quickly or efficiently in the event that its manufacturers are unable to manufacture their products at one or more of their facilities 
for certain of its potential products  the company will need to develop its production technologies further for use on a larger scale in order to conduct human clinical trials and produce such products for commercial scale at an acceptable cost 
the transplant pharmacy 
establishing the transplant pharmacy as a viable distribution system entails a number of risks including the company s ability to enter into agreements with transplant centers to utilize the transplant pharmacy s services  compliance with state regulations regarding pharmacy licensing and compliance with federal and state laws regulating payments for referrals for health care services 
on november   the office of the inspector general oig of the department of health human services issued an advisory opinion which stated that the placement by a pharmacy of a licensed pharmacist at a hospital transplant center might constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti kickback statute section bb of the social security act 
the company did not request the advisory opinion and the advisory opinion only applies to the requesting party 
the company believes that the operation of the transplant pharmacy differs from the fact pattern set out in the advisory opinion and does not constitute prohibited remuneration 
there can be no assurance that the oig will agree with this analysis  in which case the transplant pharmacy s program may be modified so that it would no longer include an on site pharmacist at transplant centers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing the transplant pharmacy as a viable distribution method for the company s products and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and equity security price risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than two years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally has the ability to hold fixed income investments until maturity and therefore does not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
equity price risk 
the company holds a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have a material impact on the company 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial positions at december  actual results may differ materially
