item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  this report contains predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from any future performance suggested in this report as a result of the factors  including those discussed in risk factors  elsewhere in this report 
overview pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of products that improve existing therapeutic approaches to cancer  atherosclerosis and retinal disease 
we are currently in a multicenter international phase iii clinical trial of xcytrin to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy of tumors that have spread to the brain resulting from a variety of cancers  including those of the lung and breast 
we have completed a phase ii clinical trial for lutrin as a photosensitizer to evaluate its safety  tolerability and efficacy for use in the photodynamic therapy of recurrent breast cancers to the chest wall 
through our cooperative research and development agreement  the national cancer institute intends to conduct several phase i clinical trials of xcytrin and lutrin  each for a variety of additional cancer indications 
we have also completed a phase i clinical trial for antrin to evaluate its safety and efficacy for photoangioplasty treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease involving the blood vessels of the lower extremities 
in addition  alcon is conducting a phase i ii clinical trial of optrin for the photodynamic therapy of patients with a degenerative disease of the retina caused by growths of small blood vessels in the retina known as age related macular degeneration 
alcon is conducting this trial under a evaluation and license agreement that gave alcon the right to conduct worldwide development  marketing and sales of optrin for ophthalmology indications 
also in  we entered into a collaborative agreement with nycomed to sell and market lutrin for cancer therapy outside the united states  canada and japan 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales  and we do not expect to receive product revenues for at least the next several years 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing research and development costs  in addition to costs related to clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our products under development  and obtain required regulatory clearances and successfully manufacture and market our products 
see risk factors all of our product candidates are in development and we cannot be certain that any of our products under development will be commercialized  acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will harm our business  we have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to have losses in the future failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and our capital requirements are uncertain and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future 
results of operations comparison of years ended june   and revenues 
our revenues for the years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended june  resulted primarily from a milestone payment from alcon and contract revenue from nycomed and alcon 
revenues in fiscal consisted primarily of  in license revenue and  in contract revenue associated with the nycomed and alcon agreements 
the  of revenue in fiscal was the result of milestone payments from e z em related to the signing of a european sales and distribution agreement and receipt of marketing approval in the united kingdom for citra vu 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the  or increase from to was due primarily to increased clinical trial costs  greater drug purchases for use in clinical trials and greater personnel costs 
research and development expenses incurred in connection with research and development contracts were  for the year ended june  we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue development of our products 
the  or increase in research and development spending in from was due primarily to supporting clinical trials for xcytrin  lutrin and antrin 
such costs included clinical product supplies  clinical site costs and personnel 
research and development expenses incurred in connection with research and development contracts were  for the year ended june general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
the  or increase for compared to primarily resulted from increases in personnel and related expenses and costs associated with hiring new employees 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  for compared to the increase in fiscal expense was primarily related to personnel and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal included approximately  of financing costs related to a planned public financing which was withdrawn due to market conditions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal interest income  net of interest expense 
interest income  net of interest expense  was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in each of and was primarily the result of interest earned on higher average cash balances from a public equity offering completed in february our cash equivalents and investments consist primarily of fixed rate instruments that are not subject to interest rate risk 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes that have occurred during the past four fiscal years  we believe that utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital have been primarily private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as grant revenues  interest income and property and equipment financings 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accounts payable 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in the year ended june  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of investments  partially offset by purchase of investments and property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of net purchases of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
in february  we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in february  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of million 
in november  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for proceeds of million 
we filed and had declared effective on april   a registration statement on form s covering resales of the securities purchased in both private placements 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that the net proceeds of this offering  together with our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the calendar year however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
at june  we had approximately million in cancelable purchase commitments with three suppliers of drug components and final bulk drug substance and one supplier of lasers 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be certain that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors risks related to pharmacyclics our capital requirements are uncertain and we may have difficulty raising capital in the future 
impact of year many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead  the so called year problem 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
we have assessed our exposure for year related problems focusing on four potential areas of exposure internal information systems  scientific equipment  facility support systems and the readiness of significant third parties with whom we have material business relationships 
internal information systems we are using a number of computers and computer programs across all of our operations 
we have performed an inventory of our computer equipment and computer programs 
to date  we have identified no significant internal information systems as non year compliant and we have enacted procedures to assure that all purchases of new systems are year compliant 
scientific equipment we have taken an inventory of the major pieces of our scientific equipment 
we believe all major pieces of our scientific equipment to be year compliant 
facility support systems we have also taken an inventory of our major facility support systems such as communications  security and building maintenance systems 
we believe all major systems to be year compliant 
third parties with major business relationships we depend upon a large number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to us 
these include financial institutions  suppliers  vendors  research partners and governmental entities 
we have begun surveying all of our major vendors and other third party interests to determine whether their systems are year compliant 
we cannot guarantee that all of our key suppliers  partners and others will achieve year compliance in a timely manner 
the failure of our vendors and partners to successfully address the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fully address our year issue 
such failures could materially affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our contingency plan to minimize the risks associated with year issues consists primarily of arranging for adequate supplies of bulk drug substances to ensure that our ongoing clinical trials are not interrupted 
our contingency plan has been substantially implemented as of august we expense external and internal costs specifically associated with addressing year issues as incurred 
to this point  these costs have not been material and we do not expect such costs to be material in the future 
we cannot be certain  however  that our assessment of year s potential impact on us will not change as we complete our assessment  or that year will not ultimately cause a material disruption in our business 
market risk our cash and cash equivalents  investments and debt are comprised primarily of short term fixed rate instruments 
accordingly  we are not subject to interest rate risk to any significant degree 
one of our cancelable drug supply agreements is denominated in a foreign currency 
we have not entered into any agreements or transactions to hedge the risk associated with potential fluctuations in currencies  accordingly  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to this contract 
while we may enter into hedge or other agreements in the future to actively manage this risk  we do not believe this risk is material to our financial statements
