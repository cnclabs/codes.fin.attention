item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview the company operates the only independent  non bank owned automated teller machine atm network in central europe  as a service provider to banks and other financial institutions 
its principal source of revenue to date has been transaction fees from a growing number of atms installed in hungary  poland  the czech republic  croatia  france  germany  and the uk 
the company was formed and established its first office in budapest in june in may  the company opened its second office  in warsaw 
during  the company also opened offices in berlin  zagreb  prague  paris and bucharest 
in the company opened an office in london and acquired arkansas systems inc with offices in little rock  orlando and budapest 
the company maintains corporate offices in kansas city and budapest 
to date  euronet has devoted substantially all of its resources to establishing and expanding its atm network through the addition of atms to its proprietary network and through providing outsourcing management services for bank owned atms 
euronet installed its first atm in hungary in june  and at the end of  the company had atms installed 
an additional atms were installed during in hungary and poland and as of december   the company s atm network consisted of atms 
during the company installed a further atms to bring the total network to atms at december  a further atms were added in to bring the total network size at december  to  atms including  owned by the company and owned by banks but operated by the company 
euronet has expanded its outsourcing services to include not only the operation of existing atms owned by banks  but also the installation and management of company owned atms for banks in their branches or off site locations 
both types of outsourced management agreements involve the operation of atms in return for monthly management fees or a guaranteed monthly level of transaction fees  ensuring a certain level of return for the company 
on december   the company acquired arksys  a us company which produces electronic payments systems software for retail banks for million 
this acquisition will significantly affect the company s sources of revenues and expenses  since it will add significant revenues and expenses from software sales to the company s atm operation and outsource atm management revenues 
with the expansion of operations  the company increased the number of its employees from as of december   to as of december  and as of december  the country operations and employee head counts as of december  are as follows united states  hungary  poland  germany  croatia  czech republic  france  romania  and united kingdom 
the company s expansion of its network infrastructure and administrative and marketing capabilities has resulted in increased expenditures 
further planned expansion will continue to result in increases in general operating expenses as well as expenses related to the acquisition and installation of atms 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from atm transaction fees since inception 
the company receives a fee from the card issuing banks or international card organizations for atm transactions processed on its atms 
as the company continues to focus on expanding its network and installing additional atms  the company expects that transaction fees will continue to account for a substantial amount of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s existing contracts with banks and international card organizations provide for reduced transaction fees with increases in transaction volume 
as the company s transaction levels continue to increase  the average fee it receives per transaction will decrease 
however  the company expects that because the decrease in transaction fees is tied to an increase in transactional volume  the overall revenues of the company should increase despite the fee discounts 
however  the company expects that transaction levels may  however  be negatively impacted if all or a large part of the transaction fees are passed on to cardholders by client banks 
the transaction volumes processed on an atm in any given market are affected by a number of factors  including location of the atm and the amount of time the atm has been installed at the location 
the company s experience has been that the number of transactions on a newly installed atm is initially very low and takes approximately three to twelve months after installation to achieve average transaction volumes for that market 
accordingly  the average number of transactions  and thus revenues  per atm are expected to increase as the percentage of mature atms operating in the company s network increases 
the company sells advertising on its network by putting clients advertisements on its atm screens and the receipts 
the company believes that advertising revenues will increase as it expands its network and continues to market this service 
the company also generates revenues from atm network management services that it offers to banks that own proprietary atm networks 
the company believes that revenues from this service will increase in the future 
the company has had substantial increases in the level of operations  including atms operated and total personnel in  and in addition  the company s acquisition of arksys in december significantly changed the nature of the operations by adding an entirely new line of business 
as a result  a comparison of the company s results of operations between such years is not necessarily meaningful 
the company s normal recurring expenses consist of atm operating costs  salaries and benefits  selling  general and administrative expenses  and  depreciation and amortization 
atm operating costs are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of atm site rentals  atm installation costs  maintenance  telecommunications  cash delivery and security services to atms and interest on network cash 
atm operating expenses will necessarily increase as the company s network expands 
salaries and benefits will increase as staff are added with the development of new markets and expansion of existing markets including software sales and installation 
while selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenditures are anticipated to increase with the company s expansion into new markets and the introduction of new products  these expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues total revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was due primarily to the significant increase in transaction revenues resulting from the increase in transaction volume attributable to additional network connections to credit and debit card issuers and an increase in the number of atms operated by the company during these periods 
the company had atms  atms and  atms installed at the end of  and  respectively 
transaction fee revenue represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for the year ended december  transaction fees charged by the company vary for the three types of transactions that are currently processed on the company s atms cash withdrawals  balance inquiries and transactions not completed because authorization is not given by the relevant card issuer 
transaction fees for cash withdrawals vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction while transaction fees for the other two types of transactions are generally substantially less 
other atm network revenues included in atm network and related revenue of   and  for the years ended december   and consisted primarily of advertising  revenue  driving contract revenue and other revenue such as consultancy services revenue

operating expenses total operating expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and from  for the year ended december  the increases in both years were due primarily to costs associated with the installation of significant numbers of atms and expansion of the company s operations during the periods

the gain represents the difference between the allocated carrying value of the face value of the debt repurchased of  less the consideration paid of  offset by the write off of the allocated unamortized deferred financing costs of  the company has not retired the bonds repurchased 
net loss the company s net loss increased to  during the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has sustained negative cash flows from operations and has financed its operations and capital expenditures primarily through the proceeds from the issue of dm denominated notes payable  the company s public equity offering  equipment lease financing and private placements of equity securities 
the net proceeds of such transactions  together with revenues from operations and interest income have been used to fund aggregate net losses of approximately  and investments in property  plant and equipment 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  at december  the company had  of restricted cash held as security with respect to cash provided by banks participating in euronet s atm network  to cover guarantees to a customer and as deposits with customs officials 
the company expects to continue to generate losses from operating activities  and negative cash flow while it concentrates on the expansion of its atm network business and development of arksys service delivery capabilities 
as a result of the company s strategy of continuing expansion and increasing its market share  the company s net losses are expected to continue for the company expects improved results in the year there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that the company will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations in any future period 
if the company cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operations  it may not be able to meet its debt service or working capital requirements 
the company leases the majority of its atms under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and 
as of december  the company owed  under such capital lease arrangements 
at december   the company had contractual capital commitments of approximately  the company expects that its capital requirements will increase in the future as it pursues its strategy of expanding its network and increase the number of installed atms 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for the months ending december  could total approximately million  primarily in connection with the acquisition of atms  scheduled capital lease payments on existing lease obligations  and related installation costs 
aggregate capital expenditures of the company for and for such purposes could reach approximately million in the company s existing markets  including western and central europe 
these requirements contemplate planned expansion in existing markets 
acquisitions of related business and investments in new markets in furtherance of the company s strategy may require additional capital expenditures 
on june   the company sold  units in a public offering  each consisting of dm  principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due on july  the notes and  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock

it is possible that the company may seek additional equity or debt financing in the future 
the indenture entered into in connection with the offering of the notes limits  but does not prohibit  the company and its subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
if an opportunity to consummate a strategic acquisition arises or if one or more new contracts is executed requiring a more rapid installation of atm machines or a significant increase in the number of atm machines in any market area  the company may require substantial additional financing for such purpose and to fund its working capital needs 
such additional financing may be in the form of additional indebtedness which would increase the company s overall leverage 
balance sheet items cash and cash equivalents the increase of cash and cash equivalents to  at december  from  at december  is due to the receipt in june of the net proceeds of dm  approximately  from the public offering of senior discount notes due on july  less approximately  cash paid for the acquisition of arksys and amounts used for fixed asset purchases and to fund operating losses in the period

although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual requests may materially from those in the forward looking statements are a result of various factors  including technological and business developments in the local card and electronic banking markets affecting the transaction and other fees which the company is able to charge for its services  foreign exchange fluctuations  competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services and software providers  the company s relationships with its major customers  sponsor banks in various markets and international card organization  unanticipated year problems  and changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure in  of the company s revenues were generated in poland and hungary  as compared to in this figure will be substantially reduced with the additional revenues from arksys and the company s expanded atm network in germany 
while in hungary the majority of revenues received are to be us dollar denominated  this is not the case in poland  where the majority of revenues are denominated in polish zloty 
however the majority of these foreign currency denominated contracts are linked either to inflation or the retail price index 
while it remains the case that a significant portion of the company s expenditures are made in or are denominated in us dollars the company is also striving to achieve more of its expenses in local currencies to match its revenues 
the company anticipates that in the future  a substantial portion of the company s assets  including fixed assets  will be denominated in the local currencies of each market 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the deutsche mark  as opposed to the us dollar  on the central european currencies  the company expects that the currencies of the markets where the proceeds from the offering will be used will fluctuate less against the deutsche mark than against the dollar 
accordingly  the company believes that the issuance of deutsche mark denominated debt will provide  in the medium to long term  for a closer matching of assets and liabilities than a dollar denominated issuance would 
inflation and functional currencies in recent years  hungary  poland and the czech republic have experienced high levels of inflation 
consequently  these countries currencies have continued to decline in value against the major currencies of the oecd over this time period 
however  due to the significant reduction in the inflation rate of these countries in recent years  none of these countries are considered to have a hyper inflationary economy 
therefore  since poland will is no longer considered hyper inflationary for and a significant portion of the company s polish subsidiary s revenues and expenses are denominated in zloty  the functional currency of the company s polish subsidiary is the zloty 
the functional currency of the company s hungarian subsidiary will continue to be the us dollar 
it is expected that the functional currency of the company s czech subsidiary will also be the us dollar 
germany and france have experienced relatively low and stable inflation rates in recent years 
therefore  the local currencies in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia  like germany and france  has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of the croatian company is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to the factors mentioned above  the company does not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company continually reviews inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries that it operates in
