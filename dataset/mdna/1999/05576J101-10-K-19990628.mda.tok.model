item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general btg  inc btg or the company is an information systems and technical services company providing complete solutions to a broad range of the complex systems needs of the united states government and its agencies and departments the government and other commercial and state and local government customers 
the company is an industry leader in providing systems analysis and engineering services  solutions development  systems integration  and computer based operations and support 
the company s revenues have historically been derived from both contract activities and product sales 
contract revenue is typically less seasonal than product sales but fluctuates month to month based on contract delivery schedules 
contract revenue is characterized by lower direct costs than product sales  yet generally requires a higher relative level of infrastructure support 
year to year increases in contract revenue have generally resulted from increases in volume  driven by additional work requirements under government contracts 
product sales are characterized by higher direct costs than contract revenue  however  indirect expenses associated with product sales are generally lower in comparison 
the company s operating performance is affected by both the number and type of contracts held  the timing of the installation or delivery of the company s services and products  and the relative margins of the services performed or products sold 
in general  the company recognizes its highest margins on its most specialized systems engineering and software development projects and lower margins on sales of commercial off the shelf products 
in recent years  the company identified what it believed to be a dramatic change in the federal product reselling market 
the government s product purchasing strategy shifted its focus to contract vehicles such as general services administration gsa schedules  which heavily weigh lowest price as opposed to best value 
as profit margins in the product reselling business began to shrink during fiscal  it became increasingly clear to the company that only the largest product resellers could generate the volume of sales required to compensate for the decreasing product margins 
accordingly  on february   btg entered into an asset purchase agreement under which btg completed the sale to government technology services  inc gtsi of i certain of the assets  principally inventory and property and equipment  and ii certain of the existing contracts and outstanding customer orders of the btg operating division responsible for reselling computer hardware and software products the gtsi transaction 
as consideration for the sale  btg initially received million and  shares of a new series of preferred stock of gtsi  designated series c cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock 
ten percent of the purchase price was placed in escrow for a one year period to serve as security for the company s indemnification for potential obligations under the acquisition agreement 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  the preferred stock received by the company converted into  shares of gtsi common stock once approved by the gtsi shareholders on may  in july  the company sold million shares of its gtsi holdings for million  resulting in a loss of approximately  in february  btg and gtsi entered into a series of agreements in order to settle a number of issues which arose after the gtsi transaction 
under the terms of the new agreements  btg transferred to gtsi all of the cash portion of the escrow and  shares of gtsi common stock 
in addition  btg granted gtsi the option to purchase  at a per share price of  the remaining million gtsi shares held by btg 
in addition  as part of the february agreements  btg agreed to novate to gtsi certain contracts awarded to btg s product reselling division in a prior year 
also in february  btg and gtsi entered into an agreement under which gtsi issued a note payable to btg as consideration for the purchase by gtsi of  shares of the gtsi common stock held by btg 
these shares were sold at per share 
the note  which bears interest at  is payable in three annual installments beginning on january  results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated i the percentage of revenues represented by certain income and expense items and ii the percentage period to period increase decrease in such items percentage of revenue fiscal year ended period to period march  increase decrease of dollars compared to compared to revenues contract revenue product sales total revenues direct costs contract costs as a of contract revenue cost of product sales as a of product sales total direct costs as a of total revenues indirect  general and administrative expenses amortization expense restructuring charge a operating income loss interest expense  net unusual charge a equity in earnings of affiliate gain on sale of investments  net b merger related costs a a other expenses a income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and extraordinary items provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss before extraordinary items extraordinary loss a a net income loss a there was no expense for this item in a comparison year 
b the percentage year to year increase is in excess of 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal this decrease consisted of a million increase in contract revenue offset by a million decrease in product sales 
the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to an increase of million of revenue recognized under contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of nations  inc in june  million of revenue generated by new contracts of the company s delta research division  and a net increase in work performed at several civilian government agencies 
these increases were offset by a reduction in activity under the company s integration for command  control  communications  computers and intelligence ici contract of million 
the decrease in product sales was primarily attributable to the gtsi transaction 
included in product sales during fiscal was million of revenue resulting from certain contracts awarded to btg s product reselling business unit in a prior year which were subcontracted to gtsi as part of the gtsi transaction the royalty contracts 
pursuant to an agreement entered into as part of the gtsi transaction  gtsi assumed substantially all of the future performance requirements of the royalty contracts under a subcontractor agreement and btg received a fee of or on total product sales made under such contracts 
in the last quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with gtsi whereby it agreed to novate the royalty contracts to gtsi and  accordingly  will receive no future revenue from such contracts 
the company expects that revenues from product sales will be substantially lower in future periods 
in both fiscal and  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from contracts or subcontracts with  and product sales to  the government  on either a direct or indirect basis 
direct costs  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting the decreased proportion of total revenues derived from product sales  which typically have higher direct costs than do revenues generated from service contracts 
contract costs include labor costs  subcontractor costs  material costs and other costs directly related to contract revenue 
contract costs as a percentage of contract revenue were virtually the same for fiscal and at and  respectively 
as a percentage of product revenues  cost of product sales in fiscal was  an increase over the reported in fiscal primarily due to product sales recognized from the royalty contracts for which gross margins of to were earned 
indirect  general and administrative expenses include the costs of indirect labor  fringe benefits  overhead  sales and administration  bid and proposal  and research and development 
indirect  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the gtsi transaction which resulted in a reduction in the number of company employees  space requirements  and other related indirect costs  and to the company s increased emphasis on cost containment 
expressed as a percentage of total revenues  indirect  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to  from in fiscal  principally reflective of the decreased proportion of total revenues derived from product sales  which typically have lower indirect  general and administrative expenses than do revenues generated from service contracts 
amortization expense  which includes the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  decreased by  in fiscal as compared with the previous year 
this decrease was  in large part  attributable to certain intangible assets which were written off in fiscal in connection with the company s restructuring of its operations and divestiture of its product reselling division 
restructuring charges of million were recognized during fiscal and represented an increase in the estimated accrued restructuring costs recorded during fiscal specifically  the fiscal charges related to an adjustment to the estimated impairment of certain assets of the product reselling division and additional facility costs 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to refocus the company on its core business and historical strengths in order to improve operating results 
the million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal included million associated with the write down of goodwill recorded in connection with past acquisitions of certain product reselling companies  million associated with the loss recorded on the sale and disposal of certain of the assets related to the gtsi transaction  million in estimated reserves for certain prepaid software licenses initially purchased for resale by the product reselling division  and million in estimated reserves for future facility and equipment lease commitments of the product reselling division 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal the company maintains a revolving line of credit facility the credit facility to fund its working capital needs 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facility 
the decrease in fiscal was due to a significantly lower average balance outstanding under the company s credit facility and to the repayment in april of the company s long term debt obligations 
cash used to reduce outstanding debt was primarily generated from the collection of outstanding receivables and from proceeds made available from sales of investments 
unusual charges of million were recognized by the company during fiscal as a result of the agreements entered into by btg and gtsi during february equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal resulted from the company s interest in an unincorporated joint venture 
the joint venture entity  which was with an unrelated company  was formed for the purpose of performing under a specific contract which ended on march  in june  the company acquired a common stock interest in gtsi for which the equity method of accounting was used 
btg s share of the earnings reported by gtsi of  for the three months ended june  was recognized by btg during fiscal in july  btg sold a substantial portion of its interest in gtsi and no longer reported its investment in gtsi under the equity method 
gains recognized on sales of investments during fiscal was million  down from the million reported in fiscal and resulted primarily from the company s liquidation of its remaining shares in cisco systems  inc cisco  which it acquired as a result of its ownership of the wheelgroup corporation 
see liquidity and capital resources 
other non operating costs decreased by approximately million  or  from the comparable period of the prior year 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to approximately million of merger related costs which were incurred in fiscal in connection with the termination of a planned acquisition 
income tax expense  as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes  was during fiscal in fiscal  the company recognized an income tax benefit due to the pre tax loss experienced by the company 
as a percentage of the loss from continuing operations before income taxes  this benefit was 
during fiscal  the company was able to realize portions of the net operating losses generated by the product reselling division for which a valuation allowance had been established in fiscal as a result  the effective income tax rate for fiscal was lower than would otherwise have been expected 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was significantly and adversely affected by the write down of goodwill recorded in connection with the company s divestiture of its product reselling business 
the costs associated with such write downs are not deductible for income tax return purposes 
the company recorded losses of  and million  net of income taxes  in fiscal and  respectively  from the discontinuance of the non strategic operations of a retail computer store and a subsidiary operating in the internet access market  both of which were owned and operated by btg 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to contract revenue and million was attributable to product sales 
the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to million of revenue recognized under contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of nations and an increase of million in revenue recognized under the company s ici contract 
the remaining increase in contract revenue during fiscal resulted from a variety of federal and commercial contracts involving both systems engineering and integration work 
the increase in product sales was primarily driven by shipments made under two new government contracts the us army pc contract pc  which was awarded to the company in october and first generated revenue in june  and a us department of state contract state department  which was awarded to the company in april in addition  the company experienced an increase in sales under gsa schedule contracts  either directly from the company s gsa schedule contracts or from sales to other prime contractors with gsa schedule contracts  and under the company s tda contract with the us department of treasury 
the overall increase in product sales was offset  in part  by a reduction in orders fulfilled under both the systems acquisition support services sass and tennessee valley authority tva contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from contracts or subcontracts with and product sales to the government  as compared with for fiscal direct costs  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal contract costs as a percentage of contract revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased revenues generated from the ici contract  from contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of nations  and from an increase in revenues generated from systems integration and networking contracts 
the ici contract  the contracts acquired through the acquisition of nations  and the company s systems integration and networking contracts require higher levels of materials  subcontractor involvement and or other direct costs than does btg s historical contract base  which has a more labor intensive  higher gross margin profile 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was due  in large part to both competitive market pressures in the product reselling environment and to the startup costs associated with several large idiq government contracts for which shipments began during fiscal during fiscal  the company shipped a significant amount of products under the pc and state department contracts  which both provided for extended warranty coverage 
the estimated costs of this extended warranty coverage have been included in cost of product sales during fiscal indirect  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the overall volume of business as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of total revenues  indirect  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal to  from in fiscal amortization expense  which includes the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  increased by  or in fiscal as compared with the previous year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of nations 
restructuring charges totaling million were incurred during fiscal primarily as a result of the company s divestiture of its product reselling business 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to refocus the company on its core business and historical strengths in order to improve operating results 
the total restructuring charges recorded in fiscal included million associated with the write down of goodwill associated with past acquisitions of certain product reselling companies  million associated with the loss recorded on the sale and disposal of certain of the assets of the divested product reselling division  million in estimated reserves for certain prepaid software licenses initially purchased for resale by the product reselling division  and million in estimated reserves for future facility and equipment lease commitments of the product reselling division 
interest expense for fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase was due principally to the significant growth in revenue in fiscal as compared with the prior year  which resulted in higher receivable and inventory balances  thereby resulting in a higher level of interest expense related to the financing of these operating assets 
in addition  higher interest costs were incurred in fiscal due to interest paid on borrowings related to the company s acquisition of nations in june as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense decreased in fiscal to from in fiscal equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was  in fiscal  a decrease of million from the prior year 
this income resulted from the company s interest in an unincorporated joint venture entity which was formed for the purpose of performing under a specific government contract 
decreased income from this source was attributable to the lower demand for products under the associated contract which ended on april  the company recorded a gain on the sale of investments in fiscal of million as the result of the sale of its ownership interests in cisco  which it acquired as a result of its ownership of the wheelgroup corporation 
see liquidity and capital resources 
merger related costs of million were incurred by the company during fiscal these costs were primarily attributable to the termination of the company s planned acquisition of micros to mainframes  inc m t m 
on august   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger the agreement with m t m under which btg agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of m t m for cash and common stock consideration valued at approximately million 
on february   the agreement  as subsequently amended  was terminated 
pursuant to the agreement  btg paid m t m a  termination fee 
in addition  the company paid m t m million for additional out of pocket expenses and in exchange for a release from future liability which may arise as a result of the termination of the agreement 
income tax expense  as a percentage of income before income taxes  was during fiscal  however  due to the pre tax loss experienced by the company during fiscal  there was an income tax benefit which  as a percentage of the loss before income taxes  was 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was significantly and adversely affected by the write down of goodwill recorded in connection with the company s divestiture of its product reselling business 
the costs associated with such write downs are not deductible for income tax return purposes 
the company recorded losses of million and  net of income taxes  in fiscal and  respectively from the discontinuance of the non strategic operations of a retail computer store and a subsidiary operating in the internet access market  both of which were owned and operated by btg 
in fiscal  the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million  net of income taxes  from the early extinguishment of outstanding notes payable 
inflation approximately and of the company s contract revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were under cost reimbursement type contracts  under which inflationary increases are borne by the customer 
although the company performs on several multi year  fixed price and time and materials contracts  under which it bears the risk of inflationary pressures on its costs  to date it has not been materially adversely affected by inflation 
in addition  the company s product sales generally have not been affected by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources principally as a result of the company s significant focus in fiscal on the collection of outstanding receivables from its divested product reselling division  operating activities provided cash of approximately million 
this was primarily reflective of a decrease in receivables of approximately million offset by the reduction in accounts payable of million  primarily associated with the vendor obligations remaining from the product reselling division 
in addition  million was provided from the collection of income taxes receivable which resulted from fiscal operating losses used to claim previously paid taxes 
cash flow of million was provided by investing activities in fiscal  primarily from the million of proceeds received from sales of company investments  offset by the approximate million of cash used for the purchase of stac  inc in january in march  pursuant to a merger agreement entered into by the wheelgroup corporation wgc and cisco  a publicly traded technology company  btg s ownership interest in wgc was converted into approximately  common shares of cisco 
the shares of cisco initially received by btg were unregistered  however  in accordance with the merger agreement  were registered shortly after the merger was consummated 
in fiscal  the company sold all of its cisco shares for approximately million and used the proceeds from these sales to retire outstanding debt 
gains of approximately million and million were recognized during fiscal and  respectively  as a result of these transactions 
during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with oracle corporation under which oracle is to provide btg with an enterprise wide financial and project management software system  and related technical support and implementation services 
during fiscal  the company anticipates spending approximately million on costs associated with the implementation of the system 
the company believes that the system will be fully implemented by april  during fiscal  approximately million was used in financing activities  primarily to reduce outstanding amounts under the credit facility million and to retire outstanding long term debt instruments million 
in connection with the financing of the acquisition of stac  the company issued million of notes payable in january million of these notes were repaid during march during fiscal  approximately million was provided from financing activities primarily as a result of million in net advances under the credit facility  million in new promissory term notes  and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under certain employee benefit plans 
these financing sources were offset by million in payments under both outstanding debt and capital lease arrangements 
the million in new promissory term notes were used to retire outstanding subordinated notes payable 
during fiscal  million was provided from financing activities primarily as a result of million in net proceeds received from a follow on public common stock offering 
at march   working capital was approximately million compared with working capital of million at march  this decrease is attributable to several factors including the sale of investments million the collection of receivables million and the collection of the income tax receivable million 
cash generated from these current assets was used to reduce not only current liabilities such as accounts payable million and outstanding debt million  but also the current and noncurrent portions of the line of credit million 
as a result of the net application of the company s working capital  btg s current ratio improved from at march  to at march  and the ratio of total liabilities to total equity was reduced from at march  to at march  credit facility 
the credit facility is a secured revolving credit facility consisting of two revolving promissory notes provided to the company and its subsidiaries by nationsbank  na nationsbank and fleet capital corporation in the principal amount of up to million 
on november   the company amended the credit facility to provide for  among other things  an extension of the maturity date of the facility to august  under the amended agreement  the principal amount outstanding under the credit facility may not exceed the lesser of i million or ii a defined borrowing base  which is a variable amount calculated by aggregating a specified set of the company s accounts receivable and unbilled costs 
if for any quarter during the term of the credit facility  the average daily outstanding principal balance under the credit facility is less than of the commitment amount million unless otherwise reduced  the company must pay a commitment fee at the rate of three eighths of one percent per annum on the difference between the commitment amount and the daily outstanding principal balance under the credit facility during such quarter 
interest on revolving loan advances made under the credit facility is  at the option of the company  either i the nationsbank prime rate  or ii libor plus a percentage ranging from to depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all assets of the company and includes certain financial and other covenants restricting  among other things  changes in capital structure  mergers  acquisitions  sales of assets  changes of operations  purchases and redemptions of stock  additional indebtedness  payment of dividends and other payments to shareholders  investments  capital expenditures  a net loss by the company for any fiscal quarter and certain other matters without the approval of the lenders 
at march   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility 
at march   the company had available borrowings under its credit facility of million 
the company believes that funds available under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements of the company s ongoing operations for the next months 
year compliance the year or yk problem arises from the standard use of two digit fields to hold the four digit year in a date 
the scope of the yk problem goes beyond simply fixing the calendar so that it rolls over correctly on december  in many systems  the two digit year field with the characters triggers special logic 
this was a standard and accepted practice for decades 
the problem also includes leap year calculations  specialized clock functions ie  global positioning system  and embedded systems 
embedded systems can be looked at as computer chips or automated devices involving software  microcode  firmware  and eprom program code 
these automated devices typically perform their intended functions over long periods of time without error  unless there is a physical defect in the code 
typical systems that contain embedded software are fire suppression systems  security systems  elevator control  lighting management systems  and telephone systems 
virtually every item that uses electricity is a possible candidate for a year problem 
systems that do not properly recognize date related information could  among other things  fail to operate  operate incorrectly  or fail to exchange data properly with other systems 
this could result in major system failures and the disruption of business operations 
assessments of the global impact of this problem vary  and it is therefore not possible to predict what the impact on the company may be 
the company has established a year committee to conduct this analysis  to lead the company s efforts to achieve yk compliance  and to advise senior management on risks and solutions 
the committee has initiated a number of assessments  gathered information  conducted tests  and prepared plans to address the year problem 
the company expects this process to continue throughout calendar and into the first quarter of calendar however  there can be no assurances that corrective action will be completed before any year problems occur  or that costs will not be greater than anticipated 
the company has reviewed its internal operations  including the physical plant  computer programs  and other systems on which its operations rely 
based on this assessment  an action plan has been developed 
it includes obtaining supplier certifications  obtaining and installing vendor provided software upgrades  and replacing affected systems where necessary 
specifically  the core financial system utilized by the company was not yk compliant 
during december  the system was upgraded to a yk compliant version 
this upgrade included vendor supplied applications  new versions of operating systems  and new hardware 
full end to end system tests were conducted and discrepancies corrected 
it should be noted that the company s fiscal began on april  and the upgraded accounting system has had no yk related problems 
the cost of this upgrade was included in the normal  annual maintenance expenses for the system 
other corporate systems have been evaluated to determine appropriate courses of action 
embedded systems principally security systems have been examined and upgraded to yk compliant versions 
the company expects to complete remediation of all critical internal systems by september in the ordinary course of its business  the company spends a portion of its information technology budget on maintenance and upgrades to its corporate information technology infrastructure 
during fiscal  the company incurred an additional  for specific year remediation  out of a total information technology budget of million 
these costs have been expensed as incurred 
the estimate for year remediation  in addition to ordinary information technology expenses  for fiscal beginning april is  out of a total information technology budget of million 
a portion of this amount will be used to acquire capital equipment which would not otherwise have been purchased until a future period 
the company believes there is a risk that other parties with whom it deals may be relying on systems that could experience year problems 
this includes the company s largest customer  the government  whose year remediation efforts are known to be underway 
based on information currently available  the company does not believe it will suffer a materially adverse affect by the year problems of the government or its other customers 
it should be noted that should yk noncompliance by the government or any other customer disrupt the company s receipt of payments  the company would expect to increase its short term borrowings  which could materially increase the company s interest expenses 
in addition  there is a risk that customers will reduce funding on contracts awarded to the company in order to fund year remediation 
to the extent the company is not the provider of that remediation  this would affect the company s revenues 
the company has taken steps to assure itself that the financial institutions  utilities  and service providers with whom it deals will not experience year problems that would materially and adversely affect the company 
in addition  the company has obtained commitments from suppliers of products for resale that such products will be yk compliant 
although the company believes that essential operations and services will not be affected  any failures or delays could disrupt the company s business and cause it to incur substantial expense 
the company has undertaken an assessment of the extent to which products it has developed and resold are yk compliant 
the company is aware that the distribution of non yk compliant products could give rise to customer claims against the company 
with respect to btg branded products  which it stopped manufacturing in  the company will provide  when and where appropriate  bios upgrades and software utilities  to bring such products to a level of year compliance  when possible 
the company cannot estimate the outcome of such claims or their effect on the company  but believes that most such claims  if any  would be without merit 
there can be no assurances that the company will not experience delay in  or increased cost associated with  the implementation of its year remediation plan  and the company s inability to implement such plan could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which are comprised of third party software  third party hardware that contains embedded software  and the company s own branded products 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include i corruption of data contained in the company s internal information systems  ii hardware failure  iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties eg  providers of electricity  phone service  water transport  etc  and iv the inability of the government or any other customer to make timely payments on company invoices 
the company is continuing to prepare its contingency planning  which will include among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitution of systems  if necessary 
the statements above describing the company s plans and objectives for handling year issues and the expected impact of the year issue on the company are forward looking statements 
those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed above 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  delays in executing the plan outlined above and increased or unforeseen costs associated with the implementation of the plan and any necessary changes to the company s systems
