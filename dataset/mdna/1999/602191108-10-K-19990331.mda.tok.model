item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements which are affected by important factors including  but not limited to  actions of competitors  termination of contracts at the convenience of the united states government  customer funding variations in connection with multi year contracts and follow on options that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
the company s military rugged business segment provides specialized computers and related peripheral equipment to the united states and foreign military defense departments 
equipment in this segment takes two primary forms 
the first of these is fully militarized products  usually designed especially for a particular mission area with demanding environmental and quality requirements 
the second of these is rugged products  usually based on a commercial baseline product  but adapted by the company to meet environmental and quality specifications that exceed the requirements for commercial products 
this entire segment has been impacted in recent years by reduced government spending and defense appropriations 
the militarized product area has been especially subject to defense budget cuts 
the military continues to reduce funding for the development and limited production quantities of highly customized systems and products 
the long design cycle for these programs creates an intangible cost in the form of rapid technological obsolescence 
some military programs that would have sought militarized equipment some years ago have modified the requirements to reflect a need for rugged or commercial products 
this trend has tended to benefit sales of the company s rugged product line 
even in the rugged product area  however  defense cuts have taken a toll 
competition in this area has become more keen in recent years  as many government contractors pursue fewer military programs 
through its commercial segment  the company develops  manufactures and markets commercial products primarily for transportation  telecommunications and in field maintenance markets 
its products are airborne printers  in flight cabin management and entertainment products  airline ticket and boarding pass printers  rugged public access internet terminals  mass storage devices  and derivatives of rugged hand held intel based computers and portable risc workstations originally developed for military applications

in april  the company purchased a new headquarters facility and related capital equipment located in montgomery  alabama 
the purchase was financed through a bank term loan and the proceeds of the offering of taxable revenue bonds the bonds by the alabama state industrial development authority which was completed january  the sida offering 
repayment of the bonds is secured by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by regions bank in an amount up to  which in turn is secured by a mortgage on the montgomery and troy  alabama facilities and a security interest in the equipment located at such facilities 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately   and  which will expire in  and  respectively  if not utilized 
in prior years  the company recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards of which realization was uncertain 
during and  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  and  respectively 
the reductions in the valuation allowance were attributable to the award of significant multi year government and commercial contracts during and  and the result of improved cost controls 
during  the company implemented additional cost improvements related to its manufacturing processes 
based on these initiatives  the significant increase in backlog over and the extended carryforward period allowed under current tax law  management of the company is of the opinion that a valuation allowance is not needed as of december  and the net deferred tax assets as of each year end reflects the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance can be adjusted in future periods as the probability of realization of the net deferred income tax asset changes 
the company believes that its working capital and capital requirement needs for its current lines of business and new product development will be met by its cash flow from operations and existing bank loan arrangements 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
year compliance as has been widely publicized  many computer and digital storage systems express dates using only the last two digits of the year and will thus require remediation or replacement to accommodate the year and beyond in order to avoid malfunction and resulting widespread business disruption 
the company has underway a year project that identifies the programs and infrastructure that could be affected by year issues and has implemented a plan to resolve those problems identified  on a timely basis 
the plan requires a considerable amount of internal resources devoted by the company to resolve the pertinent issues 
additionally  the company may have to recruit and retain external resources to assist with the actual implementation  testing and monitoring of the plan 
as of december   the company does not expect the ongoing resource cost of the year project to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently estimates the total cost of its year project will not exceed  over the life of the project 
costs associated with employees working on the year project will be expensed as incurred 
hardware and software purchases related to this project will be capitalized where appropriate 
the company does not anticipate additional significant costs as a result of the year issue 
the year project includes all management information systems which support ongoing business functions  other systems with computer based controls such as telecommunications  building environmental and security management and all suppliers and customers with which the company maintains a material business relationship 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place that will resolve the year issues affecting it and that this program is progressing normally and will be completed on a timely basis 
despite management s beliefs and the company s progress made on the year issues as of december   it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved 
in the event certain third parties are not able to resolve their own year issues  there could be circumstances in which the company would be unable to receive customer orders  manufacture  test and ship products  invoice customers or collect payments from those customers 
as part of its year project  the company will solicit written assurances from its customers and suppliers that each will be prepared for the year issue 
the company will perform periodic audits and tests of third party systems throughout the life of the project for year compliance 
however  there can be no certainty of total compliance from any or all of the third parties the company deals with on a daily basis 
the company has not yet seen the need for any widespread contingency plans to be developed for the year issue  but this will be monitored continuously as the company gains more information about the compliance programs of its suppliers and customers 
additionally  some risks of the year issues are beyond the control of the company and its suppliers and customers 
the company does not believe it can develop a contingency plan that will totally shield the company from an economic ripple effect throughout the entire economy should others fail to resolve their own year problems 
the costs of the company s year project and the timeliness of the completion of the project are based on management s best estimates  and reflect assumptions regarding the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the compliance plans of third parties and other uncertainties 
however  due to the complexity and pervasiveness of the year issue and in particular the uncertainty of third party compliance programs  there can be no assurances given that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities
