actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to i competition within the company s industries  ii changes in the economics of dentistry  including consolidation  reduced growth in expenditures by private dental insurance plans  and the effects of healthcare reform  which may affect future per capita expenditures for dental services and the ability of dentists to invest in or obtain reimbursement for the use of dental products  iii the effect of economic conditions  iv supply risks  including shortages and increases in the costs of key raw materials  v dependence on the services of the company s executive officers  and other key operations and technical personnel  vi legal proceedings see discussion of legal proceedings in part i  item of this form k  and vii the effects of the casualty loss at one of the company s manufacturing facilities see discussion of casualty loss below 
overview the company recorded a loss of  for fiscal primarily due to the significant professional and legal fees incurred by the company related to the dentsply litigation  which will continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company experienced a decrease in net revenues from international customers in the dental supplies segment and incurred expenses for the on going introduction of a new sales  marketing and growth strategy in the precision abrasives segment 
the precision abrasives segment has targeted four applications and markets to generate additional revenues for its precision lapping films and slurries 
the growth strategy is to target specific opportunities related to the finishing and polishing of computer heads  floppy disks  ceramic rolls and automotive parts 
in april  certain coating equipment utilized in the manufacture of abrasive materials in the precision abrasives segment was damaged at the company s montgomeryville facility 
the damage was caused by water seeping through a section of the facility s roof which was being repaired  and was left unprotected by an outside contractor during a rainfall 
minor amounts of raw material inventory were also damaged 
the company has received insurance proceeds to replace a portion of the damaged equipment and additional funds for repairs on the remaining equipment 
in addition  the company has filed additional claims for the resulting business interruption which are being reviewed by moyco s insurance provider 
the company will replace the affected equipment in the first quarter of fiscal  thus production capacity may be reduced during this time 
the company is continuing to utilize all practical initiatives to reduce the impact of the damaged equipment and has not experienced any significant reductions in production to date  however  the company has experienced decreased gross profit margins as a result of the damaged equipment and any reduced production capacity in fiscal could have a material impact on the future sales and operating income of the precision abrasives segment 
an accurate evaluation of the ultimate impact on these areas has not yet been made 
summary the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the company s key financial information by segment 
for the year ended june net sales dental supplies    precision abrasives    gross profit dental supplies    precision abrasives    operating income loss dental supplies    precision abrasives    results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales in fiscal totaled  a decrease of  from fiscal sales of  net sales in the dental supplies segment decreased  primarily due to a decrease in international sales offset by an increase in the sales of the company s proprietary and patented endodontic root canal instruments

the decrease in gross profit percentage for the precision abrasives segment is attributable to the casualty loss experienced at the company s montgomeryville facility which caused production interruptions and the use of less efficient manufacturing processes during the period subsequent to the loss 
operating expenses decreased  from  of net sales in fiscal to  of net sales in fiscal this decrease was a result of a  decrease in research and development expenses as a result of costs incurred in fiscal in connection with certain research and development fees paid to nanophase  as well as the investment of funds during the same period to refine the company s cmp slurry products 
sales and marketing expenses increased  from  of net sales in fiscal to  of net sales in fiscal primarily as a result of additional cooperative advertising and education seminars sponsored by the company offset by lower sales commissions

gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the dental supplies segment increased primarily due to improvements in the manufacturing process at thompson since the acquisition and a shift in product sales to higher margin proprietary and or patented products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the precision abrasives segment decreased due to wage and price increases by various vendors 
sales and marketing expenses increased  from  of net sales in fiscal to  of net sales in fiscal partially as a result of the thompson acquisition and partially due to increased royalty payments and advertising and promotional spending by the company

the company is constantly evaluating its capital structure and considering opportunities for strategic alliances  mergers  acquisitions  secondary offerings  private placements or other transactions 
the company continually evaluates and considers possible acquisition and or merger opportunities 
among other items  the company would consider the following factors in determining whether or not to pursue an acquisition or alliance including i synergy with the company s current lines of business products  ii growth potential  iii return on investment and iv technologies 
however  at this time  none of the above opportunities are planned or in process 
the company believes that inflation has not  and will not  have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which must be adopted by the company in the year ending june   provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
as the company does not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities  the adoption of this pronouncement is expected to have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the statement also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage and post implementation operations stage in an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
as the company s current policy falls within the guidelines of sop  the adoption of this pronouncement is expected to have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risks associated with the year i 
background the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions and information  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
ii 
readiness efforts the company does not believe that it has material exposure to the year issue with respect to its own information and non information systems technology 
the company has reviewed its existing information and non information systems technology and they either correctly define the year field in its programs with four digits or will be replaced before year issues will arise 
in addition  the company conducted an analysis to determine the extent to which its major vendors systems insofar as they relate to the company s business posed year issues 
based upon this analysis the company does not believe it has material exposure to year issues with respect to its major vendors systems  however  the failure of a major vendor to satisfactorily complete the conversion of its systems or a final conversion that is ultimately incompatible with the company s systems could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company also faces potential loss of revenue from customers who may have year issues 
currently  the company is conducting a review of its customers but is unable to predict how and to what extent its operations may be effected by year issues at its customers  however  year issues at a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
iii 
current status the expected completion date of the review of customer systems is october iv 
costs historical and estimated costs directly related to year issue remediation at the company have been and are expected to be immaterial as the company s systems have been and will be upgraded on a normal replacement schedule with only immaterial opportunity costs of company personnel to ensure new systems and third parties are year compliant 
v 
risk assessment based upon current information related to the progress of its major vendors and service providers  management has determined that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
this determination is based on the ability of those vendors and service providers to renovate  in a timely manner  the products and services on which the company s systems rely 
however  the company can give no guarantees that the systems of these suppliers will be timely renovated 
the company is developing in contingency plans to address third party year risks  realizing that some disruption may occur despite its best efforts 
the company is in the process of developing those contingency plans for each critical system in the event that one or more of these systems fail 
risk factors the statements contained in this form k that are not historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
additionally  from time to time  the company or its representatives have made or may make forward looking statements  orally or in writing 
such forward looking statements may be included in  but are not limited to  press releases  oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
these forward looking statements reflect the company s views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance and are  generally  but not exclusively  identified by the use of such terms as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  project  estimate  believe  goal  or continue  or comparable terminology that involves risks or uncertainties

additionally  the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
the risk factors identified in the cautionary statements below could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested in these forward looking statements 
also  the company may  from time to time  set forth additional risk factors on forms q and k 
however  the risk factors listed below or in future reports of the company are not exhaustive 
new risk factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all of such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements

the cautionary statements below are being made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
the company intends that all forward looking statements made  in whatever form  be considered subject to the act 
changes in the us dental health care system 
there has been substantial debate in the political arena related to prospective changes in the us health care system 
in addition  developments in both the public and the private sector may significantly affect the financing and delivery of dental health care in the united states  including the expansion of managed care programs  large dental practices  franchises  purchasing groups and industry consolidation 
cost containment has been a major element of these developments 
there can be no assurance that such changes in the financing and delivery of dental health care will not continue to affect dental capital equipment and supplies procurement patterns or dictate which procedures will be covered by applicable insurance or government funded or subsidized programs 
the company also cannot predict the extent or impact of future legislation or regulations 
competition 
the company faces substantial competition from other manufacturers 
competitive pressure could result in price competition or the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  which could have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the company is engaged in industries characterized by extensive research efforts 
advances in products and other discoveries or developments could render some of the company s products obsolete 
some of the companies with which the company competes or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater financial  technical and personnel resources than the company and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in evolving industries 
governmental regulation 
government regulation in the us and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacturing and marketing of many of the company s products and in the company s on going research and development activities 
specifically  dental devices are subject to united states food and drug administration fda approval or clearance before they can be utilized for clinical studies or sold commercially 
the process for obtaining the necessary approvals and compliance with applicable regulations can be costly and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that regulatory review will not involve delays or other actions adversely affecting the marketing and sales of the company s products 
there is no assurance the company will continue to be able to obtain required government approvals or successfully comply with such regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and failure to do so may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
further  there can be no assurances that more stringent regulatory requirements and or safety and quality standards will not be issued in the future with an adverse effect on the company s business 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable regulations of the fda  current regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the company s products are similarly subject to foreign regulating bodies 
typically  foreign bodies readily allow the company s products to be traded within their jurisdictions  based on the fact that the company s products are regulated by the fda 
however  there can be no assurance that such foreign bodies will not impose different  additional requirements that may materially hamper the company s ability to compete in overseas markets 
the company has received ce conformite european certification for its major dental product lines for european distribution and is constantly evaluating regulatory requirements in various territories throughout the world to ensure compliance with same 
patents and proprietary technologies 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
the company owns united states patents  japanese patent and a number of issued foreign patents and pending patent applications for its products 
the company plans to continue to patent inventions which may provide commercial benefit 
currently  the company has one patent application pending for a new endodontic instrument design 
in addition  the company is reviewing the possibility of filing several new applications related to both its dental and abrasives technologies 
the company treats its design and technical data as confidential  and relies on nondisclosure safeguards  such as confidentiality agreements  laws protecting trade secrets and agreements to protect proprietary information 
the company has incurred substantial costs in enforcing its patents against infringement by others and defending itself against similar claims of others 
although the company has been successful to date in disputes involving the validity and enforceability of its patents and in defending itself against claims by others of patent infringement  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in such matters in the future or that the company s patents or other proprietary rights  even if continuing to be held valid  will be broad enough in scope to enable the company to prevent third parties from producing products using similar technologies or processes 
with regard to the current dentsply litigation  the company remains confident that its intellectual property position is strong 
for more information  see discussion of legal proceedings in part i  item of this form k 
product development 
the company is actively engaged in identifying market needs and in developing products to satisfy those unmet needs 
such products are not necessarily in the company s current business segments 
the company attempts to validate the existence of such unmet needs as well as the potential revenues  costs and profits involved in satisfying such needs 
there is a material risk that the company s competitors may satisfy those needs with more effective or less expensive products 
there is also a material risk that the company s estimates of the economic potential from such unmet needs may be incomplete or inaccurate  or that the products which the company develops to meet such needs will be introduced on a timely basis or effective clinically or economically to gain market acceptance 
change in marketing approach 
with regard to the dental supplies segment  the company plans to fund and or sponsor various educational programs including  but not limited to seminars  lectures and demonstrations by industry opinion leaders 
while trade shows  dealer product presentations  advertising and other traditional marketing strategies will continue  the company is shifting its marketing emphasis to professional endorsement of products 
the company believes that this method of marketing will create greater demand for technique sensitive products 
with regard to the precision abrasives segment  the company plans to focus on higher margin products 
although the company believes that this transition will have a long term positive financial impact  no assurance can be given that the actions taken will provide the intended results  or that the company will not experience short term disruptions or an adverse impact of operations during the transition to this new marketing approach
