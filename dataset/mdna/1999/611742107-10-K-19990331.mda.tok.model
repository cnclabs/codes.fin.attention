overview a substantial part of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions 
for the period january  through december   the company completed acquisitions of which six  johnson  smith knisely inc jsk  tasa holding ag tasa  stackig  inc stackig  recruitment solutions inc  sunquest llc llc the smart group  and the consulting group international limited tcg  the pooled companies are being accounted for as poolings of interests 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of the pooled companies the mergers and our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the consummation of the mergers and  as a result  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows are presented as if the pooled companies had been consolidated for all periods presented 
in addition  for the period january  through december   we completed acquisitions  which were accounted for using the purchase method  with estimated annual gross billings of approximately million 
given the significant number of acquisitions in each of the periods presented  the results of operations from period to period may not necessarily be comparable 
gross billings refer to billings for advertising placed in telephone directories  newspapers  new media and other media  and associated fees for related services and fees earned for search and selection and related services and revenue from temporary contracting services 
while gross billings are not included in our consolidated financial statements  the trends in gross billings directly impact the total revenue earned 
for recruitment and yellow page advertising  we earn commissions based on a percentage of the media advertising purchased at a rate established by the related publisher  and associated fees for related services 
publishers typically bill us for the advertising purchased by clients and we in turn bill our clients for this amount 
generally  the payment terms with yellow page clients require payment to us prior to the date payment is due to publishers 
the payment terms with recruitment advertising clients typically require payment when payment is due to publishers 
historically  we have not experienced substantial problems with unpaid accounts 
we design and execute yellow page advertising programs  receiving an effective commission rate from directory publishers of approximately of yellow page gross billings 
in general  publishers consider orders renewed unless actively canceled 
in addition to base commissions  certain yellow pages publishers pay increased commissions for volume placement by advertising agencies

through our search selection services  we identify and screen candidates for hiring by clients based on criteria established by such clients 
we entered this business by acquiring in  jsk  the th largest executive search firm in the us according to kennedy publications  an official ranking service for the search industry  tasa  an international executive search firm  both of which were recorded as poolings of interest  and five regional european firms  including  tcg  which acquisition was recorded as a pooling of interests

our current interest rate under the agreement is libor plus basis points 
in addition  we have secured lines of credit aggregating million for our operations in australia  france  belgium and the netherlands of which approximately million was unused at december  we believe we will be able to fund our short term cash needs through funds from operations  our credit facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  canada and australia and  to a lesser extent  equipment leases 
the borrowings are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the financing agreement contains certain covenants which restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow  pay dividends  acquire businesses  guarantee debts of others and lend funds to affiliated companies and contains criteria on the maintenance of certain financial statement amounts and ratios

accordingly  such notes are included in long term debt  are generally payable over five years and totaled million at december  we intend to continue our acquisition strategy and promotion of our internet activities through the use of operating profits  borrowings against our long term debt facility and seller financed notes 
we believe that our anticipated cash flow from operations  as well as the availability of funds under its existing financing agreements and the net proceeds of our recent secondary public offering and access to public equity and debt markets  will provide us with liquidity to meet our current forseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  if we determine that conditions are favorable  we would consider additional corporate finance transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop is effective for financial statements for years beginning after december  sop provides guidance over accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use including the requirement to capitalize specified costs and amortization of such costs 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our capitalization policy 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
year issue many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and governmental agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
state of readiness we have developed a comprehensive plan to deal with the year issue 
the plan is an evolving document as we continue to acquire and integrate companies throughout the plan is intended to achieve three basic objectives to ensure that core systems will operate reliably through the year and beyond  to ensure that each business unit follows a consistent approach and adheres to project deadlines  and to track the status of all year efforts 
our year task force is currently conducting an inventory of and developing testing procedures for all software and other systems that it believes might be affected by year issues 
since third parties developed and currently support many of the systems used  a significant part of this effort will be to ensure that these third party systems are year compliant 
our plan is to confirm this compliance by obtaining representations by these third parties that their products are year compliant and through specific testing of these systems 
our plan is to complete this process prior to the end of the third quarter of until such testing is completed and such vendors and providers are contacted  we will not be able to completely evaluate whether our systems will need to be revised or replaced 
costs we expect to incur approximately million  globally  during in connection with identifying  evaluating and addressing year compliance issues 
most of these costs relate to time spent by employees and consultants in making our systems year compliant 
such costs  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks we are not currently aware of any year compliance problems relating to our systems that would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  without taking into account our efforts to avoid or fix such problems 
there can be no assurance that we will not discover year compliance problems in our systems that will require substantial revision 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third party software  hardware or services incorporated into our material systems will not need to be revised or replaced  all of which could be time consuming and expensive 
our failure to fix or replace our internally developed proprietary software or third party software  hardware or services on a timely basis could result in lost revenues  increased operating costs  the loss of customers and other business interruptions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the failure to adequately address year compliance issues in our internally developed proprietary software could result in claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation or breach of contract and related litigation  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are heavily dependent on a significant number of third party vendors to provide both network services and equipment 
a significant year related disruption of the network  services or equipment that third party vendors provide to us could cause our members and visitors to consider seeking alternate providers or cause an unmanageable burden on our technical support  which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that governmental agencies  utility companies  internet access companies  third party service providers and others outside of our control will be year compliant 
the failure by such entities to be year compliant could result in a systemic failure beyond our control  such as a prolonged internet  telecommunications or electrical failure  which could also prevent us from delivering our services to our customers  decrease the use of the internet or prevent users from accessing our web sites which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingency plan as discussed above  we are engaged in an ongoing year assessment and have not yet developed any contingency plans 
the results of our year simulation testing and the responses received from third party vendors and service providers will be taken into account in determining the nature and extent of any contingency plans 
fluctuations of quarterly results our quarterly commissions and fees are affected by the timing of yellow page directory closings which currently have a concentration in the third quarter 
yellow page publishers may change the timing of directory publications which may have an effect on our quarterly results 
our yellow page advertising results are also affected by commissions earned for volume placements for the year  which are typically reported in the fourth quarter 
our quarterly commissions and fees for recruitment advertising are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter  however  the cyclicality in the economy and our clients employment needs have an overriding impact on our quarterly results in recruitment advertising 
moreover  our recruitment advertising acquisition activity has had more of an impact on our recently reported quarterly results than any other factor

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads and exchange rate variability 
substantially all of the company s debt relates to a five year financing agreement with an outstanding principal balance of approximately million as of december  interest on the outstanding balance is charged based on a variable interest rate related to the higher of the prime rate  federal funds rate less of or libor plus a margin specified in the agreement  and is thus subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments 
the company also conducts operations in various foreign countries  including australia  belgium  canada  france  germany  japan  the netherlands  new zealand  singapore  spain and the united kingdom 
for the year ended december   approximately of our commmissions and fees were earned outside of the us and collected in local currency 
giving pro forma effect to the merger with m b  approximately of our revenue would have been earned outside the us for the year ended december  in addition  we generally pay operating expenses in the corresponding local currency and will be subject to increased risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the dollar 
we do not conduct any significant hedging activities
