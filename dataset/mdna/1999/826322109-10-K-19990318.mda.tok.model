income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes 
net income compared to revenues 
the company s total operating revenues for increased approximately to billion from million for the increase was primarily due to military contract revenue of million and an increase in premium revenue of million 
the military contract revenue is a result of the implementation of the tricare contract as well as the first seven months of health care delivery 
revenue under the tricare contract is recorded based on the contract price as agreed to by the federal government 
the contract also contains provisions which adjust the contract price based on actual experience 
the estimated effects of these adjustments are recognized on a monthly basis 
medical premium revenue from the company s hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased million  or 
excluding the effect of the kaiser texas acquisition in the fourth quarter of  premium revenue increased million  or 
the million increase in premium revenue reflects a increase in member months the number of months of each year that an individual is enrolled in a plan 
medicare member months increased which contributed to the increase in medical premium revenue 
such growth in medicare member months contributes significantly to the increase in premium revenues as the medicare per member premium rates are over three times higher than the average commercial premium rate 
the company s premium rates increased an average of to for its hmo commercial groups and in excess of for managed indemnity commercial groups 
the company also realized a slight increase in its capitation rate established by health care financing administration hcfa 
approximately of the company s nevada medicare members are enrolled in the social hmo medicare program

if the reimbursement for these members decreases significantly and related benefit changes are not made timely  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business 
specialty product revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to revenue growth of million in the workers compensation insurance operation offset in part by a decrease in administrative services and other revenue of million due primarily to the termination of the company s workers compensation administrative services contract with the state of nevada 
the company s workers compensation subsidiary signed a reinsurance agreement whereby a greater portion of premium is ceded thus reducing revenue 
the agreement results in a reduction of specialty product expense as discussed later in this section 
excluding the effect of the new reinsurance agreement  the workers compensation subsidiaries revenue would have increased million compared to the prior year 
professional fee revenue increased approximately million primarily due to the january acquisition of the operations of two medical clinics in southern nevada and the clinics acquired in the dallas ft 
worth area 
in addition approximately million of the increase in professional fees was due to the operations of total home care  inc thc which was acquired in august investment and other revenue increased approximately million over the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in invested balances and capital gains realized on the sale of investments 
medical and specialty product expense 
medical expenses as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees medical care ratio increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the prior period 
the increase in the medical care ratio was due to an increase in medicare members as a percentage of fully insured members  continued expansion in texas  northern nevada and arizona which have higher medical care ratios  higher pharmacy costs and the acquisitions of thc and two medical clinics for which costs of operations are included in medical expenses 
the cost of providing medical care to medicare members generally requires a greater percentage of the premiums received 
pharmacy costs increased as the management of the pharmacy benefit was transitioned from a capitated pharmacy benefits contract to in house management in the third quarter of the costs under such capitation contract were substantially below actual claims experience 
the medical care ratio is expected to further increase in due to the changes in member mix and pharmacy costs noted above 
included in medical expenses is the reversal of million of premium deficiency reserve that was used to offset losses on contracts from the kaiser texas operations that were acquired on october  specialty product expenses decreased approximately  or less than  due primarily to the implementation of the reinsurance agreement as discussed previously

under this agreement  the company reinsures of the first  of each claim  of the next  and of the next  the company receives a ceding commission from the reinsurer as a partial reimbursement of operating expenses 
excluding the effect of the reinsurance agreement  specialty product expense would have increased million compared to the prior year 
the combined ratio for the workers compensation insurance business was compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the reduction was due to a basis point decrease in the loss ratio and a basis point decrease in the expense ratio 
the decrease in the loss ratio was largely due to the new reinsurance agreement for losses occurring on and after july  and as a result of the company s ability to overlay and implement managed care techniques to the workers compensation claims 
the combined ratio excluding the effect of the new reinsurance agreement was for the year ended december  in addition  favorable loss development on prior accident years totalled million for the year ended december   compared to net favorable loss development of million for the comparable prior year period 
the favorable loss development is largely due to actual paid losses being below projected losses 
there can be no assurance that favorable development  or the magnitude thereof  will continue in the future 
the reduction in the expense ratio was largely due to a reduction in agents commissions  as a result of a ceding commission related to the new reinsurance agreement and from lower salaries and related benefits expenses 
the losses and loss adjustment expense ratio for the year ended december  reflect the company s current projection of the ultimate costs of claims occurring in the current as well as prior accident years 
such projections are subject to change and any change would be reflected in the income statement 
workers compensation claims are paid over several years

the increase was due in part to the company s participation in hcfa s social hmo program

however  these increases were offset in part by lower premium rates at medone health plan  an hmo acquired on december  the company s specialty product revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was due to specialty product revenue growth in the workers compensation insurance market of approximately million and an increase in administrative services and other of million due primarily to the acquisition of prime health  inc  at the end of some of this increase will be offset in the future by the loss of a portion of the state of nevada s self insured medical business

specialty product revenue and expense is primarily related to the workers compensation insurance business 
the combined ratio for the workers compensation insurance business was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the reduction was due to a basis point decrease in the loss ratio along with a basis point decrease in the expense ratio

in addition  the company had net favorable loss development on prior accident years totaling million compared to net favorable loss development of million for the comparable prior year period 
the favorable development is largely due to actual paid losses being below projected losses 
the majority of the favorable loss development occurred on the through accident years 
there can be no assurances that favorable development  or the magnitude thereof  will continue in the future

approximately million of the military accounts receivable balance is associated with monies owed to smhs as a result of providing health care services for a larger than expected beneficiary population 
smhs expects to receive this amount at the completion of the first bpa 
the bpa process serves to adjust the dod s monthly payments to smhs  because such payments are based in part on dod estimates for beneficiary population  beneficiary population baseline health care cost  inflation and military direct care system utilization 
as actual information is made available for the above items  quarterly adjustments are made to smhs monthly health care payment in addition to a lump sum adjustment for past months 
smhs accrues for such adjustments on a monthly basis as actual information is made available

such amounts are available for transfer to the holding company from the hmo and insurance subsidiaries only to the extent that they can be remitted in accordance with the terms of existing management agreements and by dividends 
remaining amounts are generally available on an unrestricted basis 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted new minimum capitalization requirements for hmos  health care insurance entities and other risk bearing health care entities

the company intends to fund any increase from available parent company cash reserves  however  there can be no assurance that such cash reserves will be sufficient to fund these minimum capitalization requirements 
the new requirements are expected to be effective on or before december  upon enactment by each state

the company s liquidity needs over the next months will primarily be for the capital items noted above  the company s stock repurchase program  debt service and expansion of the company s operations  including potential acquisitions 
the company believes that existing working capital  operating cash flow and  if necessary  mortgage financing  equipment leasing  and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures and debt service 
additionally  subject to unanticipated cash requirements  the company believes that its existing working capital and operating cash flow and  if necessary  its access to new credit facilities  will enable it to meet its liquidity needs on a longer term basis 
year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company is currently in the process of modifying or replacing its mission critical financial and operational computer systems 
the company is also in the process of testing its non information system technology for year compliance 
the year project has been broken down into five phases inventorying year items  assessing the year items that are determined to be material to the company  renovating or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant  testing and validating material items  and implementing renovated and validated systems 
at december   the inventory and assessment phases are substantially complete as it relates to all material computer systems and approximately complete as it relates to non information system technology 
the company estimates that the replacement renovation phases and the testing validation phases will be complete by october  the company estimates that it is approximately complete with the total project as of december  contingency planning for the mission critical business operations is scheduled to be completed by april these plans focus on business operations involving information systems and non information systems technologies 
the company has initiated formal communications with entities with whom it does business to assess their year issues 
evaluations of the most critical third parties have been initiated  and follow up reviews will be conducted through contingency plans are being developed based on these evaluations and are expected to be completed by the middle of there can be no assurances that the systems of other companies or governmental agencies  such as hcfa and the department of defense dod  on which the company relies will be timely modified for year  or that the failure to modify by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
based upon two separate reports issued by the united states general accounting office it is doubtful that the computer systems at both hcfa and the dod will be fully year compliant by the end of the company does not currently have available data to predict the impact of such non compliance on its business operations 
should there be any material delays caused by year issues  the company anticipates that the governmental entities will make estimated payments 
the company is in the process of implementing three major systems at an estimated cost of million to million  which includes the implementation costs related to the recently acquired kaiser texas operations 
to date the company has spent approximately million on the new computer systems and other year items 
the company is expensing the costs to make modifications to existing computer systems and non computer equipment 
management currently estimates the remaining new computer system costs and other year costs to be million to million for operations in existence prior to the kaiser texas transaction and million to million for the kaiser texas operations that were acquired on october  while this is a substantial effort  it will give the company the benefits of new technology and functionality for many of its financial and operational computer systems and applications 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption of  or a failure of  certain business activities or operations 
such failures could materially adversely affect the company s operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties with which the company does business  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of potential year failures will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that  with the implementation of the new computer systems and completion of the entire project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of operations should be reduced 
the above contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements relating to the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions  and adequate resources  that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year disclosure should be read in conjunction with the following disclosure of the company the costs of the project and the dates on which the company plans to complete the necessary year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the ability of the company s significant suppliers  customers and others with which it conducts business  including federal and state governmental agencies  to identify and resolve their own year issues and similar uncertainties 
inflation health care costs continue to rise at a faster rate than the consumer price index 
the company uses various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on its anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with the company s various health care providers  and other health care cost containment measures 
there can be no assurance  however  that  in the future  the company s ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  competitive pressures  applicable regulations  increases in pharmacy costs  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
government regulation the company s business  offering health care coverage  health care management services  workers compensation programs and  to a lesser extent  the delivery of medical services  is heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels 
government regulation of health care coverage products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change from time to time 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion in promulgating regulations and in interpreting and enforcing laws and regulations 
while the company is unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or the impact on the company of any particular change  the company s operations and financial results could be negatively affected by regulatory revisions 
for example  any proposals affecting underwriting practices  limiting rate increases  requiring new or additional benefits or affecting contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care providers willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the continued consideration and enactment of anti managed care laws and regulations by federal and state bodies may make it more difficult for the company to manage medical costs and may adversely affect financial results 
in addition to changes in applicable laws and regulations  the company is subject to various audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the federal employee retirement income security act  which regulates insured and self insured health coverage plans offered by employers  the federal employees health benefit plan  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and laws relating to utilization management and the delivery of health care 
any such government action could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect the company s reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for the company to sell its products and services
