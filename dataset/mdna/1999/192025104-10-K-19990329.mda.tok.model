the gap technique begins by segmenting interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities into future time periods  typically one year  based on scheduled maturity or repricing date 
repriceable assets are then subtracted from repriceable liabilities to determine a difference  or gap 
the measurement process relies on many assumptions such as the amount and timing of repriceable cash flows from interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the following assumptions are made about repriceable cash flows from interest sensitive assets 
the total portfolio balance of variable rate instruments can reprice daily 
adjustable rate instruments reprice at the interest maturity date  usually annually 
fixed rate loans reprice at their scheduled maturity date and also include estimated prepayments 
fixed rate investment securities  with the exception of mortgage backed securities  reprice at their scheduled maturity date  or call date if more appropriate 
fixed rate mortgage backed securities reprice based on principal pay down estimates provided by bloomberg 
generally  interest sensitive liabilities reprice similarly to interest sensitive assets with the exception of now and savings deposits which do not have scheduled maturities 
technically  now and savings accounts can be repriced at any time 
historically  now and savings balances have been relatively stable in spite of changes in market interest rates 
this stability assumption was made in the current measurement process 
a schedule which depicts balance sheet repricing characteristics and an estimate of gap at december   is provided below 
one way to predict how a change in market interest rates will impact net interest income for specific time frames is through the cumulative gap measure 
for example  the cumulative gap in the repricing category represents a one year net liability position of million or percent of interest earning assets at december  the liability sensitive gap position implies that over the next year there will be a positive impact on net interest income if market rates decline 
the theory is that more liabilities will reprice  at lower market interest rates  than the assets that they fund 
conversely  an increase in market interest rates would have a negative impact on net interest income 
a gap analysis is limited in its usefulness as it represents a one day position  which is continually changing and not necessarily indicative of the codorus valley s position at any other time 
additionally  the gap analysis does not consider the complexity of interest rate relationships and spreads depending on the direction  magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates
