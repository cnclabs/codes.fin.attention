year the year yk issue involves the inability of some computers or microprocessors to correctly handle the century change that will occur at midnight  december  the yk issue  which also includes a number of related problems  affects nearly every business in the world 
the company s assessment of potential yk problems has focused on three areas i the company s information technology it systems  ii its non it systems  and iii its relationships with third parties 
the company has completed an assessment of its it systems exposure to the yk related problems  and currently believes that its main it systems  which include billing  accounting  and payroll systems  are yk compliant 
although the company has not tested the yk compliance of such systems  such systems have been represented as yk compliant by the vendors thereof 
certain less critical it systems as well as certain individual computers and associated software are not currently yk compliant  however  the company expects to replace these systems or make them yk compliant as needed 
the company has also assessed the exposure of its non it systems such as time clocks to yk problems  and does not believe that yk issues related to non it systems will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company has made an assessment of the yk readiness of its payors and other third parties with whom it does business 
the company has contacted all material payors and other third parties in an attempt to minimize the effect of any yk issues that may arise 
despite efforts that the company may make in this regard  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies with whom it does business will be compliant 
to date  the company has incurred no material expenses related to the yk compliance of its it and non it systems 
the company believes that the costs associated with finalizing the yk compliance of such systems will neither materially increase the company s future capital expenditures nor materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company believes that its most likely worst case yk scenario is that some of its material third party payors will not be yk compliant and will have difficulty processing and paying the company s bills  which could affect the company s cash flows 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address this scenario 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   the company had only cash equivalents  invested in high grade  very short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
the company has outstanding loans at both fixed and variable rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on the company s future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the fair values of these instruments 
for loans with variable interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the company s future earnings  cash flows and fair values related to these instruments
