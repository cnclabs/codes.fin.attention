item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business environment the boston beer company is engaged in the business of brewing and selling beer  ale and cider products primarily in the domestic market and  to a lesser extent  in selected international markets 
the alcoholic beverage industry is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels 
the federal treasury department s bureau of alcohol  tobacco  and firearms batf enforces laws under the federal alcohol administration act 
the batf is responsible for enacting excise tax laws which directly affect the company s results of operations 
state and regulatory authorities have the ability to suspend or revoke the company s licenses and permits or impose substantial fines for violations 
the company has established strict guidelines in efforts to ensure compliance with all state and federal laws 
however  the loss or revocation of any existing license or permit could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
boston beer competes in what the company defines as the better beer category  also referred to as the specialty beer category 
the defining factors for better beer includes price  quality  image and taste  and are representative of imports and craft beers 
the company prices its beers at a premium compared to domestic mass produced beers but at a level consistent with other beers in the better beer category 
the company believes that this pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its core brands  while realizing that economic pricing pressures may affect future pricing levels 
prior to the acquisition of the cincinnati brewery  the company operated primarily with the strategy of contract brewing  which utilizes the excess capacity of other breweries 
during  approximately of the company s products were produced by utilizing the excess capacity of non company owned breweries 
this strategy provides the company with flexibility in addition to quality and cost advantages and increased cash flows 
the company follows strict guidelines in selecting the appropriate brewery and monitoring the production process in order to ensure that quality and control standards are attained 
the on going ownership and on going operation of breweries currently owned by the stroh brewing company  where the company produces a significant amount of its beer  are in doubt due to the proposed stroh transactions see further discussion below under potential transaction between stroh brewing company and pabst brewing company 
the company does not believe that its results of operations  cash flows or financial position will be materially affected as a result of the stroh transactions 
the company believes that it will have adequate capacity for the production of its products for at least five years 
the company faces competition from considerably larger companies with more resources  and from many smaller craft brewers that typically operate in locally contained markets 
the better beer category has become increasingly competitive over the past few years due to two primary factors a significant number of new entrants  primarily in locally contained markets and existing companies  primarily imports  competing more aggressively 
as a result  the company has lost share in the better beer segment and its revenue growth rate has become stagnant 
as the market matures and the better beer category continues to consolidate  the company believes that companies that are well positioned in terms of brand equity  marketing and distribution will prosper 
with approximately distributors nationwide and salespeople  a commitment to maintaining brand equity  and the quality of its beer  the company believes it is well positioned to compete in a maturing market 
the demand for the company s products is subject to changes in consumers tastes 
since the company began brewing beer  one trend regarding consumers preferences has been a shift towards more flavorful  higher quality beers  which has increased the demand for better beer products 
the company s product strategy is in line with this trend 
however  certain of its styles appear to be adversely affected by a counter trend toward more mainstream lighter styles 
a change in consumer tastes or in the demand for better beer products may affect the company s future results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
the company cannot predict whether the trend towards full bodied  more flavorful beers will continue 
brewery acquisition effective march   the company acquired all of the equipment and other brewery related personal property of an independent brewing company located in cincinnati  ohio 
the company believes that owning a brewery will complement the contract brewery arrangements currently in place by providing greater flexibility for brewing production and adding to the company s existing brewing capacity 
the cincinnati brewery is currently managed by the samuel adams brewery company  ltd  a wholly owned affiliate of the company 
the results of operations of the cincinnati brewery  since the date of acquisition  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations please refer to pages and for quarterly financial results of the company 
for purposes of this discussion  boston beer s core brands include all products sold under the samuel adams r  oregon original tm or hardcore r trademarks 
core brands do not include the products brewed at the cincinnati brewery under contract arrangements for third parties 
volume produced under contract arrangements is referred to below as non core products 
boston beer s flagship brand is samuel adams boston lager boston lager 
the following table sets forth certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales years ended barrels sold in s    percentage of net sales sales less excise taxes net sales cost of sales gross profit advertising  promotional  and selling expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating income other expense income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
volume 
volume decreased by  barrels  of which  barrels was due to a decline in the production of non core products 
total volume relating to non core products was  barrels for the year ended december  as compared to  barrels for the year ended december  management anticipates a continued decline in volume relating to non core products 
volume for boston beer s core brands declined by  barrels to  barrels for the year ended december  this decline was due to continued sales declines of the oregon original tm brands and other year round beer styles  offset by an increase in the sale of boston lager and ciders 
sales for seasonal brands were flat during as compared to the decline in oregon original brands is partially due to the discontinuance of certain styles during and the single digit growth in boston lager shipments is encouraging as this is the flagship brand and represents over of total shipments 
the decline in the year round styles is indicative of the market continuing to mature as consumers become less inclined to experiment with new styles 
selling price 
the selling price per barrel increased by  or to per barrel for the year ended december  this is partially due to a decline in sales of non core products 
revenue contributed from non core products is significantly lower per barrel than revenue contributed from core brands 
the decline of shipments of non core products improved average net sales by per barrel  or 
the remaining increase in net selling price per barrel is due to normal price increases and to a lesser extent  changes in the packaging mix 
significant changes in the packaging mix would have a material effect on sales 
the company packages its core brands in bottles and kegs 
assuming the same level of production  a shift in the mix from kegs to bottles would effectively increase revenue per barrel  as the price per equivalent barrel is greater for bottles than for kegs 
the ratio of kegs to bottles declined only slightly in core brands to of total shipments relating to kegs during from in the prior year and therefore did not have a significant effect on revenue per barrel during gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales decreased to as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this is primarily due to a decline in barrels shipped related to non core products  improvements in the production process at the cincinnati brewery  and lower costs of certain raw materials 
increases in hop inventory related expenses and depreciation expense partially offset these declines 
the gross profit margin on non core products is significantly lower than for core brands 
therefore  the decline in the non core product volume increased gross profit per barrel for the company as a whole 
the decline in volume relating to non core products resulted in an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales of approximately 
the company anticipates a continued decline in volume relating to non core products 
the company recognized an expense of million during in order to accrue for anticipated losses from existing hops purchase commitments 
additionally  the company incurred expenditures of million during relating to the cancellation of certain hops contracts 
see hops purchase commitments below for further discussion 
depreciation expense increased by  or  during as compared to this increase results from the depreciation of several capital assets acquired during relating to keg purchases and modifications to kegging and bottling lines at various breweries 
in accordance with the company s depreciation policy  one half of a year s worth of depreciation is recognized during the year of acquisition 
additional factors which may affect gross profit include changes in the packaging and product mix 
the company packages its core brands in bottles and kegs 
while gross profit as a percentage of net sales is higher for kegs than for bottles  the per equivalent barrel gross profit is higher for bottles than for kegs  in absolute terms 
therefore  an increase in kegs as a percentage of physical volume while increasing the overall gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales  will deliver fewer absolute gross profit dollars with which to run the business 
in keg sales as a percentage of total equivalent barrels of core brands declined to from in however  the gross profit per equivalent barrel increased in absolute dollars for both kegs and bottles due to revenue increases and cost decreases for both types of packages 
the net result of the packaging mix shift and the per unit profit improvement was an increase in gross profit per equivalent barrel in both absolute and percentage terms in the core business 
gross profit was not significantly affected during due to a change in product mix from the previous year 
seasonal and year round beers can be more expensive to produce and the additional expenses may not be offset by increased pricing 
gross profit is not significantly affected by changes in brewing locations 
the company attempts to minimize total costs  including freight  by shifting production between plants 
during  the company shifted production in order to maximize utilization in the cincinnati brewery  while ensuring cost efficient production 
during  production may shift between plants as a result of the pending stroh transactions see discussion below under potential transaction between stroh brewing company and pabst brewing company 
the company does not anticipate a material impact on gross profit as a result of the stroh transactions 
advertising  promotional  and selling 
advertising  promotional  and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decline in total salaries  other employee related expenditures  local marketing and point of sale expenditures  which were partially offset by an increase in advertising expenditures 
the decline in salaries  other employee related expenditures and local marketing expenditures is primarily due to a decline in sales personnel headcount of approximately from the previous year 
the company reorganized the sales division during the first quarter of in efforts to achieve improved efficiencies 
the company remains committed to maintaining a strong and efficient sales force 
in addition  improved policies and controls relating to sales related expenditures contributed to the decline 
point of sale expenditures declined primarily due to increased utilization of internally developed promotional and marketing campaigns 
this has served to increase the quality and efficiency of brand development activities 
in fiscal year  the company increased its advertising expenditures by approximately over expenditures in the prior year 
boston beer launched a national television advertising campaign during the third quarter of  the results of which are not yet clear 
the company anticipates launching another television campaign during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or as compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to a change in bad debt expense from a recovery of  during fiscal year to an expense of  during fiscal year the cash collections process was significantly improved during which resulted in the recovery of previously written off amounts 
net of this factor  general and administrative expenses were flat as compared to the prior year 
interest income 
interest income increased by  due to an increase in average cash and short term investments from approximately million during to million during other expense  net 
other expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million loss realized on the sale of a marketable security in fiscal year income taxes 
the effective income tax rate increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the million loss realized on the sale of a marketable equity security during  as the company does not expect to fully realize the tax benefit associated with such loss 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
volume increased by to million barrels in fiscal year from million barrels in fiscal year this increase in  was due to the inclusion of  barrels of non core products 
the company s core brands sold fewer barrels in than in  however  sales of samuel adams boston lager r and seasonal brands  which make up of the company s core brand sales  continued to increase 
despite this  net sales decreased by to million in from million in core brand sales decreased to million in  as sales of non core products are at prices much lower than those of the company s core brands 
net sales price per barrel decreased due primarily to sales of non core products 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of sales decreased per barrel to of net sales in from of net sales in this decrease was due principally to the following a decrease in raw material costs  reduced packaging costs due to a shift in the core brands package mix towards kegs  resulting in decreased packaging material costs  lower packaging obsolescence expense and lower freight and warehousing costs  offset by an increase in depreciation principally on kegs the cincinnati brewery assets and a reduction of savings from re used glass 
advertising  promotional  and selling 
advertising  promotional  and selling expenses decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the per barrel expense decreased by to in from in primarily as a result of the additional non promoted barrels from the cincinnati brewery core brand expenses were per barrel in 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising  promotional  and selling expenses increased to in from in the decrease in expenditures reflected a change in marketing mix with increased emphasis on selling expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this net decrease was primarily caused by a million reduction in bad debt expense 
this was partially offset by the inclusion of general and administrative expense of the cincinnati brewery  as well as increases in personnel  salaries and related employee benefits 
operating income 
operating income decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to the inclusion of the cincinnati brewery which recorded a loss in this loss was partially offset by the savings in general and administrative expense and advertising  promotional and selling expenses as discussed above 
other income  net 
other income  net  decreased by to  in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease of million is primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to borrowings against the revolving line of credit and the company s long term note and a charge for the repurchase of an overseas distribution right in western europe 
net income 
net income decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease is due to a reduction in operating income of  and other income of million  as discussed above  and is offset by a reduction in income tax expense of in to million from million in liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition continued to be strong during cash and short term investments increased to million for the year ended december  from million as of december  the company s primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities  which was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the cash provided by operating activities during represents net income of million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  a loss on the sale of a marketable equity security of million  and changes in assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in assets and liabilities are due to a decline in accounts receivable of million resulting primarily from improved procedures in cash collections and various timing differences 
contract commitment fees paid and received substantially offset one another during cash used for capital expenditures declined to million during as compared to million during in addition  the company used million of cash in for the acquisition of certain assets of the cincinnati brewery 
factors that contributed to the decline primarily include a decrease in capital expenditures relating primarily to kegs  production line modifications and leasehold improvements to the company s corporate office 
the company initiated a conversion from hoff stevens kegs to sankey kegs during the company spent  in purchasing sankey kegs during as compared to million during during and the company incurred million and million  respectively  in leasehold improvements and production line modifications at various brewery locations 
the decline primarily relates to decreased expenditures incurred at the cincinnati brewery 
during  the company significantly expanded its corporate office space located in boston  massachusetts 
capital expenditures incurred during relating to the expansion totaled approximately million 
the company invested million of net positive cash flow in government securities during as compared to million during the company has historically invested its excess cash in money market funds  short term treasury and agency bills  and more recently  high grade commercial paper 
during  the company purchased a marketable equity security at a cost of million 
this security was sold during the second quarter of at a loss of million 
during fiscal year  net cash provided by financing activities was million  resulting from net borrowings of million and  of proceeds received from stock option exercises  offset by million of payments on long term debt 
this compares to  of cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year on march   the existing million line of credit expires and the balance outstanding under the million line of credit converts to a term note 
as of december   million was outstanding under the million line of credit 
principal payments on the term note are payable either in twenty quarterly installments or upon expiration of the line 
the company currently expects to repay the outstanding balance on the line of credit during effective october   the board authorized management to implement a stock repurchase  subject to an aggregate expenditure limitation of million 
there were no stock repurchases under this program as of december  with working capital of million at december   resources should be sufficient to meet the company s short term and long term operating  capital and debt service requirements 
the potential impact of known facts  commitments  events and uncertainties year as has been widely publicized  many computer systems and microprocessors are not programmed to accommodate dates beyond the year the company s exposure to this year yk problem comes not only from its own internal computer systems and microprocessors  but also from the systems and microprocessors of its key vendors  including by way of illustration its contract breweries  raw material suppliers  utility companies  payroll services and banks  and its distributors and other customers 
a failure of any of these internal or external systems could adversely affect the company s ability to brew  package  sell  ship and bill for products and to collect on invoices and account for collections 
in effect  any significant computer failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
with this in mind  the company commenced a comprehensive review of potential yk issues  both with respect to the company s internal systems and those of third parties with which it has significant relationships 
the company currently believes that all of its internal systems will be year compliant by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year  with the exception of the depletions tracking system which is expected to be compliant by the end of the second quarter 
this belief is based on its own internal evaluations and testing and on assurances from its systems vendors 
current estimates are that the total cost to achieve internal year compliance  other than at the cincinnati brewery  will not exceed  exclusive of amounts to be expended on contingency plans 
approximately  of this amount was spent on an e mail system migration during the fourth quarter of fiscal year this  anticipated upgrade cost is in addition to other planned information technology it projects 
while the intensive effort expected to achieve yk compliance has caused and may continue to cause delays in other it projects  the company does not expect that any of these delays will have a significant effect on the company s business or that any of the company s other it projects will be canceled or postponed to pay for the yk upgrades 
the company evaluated all of its microprocessors and control systems at the cincinnati brewery in light of the yk problem 
as part of this process  the company has conducted an inventory of the brewery s automated machinery and other computerized equipment and has contacted applicable vendors for information regarding yk compliance 
the company has upgraded or modified the brewery s microprocessors and control systems  to the extent necessary 
the company is currently developing applicable contingency plans 
testing of all brewery systems has been completed 
preliminary estimates of the cost to bring all brewery systems into yk compliance at the cincinnati brewery do not exceed  the company continues to evaluate and test all brewery equipment 
process controls at the brewery are integral to the brewery s operations 
a failure of any of these controls could adversely affect the company s ability to continue brewing operations  however  because many of the brewing processes can be controlled manually  the actual risk that the company will be unable to brew is low 
in addition  the company currently plans to shut the brewery down for the first several days of january for testing purposes and will be able to operate much of the brewery equipment manually  if necessary 
the company relies extensively on its suppliers and contract breweries 
because their systems are not directly under the company s control  the company is at risk that all required external yk compliance efforts will not be completed on time and significant business disruptions will result 
the company has formed a committee to assure that all vendor and other relationship yk issues are analyzed and addressed 
under the direction of this committee  the company compiled a list of all of its vendors and  as to each vendor  assessed the impact that a yk failure would likely have on the company s business and operations 
the company then sent a yk questionnaire to each vendor believed to present a possible critical risk  in order to ascertain the yk compliance status of each 
the company is currently in the process of compiling and analyzing the information submitted by these vendors 
to date  questionnaires have been sent to critical vendors 
all critical vendors have responded and all have asserted that they are addressing the yk problem or are already in compliance 
the company intends to continue to identify potential critical vendors and to monitor the progress toward compliance of those not yet compliant 
the company has also issued questionnaires to non critical vendors and is conducting the same analysis with them 
in addition to obtaining and assessing information concerning vendor yk status  the company is requiring all new vendors and all existing vendors entering into new contracts with the company to warrant yk compliance 
management understands the potentially serious consequences of a system failure and also understands that not all vendors may be yk compliant prior to january  for this reason  the company is developing contingency plans for all critical services and supplies 
as part of this contingency planning  the company is assessing the cost of vendor shutdown  understanding that  because of the complex nature of the company s supply chain and the lack of clarity as to the effect of multiple vendor failure  any assessment process is imprecise 
the company believes that the most significant threats to its ability to operate are presented by possible disruptions of brewing operations at its contract breweries  and its supply of glass and malt 
because the company brews its products at multiple facilities  management believes that it has significant operating risk only if more than one of these facilities is unable to produce 
in addition  management expects that  as is the case with the cincinnati brewery  in the event of a system failure at a contract brewery  the brewery would be able to recommence operations fairly rapidly  but on an inefficient  manual basis 
a systems failure at the company s glass supplier could significantly affect the company s ability to package and ship products 
the company s current supplier is one of the world s largest and the company believes that finding alternate sources of supply would be problematic 
because of the nature of this risk  the company has worked closely with its supplier on this issue and has received assurances that yk compliance will be achieved on time 
a similar situation exists with respect to malt 
if the company s supply of malt were interrupted  the company s ability to meet production schedules could be affected  although alternate sources of supply might be available  albeit at a higher cost 
the company also believes that its current vendors could run the malting process manually and that  accordingly  the risk of a significant disruption is slight 
in the unlikely event that the company is unable to produce or ship any product the worst case scenario  the company estimates its financial exposure to be in the range of million per week of lost net revenue  over the short term 
using forward planning ratios  this lost revenue translates into lost variable gross profit  in the absence of mitigating cost cutting  of million per week 
a production disruption for an extended period is likely to affect the availability of the company s products to consumers  leading to a decline in brand equity  the financial consequences of which are not susceptible to estimation 
the company does not expect to encounter the worst case scenario 
the financial consequences of a less significant disruption are difficult to predict  as they will depend on the exact circumstances and duration of the disruption 
it is possible that the conclusions reached by the company from its analysis to date will change  with the result that the cost estimates and target completion dates outlined above will change 
the company will continue to explore contingency plans  so as to be in a position to mitigate the consequences of any disruption resulting from the yk issue 
potential transaction between stroh brewing company and pabst brewing company on february   stroh brewing company stroh announced that it had reached definitive agreements to sell a majority of its beer brands and the allentown brewery to pabst brewing company pabst and certain of its brands to miller brewing company miller collectively  the stroh transactions 
it is anticipated that the stroh transactions will be completed during the second quarter of  however  they are subject to review by the united states department of justice and the company has been advised by stroh that it cannot be sure that the stroh transactions will be completed 
the company brews approximately of its production at the stroh breweries 
pabst has agreed to assume stroh s obligations under the stroh contract in the event that the proposed stroh transactions are completed  and miller has agreed to guarantee pabst s contract brewing commitment 
the company s volume brewed at the allentown brewery is anticipated to remain substantially unchanged as a result of the stroh transactions 
stroh has indicated that it will continue to operate its remaining five breweries  including the portland brewery after completion of the stroh transactions  until production can be transferred to a pabst or miller owned brewery 
it is anticipated that the company s production will be transferred from the portland brewery to a pabst or miller owned brewery during the fiscal year 
the company has completed  to its satisfaction  detailed inspections of the potential breweries that are likely to assume the volume that is currently brewed at the portland brewery 
the company does not anticipate any significant problems during the transition period or thereafter  as a result of the stroh transactions  and does not believe that it will have material effect on its results of operations  statement of financial position or statement of cash flows during however  the exact timing and completion of the stroh transactions are dependent on many external factors  and the company cannot be certain that the stroh transactions will occur  or proceed as the company expects 
in the event that the stroh transactions do not occur and the production capacities at the stroh breweries becomes unavailable to the company  the company believes that it would have access to sufficient brewery options to produce the volume that is currently brewed at the stroh breweries 
however  a shift in production between plants may result in incremental costs  primarily freight 
hops purchase commitments the company enters into purchase commitments for hops based upon forecasted future requirements  among other factors 
in recent years the company s rate of sales growth has declined and was negative during and  resulting in an increase in hops inventory 
as a result  existing purchase commitments may exceed projected future needs over the life of such commitments 
the company recorded a provision of million in to reserve for excess purchase commitments 
in addition  in the company recorded a million charge associated with the cancellation of purchase commitment contracts 
there were no reserves for hops contract losses required  or contract cancellation costs incurred  in or the computation of the excess purchase commitment reserve requires management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  cancellation costs and supply  among others 
actual results may materially differ from management s estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement requires that all derivative financial instruments be reflected on the balance sheet at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized periodically in earnings or as a component of equity  depending on the nature of the underlying instrument being hedged 
in the event that an entity does not effectively hedge against the underlying derivative  changes in the fair market value of the underlying derivative will be recognized currently in the income statement 
the company typically enters into commitments to purchase hops that extend six years with various hop growers 
these purchase contracts  which extend through crop  are denominated in the foreign currency  respective to the location where the hops are grown 
additionally  the company enters into commitments to purchase apple juices which typically extend less than one year and are denominated in a foreign currency 
in the event that the company does not effectively hedge against fluctuations in the respective foreign currency  the impact of the currency fluctuation on the purchase price will be recognized in the income statement 
currently  it is the company s policy not to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
sfas is required to be adopted no later than the beginning of fiscal year management is currently evaluating the effects that this statement is expected to have on the company s financial statements 
other risks and uncertainties changes in general economic conditions could result in numerous events that may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
numerous factors that could adversely affect the company s operating income  cash flows and financial position  include but are not limited to a slowing of the growth rate of the better beer category  share of market erosion of boston lager and seasonal beers due to increased competition  more rapid decline than experienced recently in oregon original tm beers and other samuel adams r year round styles an unexpected decline in the brewing capacity available to the company  increased advertising and promotional expenditures that are not followed by higher sales volume  higher than planned costs of operating the cincinnati brewery  adverse fluctuations in raw material or packaging costs which cannot be passed along through increased prices  world hop market conditions affecting the company s ability to buy or sell hops or cancel existing excess hop commitments  poor weather conditions  resulting in an inadequate supply of raw materials that are agriculturally grown  adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in control or ownership of the current distribution network which leads to less support of the company s products  increases in the costs of distribution  and slower than planned market acceptance of hardcore r cider 
the company continues to brew its samuel adams boston lager r at each of its brewing sites but does not brew all of its other products at each site  except for the boston brewery 
therefore  at any particular time  the company may be relying on only one supplier for its products other than samuel adams boston lager r 
the company believes that it has sufficient capacity options that would allow for a shift in production locations if necessary 
in the event of a labor dispute  governmental action or other events that would prevent either the cincinnati brewery or any of the contract breweries from producing the company s beer  management believes that it would be able to shift production between breweries so as to meet demand for its beer 
in such event  however  the company may experience temporary shortfalls in production and or increased production or distribution costs  the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
historically  the company has not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its suppliers 
although the company believes that there are alternate sources available for the ingredients and packaging materials  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to acquire such ingredients or packaging materials from substitute sources on a timely or cost effective basis in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders 
the loss of a supplier could  in the short term  adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
hops and malt are agricultural products and therefore many outside factors  including weather conditions  crop production  government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture  could effect both price and supply 
as previously discussed  miller introduced a new contract with its distributors that seeks to impose new requirements on distributors so as to focus the distributor s attention  time  selling effort and investment on miller products 
these new contracts may affect the way distributors allocate selling effort and investment to the brands that they distribute and may adversely affect the distributors support of the company s brands 
the company is uncertain of the effect this may have on its results of operations  cash flows and financial position as miller distributors represent a significant part of the company s distribution network

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other market risk sensitive instruments for the purpose of speculation or for trading purposes 
market risk sensitive instruments include derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
such instruments that are exposed to rate or price changes should be included in the sensitivity analysis disclosure 
the only purchased ingredient or material which the company would consider a commodity for the purpose of measuring market risk is two row malt  which is made from two row barley 
the company has entered into a contract which guarantees a fixed price for the purchase of two row malt based upon need and therefore is not at risk to potential short term market fluctuations 
the company does not enter into derivative commodity instruments ie futures  forwards  swaps  options  etc the company enters into hops purchase contracts in foreign denominated currencies  as described above under hops purchase commitments 
the purchase price changes as foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
during and  the company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of such foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding under a million line of credit 
on march   the line of credit expires and the balance outstanding is payable either upon expiration of the line or in twenty quarterly installments 
in the latter case  interest will accrue at the prime rate or the applicable adjusted libor plus  after march  for financial statement purposes  the value of our debt approximates fair value as interest rates are variable 
sensitivity analysis the company applies a sensitivity analysis to reflect the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency rates and interest rates 
the estimated potential one day loss in fair value of the company s debt and the estimated potential loss in pretax earnings from a potential one day adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates as of december  is as follows earnings fair value impact impact in thousands instruments sensitive to foreign currency rates  interest rates it should be noted that the potential earnings impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to contracts that extend six years 
therefore  the above reflects the maximum potential pretax earnings impact over a six year period  under current accounting principles 
there are many economic factors that can affect volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
as such factors cannot be predicted  the actual impact on earnings and fair value due to an adverse change in the respective rates and prices could vary substantially from the amounts calculated above
