the dominant investment held is fixed maturity securities  which represent approximately of the investment portfolio 
fixed maturity performance in  the lnc fixed maturity portfolio produced a return of  compared to the lehman brothers government corporate index government bonds  corporate bonds which produced 
the underperformance relative to the index during is due to the investment strategy of investing in bonds with sufficient spread to support long term insurance liabilities

century compliance the year issue is pervasive and complex and affects virtually every aspect of lnc s businesses 
lnc s computer systems and interfaces with the computer systems of vendors  suppliers  customers and business partners are particularly vulnerable 
lnc and its operating subsidiaries have been redirecting a large portion of internal information technology it efforts and contracting with outside consultants to update systems to address year issues 
experts have been engaged to assist in developing work plans and cost estimates and to complete remediation activities 
for the year ended december   lnc identified expenditures of million million after tax to address this issue 
this brings the expenditures for to million million after tax 
lnc s financial plans for include expected expenditures of an additional million million after tax bringing estimated overall year expenditures to million million after tax 
because updating systems and procedures is an integral part of lnc s on going operations  approximately of expenditures shown above are expected to continue after all year issues have been resolved 
actual year expenditures through december  and future year expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
the anticipated cost of addressing year issues is based on management s current best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
such costs will be monitored closely by management 
nevertheless  there can be no guarantee that actual costs will not be higher than these estimated costs 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer problems and other uncertainties 
the current scope of the overall year program includes the following four major project areas addressing the readiness of business applications  operating systems and hardware on mainframe  personal computer and local area network platforms it  addressing the readiness of non it embedded software and equipment non it  addressing the readiness of key business partners and establishing year contingency plans 
the projects to address it and non it readiness have four major phases 
phase one involves raising awareness and creating an inventory of all it and non it assets 
the second phase consists of assessing all items inventoried to initially determine whether they are affected by the year issue and preparing general plans and strategies 
the third phase entails the detailed planning and remediation of affected systems and equipment 
the last phase consists of testing to verify year readiness 
lnc has completed these four phases for over two thirds of its high priority it systems  including those provided by software vendors 
while lnc s year program for nearly all high priority it systems is expected to be completed in the first quarter of  phase four  for a small but important subset of these systems  will continue through the end of the second quarter as of december  the status of projects addressing readiness of it assets is of it assets have been inventoried phase and assessed phase  of it projects have been through the remediation phase phase with the last project scheduled for completion by the end of march  and of it projects have completed the testing phase phase with the last project scheduled to finish testing by the end of june a portion of the effort that extends into is dependent on outside third parties and is behind the original schedule 
lnc is working with these parties to modify the completion schedule 
as of december  the status of projects that address readiness of high priority non it assets  is of non it assets have been inventoried phase and assessed phase  of non it projects addressing remediation phase have been completed and of non it projects have completed the testing phase phase 
lnc expects to have all phases related to high priority non it completed by the end of october concurrent with the it and non it projects  the readiness of key business partners is being reviewed and year contingency plans are being developed 
the most significant categories of key business partners are financial institutions  software vendors  and utility providers gas  electric and telecommunications 
surveys have been mailed to these key business partners 
based on responses received  current levels of readiness are being assessed  follow up contacts are underway  alternative strategies are being developed and testing is being scheduled where feasible 
this effort is expected to continue well into as noted above  software vendor assessments are considered part of the it projects and  therefore  would follow the schedule shown above for such projects 
while lnc is working to meet the schedules outlined above  some uncertainty remains 
specific factors that give rise to this uncertainty include a possible loss of technical resources to perform the work  failure to identify all susceptible systems  non compliance by third parties whose systems and operations impact lnc and other similar uncertainties 
a worst case scenario might include lnc s inability to achieve year readiness with respect to one or more of lnc s significant policyholder systems  resulting in a material disruption to lnc s operations 
specifically  lnc could experience an interruption in its ability to collect and process premiums or deposits  process claim payments  accurately maintain policyholder information  accurately maintain accounting records  and or perform adequate customer service 
should the worst case scenario occur  it could  depending on its duration  have a material impact on lnc s results of operations and financial position 
simple failures can be repaired and returned to production within a matter of hours with no material impact 
unanticipated failures with a longer service disruption period would have a more serious impact 
for this reason  lnc is placing significant emphasis on risk management and year contingency planning 
lnc is in the process of modifying its contingency plans to address potential year issues 
where these efforts identify high risks due either to unacceptable work around procedures or significant readiness risks  appropriate risk management techniques are being defined 
these techniques  such as resource shifting or use of alternate providers  will be employed to provide stronger assurances of readiness 
lnc has gone through exercises to identify worst case scenario failures 
at this time  lnc believes its plans are sufficient to mitigate identified worst case scenarios 
review of consolidated financial condition some of the increases in the balance sheet accounts described below are a result of the purchase of two blocks of individual life insurance and annuity business in january and october of see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
investments the investment portfolio  excluding cash and invested cash  is comprised of fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage loans on real estate  real estate  either wholly owned or joint ventures  and other long term investments 
lnc purchases investments for its segmented portfolios with yield  duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported 
the total investment portfolio increased billion in this increase was the net result of increases from the addition of billion in invested assets related to the two blocks of business acquired in  the increase in fair value of securities available for sale and the new purchases of investments from cash flow generated by the business units being partially offset by the continuation of fixed annuity contractholders opting to transfer funds to variable annuity contracts 
lnc maintains a high quality fixed maturity securities portfolio 
as of december   billion or of its fixed maturity securities portfolio had ratings of aa or better 
fixed maturity securities with below investment grade ratings bb or less were billion or of the total fixed maturity securities portfolio see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the below investment grade fixed maturity securities represent of lnc s total investment portfolio 
the interest rates available on these below investment grade securities are significantly higher than are available on other corporate debt securities 
also  the risk of loss due to default by the borrower is significantly greater with respect to such below investment grade securities because these securities are generally unsecured  often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer and issued by companies that usually have high levels of indebtedness 
lnc attempts to minimize the risks associated with these below investment grade securities by limiting the exposure to any one issuer and by closely monitoring the credit worthiness of such issuers 
for the year ended december   the aggregate cost of below investment grade securities purchased was billion 
aggregate proceeds from such investments sold were billion  resulting in a realized pre tax loss at the time of sale of million 
lnc s entire fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio is classified as available for sale and is carried at fair value 
changes in fair values  net of related deferred acquisition costs  amounts required to satisfy policyholder commitments and taxes are charged or credited directly to shareholders equity 
note to the consolidated financial statements on page shows the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december  lnc s fixed maturity securities available for sale include mortgage backed securities 
the mortgage backed securities included in lnc s investment portfolio are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments 
this may result in these securities having a different actual cash flow and maturity than planned at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss 
those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain 
in addition  lnc may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities 
prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact 
lnc may incur disinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and lnc is forced to sell the securities 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
lnc limits the extent of its risk on mortgage backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class  by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par  by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral  and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield but higher liquidity than higher risk mortgage backed securities 
at selected times  higher risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio 
at december   lnc did not have a significant amount of higher risk mortgage backed securities 
there are negligible default risks in the mortgage backed securities portfolio as a whole as the vast majority of the assets are either guaranteed by us government sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status 
note to the consolidated financial statements on page shows additional detail about the underlying collateral 
as of december   mortgage loans on real estate and investments in real estate represented and of the total investment portfolio 
as of december   the underlying properties supporting the mortgage loans on real estate consisted of in commercial office buildings  in retail stores  in apartments  in industrial buildings  in hotels motels and in other 
in addition to the dispersion by type of property  the mortgage loan portfolio is geographically diversified throughout the united states 
cash and invested cash cash and invested cash decreased by billion in this decrease is the result of paying out the funds that had been accumulated at the end of in anticipation of the purchase of a block of individual life and annuity business on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements on page deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs increased million in this increase was the net result of an increase related to the growth in business being partially offset by reductions related to the increase in unrealized gain on securities available for sale 
premiums and fees receivable premiums and fees receivable increased million in as the result of increased volumes of business in the life insurance annuities and reinsurance segments 
assets held in separate accounts this asset account  as well as the corresponding liability account  increased by billion in as a result of increases in annuity and pension funds under management 
this increase resulted from new deposits  market appreciation and the continuation of fixed annuity contractholders opting to transfer funds to variable annuity contracts 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers the increase of million in amounts recoverable from reinsurers was the result of an increased volume of business ceded in the life insurance and annuities segment 
goodwill and other intangible assets the increase of billion and billion  respectively  is the net result of additions related to business acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements on page being more than the on going amortization 
other assets the decrease in other assets of million is the result of having a lower receivable related to investment securities sold in the last few days of versus the end of total liabilities total liabilities increased by billion in the primary item underlying this increase is the addition of the blocks of individual life and annuity business described above 
insurance policy reserves increased billion as a result of the new blocks of business and increased levels of business in the life insurance and annuities segment 
contractholder funds increased million which is the net result of additions related to the block of business acquired and new deposits being partially offset by the withdrawal upon maturity of guaranteed interest contracts 
liabilities related to separate accounts increased billion see discussion of assets held in separate accounts above 
total debt increased million as the result of issuing new debt in the first and third quarters of see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the decrease in the remaining liabilities of is the net amount from an increase in the expected payouts for securities purchased in the last few days of versus a lower volume of such transactions late in being more than offset by the federal income tax decrease 
while it is management s judgement that  based on available information  the appropriate level of liabilities have been recorded  lnc has areas where changes in estimates of related liabilities required could occur in the near term 
these areas include claims for disability income coverages  liabilities and recoveries related to inappropriate selling of products in the united kingdom  liabilities for personal accident programs  liabilities for marketing and compliance issues and the reserve for the run off of group pension annuities see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million during the year ended december  excluding the increase of million related to an increase in the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale  shareholders equity increased million 
this increase in shareholders equity was the net result of increases due to million of net income  million from the issuance of common stock related to benefit plans and million related to an increase in the accumulated foreign exchange gain being offset by million related to the declaration of dividends to shareholders  million of issuance costs related to an offering of feline prides and million for the retirement of common stock 
capital adequacy is a primary measure used by insurance regulators to determine the financial stability of an insurance company 
in the us  risk based capital guidelines are used by the national association of insurance commissioners to determine the amount of capital that represents minimum acceptable operating amounts related to insurance and investment risks 
regulatory action is triggered when an insurer s statutory basis capital falls below the formula produced capital level 
at december   statutory basis capital for each of lnc s us insurance subsidiaries was substantially in excess of regulatory action levels of risk based capital required by the jurisdiction of domicile 
as noted above  shareholders equity includes net unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale 
at december   the book value of per share included of unrealized gains on securities and at december   the book value of per share included of unrealized gains on securities 
a significant portion of both realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments that support long term life insurance  pension and annuity contracts are expected to be applied to contract benefits 
these realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in net income and shareholders equity  respectively 
current accounting standards do not require or permit adjustment of policyholder reserves to recognize the full effect of these realized and unrealized gains or losses on future benefit payments in the absence of a contractual obligation requiring their attribution to policyholders 
liquidity and cash flow liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety 
because of the interval of time from receipt of a deposit or premium until payment of benefits or claims  lnc and other insurers employ investment portfolios as an integral element of operations 
by segmenting its investment portfolios along product lines  lnc enhances the focus and discipline it can apply to managing the liquidity as well as the interest rate and credit risk of each portfolio commensurate with the profile of the liabilities 
for example  portfolios backing products with less certain cash flows and or withdrawal provisions are kept more liquid than portfolios backing products with more predictable cash flows 
the consolidated statements of cash flows on page indicate that operating activities provided cash of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
this statement also classifies the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities and financing activities and discloses the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet lnc s obligations 
although lnc generates adequate cash flow to meet the needs of its normal operations  periodically lnc may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal expansion  acquisitions  investment opportunities and the retirement of lnc s debt and equity 
in april  lnc filed a shelf registration for billion which included the right to offer regular debt  preferred stock  common stock or various forms of hybrid securities 
this billion filing included an aggregate of million that had not been utilized from a previously filed shelf registration 
in december  lnc combined the unused portion of another previously filed shelf registration 
the combination of these two filings  less securities offered in see below  resulted in an unused balance as of december  of million that would allow lnc to issue various securities 
the hybrid securities offerings utilize six subsidiaries lincoln national capital i  ii  iii  iv  v and vi which were formed for the specific purpose of issuing such securities 
all of these subsidiaries common securities are owned by lnc 
cash funds are also available from lnc s revolving credit agreement  which provides for borrowing up to million see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
in  lnc issued million of long term debt  million of series c trust originated preferred securities and million of feline prides 
also lnc purchased and retired    and  shares of common stock at a cost of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the  shares purchased in includes  shares at a cost of million that have been purchased since the june board authorization to repurchase up to million of common stock 
this leaves a board authorization to repurchase an additional million of lnc s common stock as of december  also lnc issued  shares of lnc common stock in to purchase subsidiary companies 
another transaction that occurred in that had a major impact on lnc s cash flow was the sale of a subsidiary for billion see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
lnc used these proceeds to repurchase million of its own common stock  retire million in long term debt  fund the purchase of a interest in seguros serfin lincoln for million  pay the million of taxes related to the gain on sale of discontinued operations and purchase a block of individual life insurance and annuity business for billion see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the remaining balance was initially applied to pay off a portion of lnc s short term debt and invested for general corporate purposes  then later used to fund a portion of the purchase of another block of individual life insurance business 
in order to maximize the use of available cash  the holding company lincoln national corporation maintains a facility where subsidiaries can borrow from the holding company to meet their short term needs and can invest their short term funds with the holding company 
depending on the overall cash availability or need  the holding company invests excess cash in short term investments or borrows funds in the financial markets 
in addition to facilitating the management of cash  the holding company receives dividends from its subsidiaries  invests in operating companies  maintains an investment portfolio and pays shareholder dividends and certain corporate expenses 
holding company cash flow year ended december in millions dividends from subsidiaries lincoln life american states subsidiary subsequently transferred to discontinued operations other net investment income operating expenses interest net sales purchases of investments increase decrease in cash collateral on loaned securities decrease increase in investment in subsidiaries sale of subsidiary discontinued operations investment in sale of unconsolidated affiliates net increase decrease in debt decrease increase in receivables from subsidiaries increase in loans from subsidiaries decrease increase in loans to subsidiaries  federal income taxes paid net tax receipts from subsidiaries dividends paid to shareholders common stock issued for benefit plans retirement of common stock other the table above shows the cash flow activity for the holding company from through the line  net tax receipts from payments to subsidiaries  recognizes that the holding company receives tax payments from subsidiaries  pays the consolidated tax liability and reimburses subsidiaries for the tax effect of any taxable operating and capital losses 
lnc s insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company 
generally  these restrictions pose no short term liquidity concerns for the holding company 
however  as discussed in detail within note on page  the acquisition of two blocks of business in will place further restrictions on the ability of lnc s primary insurance subsidiary  lincoln national life insurance company lincoln life  to declare and pay dividends 
as a result of these acquisitions  lincoln life s statutory earned surplus will be negative and it will be necessary for lincoln life to obtain the prior approval of the indiana insurance commissioner before paying any dividends to lnc until such time its statutory earned surplus is positive 
it is expected that statutory earned surplus will return to a positive position within two to three years from the closing of the aetna transaction assuming a level of statutory earnings coinciding with recent earnings patterns 
if statutory earnings are less than recent patterns due  for example  to adverse operating conditions or further indemnity reinsurance transactions of this nature  the statutory earned surplus may not return to a positive position as soon as expected 
although no assurance can be given  management believes that the approvals for the payment of dividends in amounts consistent with those paid in the past can be obtained 
in the event such approvals are not obtained  management believes that lnc can obtain the funds required to satisfy its obligations from its existing credit facilities and other sources 
effect of inflation lnc s insurance affiliates  as well as other companies in the insurance industry  attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on their revenues and expenses by anticipating inflationary trends in the pricing of their products 
inflation  except for changes in interest rates  does not have a significant effect on lnc s balance sheet due to the minimal amount of dollars invested in property  plant and equipment and the absence of inventories 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures of financial instruments lnc analyzes and manages the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments  as well as other risks  in an integrated asset liability management process that takes diversification into account 
by aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks of the entire enterprise  lnc estimates  reviews and in some cases manages the risk to its earnings and shareholder value 
lnc has material exposures to several market risks including interest rate  default risk  foreign currency exchange and equity price risks 
the exposures of financial instruments to market risks  and the related risk management processes  are most important in the life insurance and annuities segment 
this segment is where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
as an important element of its integrated asset liability management process  lnc uses derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest rate levels and the shape of the yield curve 
in this context  derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of large rises in interest rates on lnc s stream of earnings 
additional market exposures exist in lnc s other general account insurance products and in its debt structure and derivatives positions 
the primary sources of market risk are substantial  relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates  fluctuations in currency exchange rates a sharp drop in equity market values 
each of these market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages 
interest rate risk accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
general account assets supporting accumulation and investment oriented insurance products total billion or and billion or of total invested assets at december  and  respectively 
fixed maturity and equity securities are held at fair value on the balance sheet  mortgage loans on real estate are held at amortized cost and real estate is held at cost less depreciation while liabilities are generally held at account values less surrender charges see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the fair values for mortgage loans on real estate and guaranteed interest rate contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis while fixed annuities and other deposit liabilities are at policy cash surrender value see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
with respect to these products  lnc seeks to earn a stable and profitable spread between investment income and interest credited to account values 
if lnc has adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed onto customers  its spreads are reduced 
alternatively  lnc may seek to maintain spreads and this may result in crediting rates that are not competitive in the market place 
this strategy could result in adverse surrender experience on policies and could force lnc to liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fund excess cash surrender value benefits 
lnc does not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material 
the combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months  asset liability management strategies  flexibility in adjusting crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to minimize this risk 
the interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 
fixed deferred annuities 
assets of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  supports the biggest category of accumulation and investment oriented insurance products  fixed deferred annuities 
for these products  lnc may adjust renewal crediting rates monthly or annually  subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to 
the higher minimums apply to in force blocks of older products that no longer are sold 
annuity insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
due to lnc s ability to change crediting rates to reflect investment experience  the underlying assets are assumed to be a good proxy for the interest rate risk inherent in these liabilities 
this assumption is appropriate for probable movements in interest rates over the next months 
this assumption may not be appropriate for a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 
universal life 
lnc had billion and billion in assets at december  and  respectively  supporting universal life insurance on which it has the right to adjust renewal crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to at december  similar to annuities  universal life insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
guaranteed interest contracts and group pension annuities 
lnc had assets totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively  that support guaranteed interest contracts  group pension annuities and immediate annuities 
generally  the cash flows expected on these liabilities do not vary with fluctuations in market interest rates and are not adjustable by lnc 
accordingly  if experience on the assets supporting these products is more adverse than the assumptions used in pricing the products  spreads will tend to be below expectations 
lnc limits exposure to interest rate risk by managing the duration and maturity structure of each investment portfolio in relation to the liabilities it supports 
other general account insurance products 
lnc had billion and billion of assets at december  and  respectively  supporting general account products  including disability income and term life insurance 
for these products  the liability cash flows may have actuarial uncertainty 
however  their amounts and timing do not vary significantly with interest rates 
lnc limits interest rate risk by analyzing the duration of the projected cash flows and structuring investment portfolios with similar durations 
interest rate risk falling rates 
interest rates fell in  rose again in and declined in and for example  the five year treasury yield declined from in to at the end of  increased to by the end of  decreased to by the end of and decreased to by the end of under scenarios in which interest rates fall and remain at levels significantly lower than those prevailing at december   minimum guarantees on annuity and universal life insurance policies generally to or an average of approximately could cause the spread between the yield on the portfolio and the interest rate credited to policyholders to deteriorate 
select contracts that specify these minimum guarantees can be amended periodically to reflect current interest rate conditions 
the earned rate on the annuity and universal life insurance portfolios averaged and  respectively  for the year ended december   providing a cushion for further decline before the earned rates would be insufficient to cover minimum guaranteed rates plus the target spread 
the maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of this cushion for a period of time 
however  spreads would be at risk if interest rates continued to fall and remained lower for a long period 
lnc manages these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting its exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio 
lnc believes that the portfolios supporting its accumulation and investment oriented insurance products have a prudent degree of call protection individually and on a consolidated basis 
as of december  the mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs portion of the portfolio represented a total of billion or of the billion of general account assets supporting such products 
of this portfolio  of general account assets or billion is subject to residential prepayment risk from investments made in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  mortgage pass throughs  manufactured housing and home equity loans 
as of december  the mbs and abs portion of the portfolio represented a total of billion or of the billion of general account assets supporting such products 
lnc s mbs portfolio has equal to or slightly less prepayment risk than the mbs pass through market in general primarily due to holding more seasoned securities in the portfolio 
due to the combination of recent lower interest rates and increased efficiency by mortgage holders in exercising their prepayment options  the riskiness of these securities has increased over the last few years without a compensating adjustment to risk premiums 
this trend has also reduced the degree of protection provided by the purchase of protected amortization class cmos 
as a result  lnc has reduced its exposure to the mbs asset class in recent years 
interest rate risk rising rates 
for both annuities and universal life insurance  a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders 
the portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more 
accordingly  the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
as rates rise  the lag may be increased by slowing mbs prepayments 
the greater and faster the rise in interest rates  the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates 
if lnc sets renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread  the gap between its renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders 
if lnc credits more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders  its spreads will narrow 
lnc devotes extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions see discussion below 
with this hedge  the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within corporate risk tolerances 
lnc believes that the risks of rising interest rates are also mitigated by its emphasis on periodic premium products 
debt 
as of december   lnc had short term debt  long term debt and minority interest preferred securities of subsidiary companies totaling billion billion with fixed rates and million with floating rates 
as of december   lnc had short term debt  long term debt and minority  interest preferred securities of subsidiary companies totaling billion million with fixed rates and million with floating rates 
lnc manages the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise 
derivatives 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  lnc has entered into derivative transactions to reduce its exposure to rapid rises in interest rates 
the four programs discussed below are used to help lnc achieve more stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during periods when interest rates are rising 
failure to maintain competitive crediting rates could cause policyholders to withdraw their funds and place them in more competitive products 
lnc uses interest rate cap agreements to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
interest rate caps are contracts that require counterparties to pay lnc at specified future dates the amount  if any  by which a specified market interest rate exceeds the cap rate stated in the agreements  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of billion with cap rates ranging from to basis points above prevailing interest rates 
the cap rates in some contracts increase over time 
these agreements expire in through lnc also uses swaptions to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
swaptions are options to enter into a swap at a specified future date

equity market exposures lnc s revenues  assets  liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk 
fee revenues 
the fee revenues of lnc s investment management segment and fees earned from variable annuities are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values 
these fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management 
in a severe equity market decline  fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals 
such withdrawals from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to lnc s fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to lnc by its competitors customers 
assets 
while lnc invests in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in its core fixed income investments  the returns on  and values of  these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than its fixed income investments

lnc uses over the counter otc foreign currency equity call options to hedge against the foreign equity market risk component contained in its uk unit linked annuities which are a function of the financial times stock exchange ftse index 
these call options require the counterparties to pay lnc at specified future expiration dates the amount  if any  of the percentage increase in the ftse index over the strike price defined in the contract  applied to a notional amount 
lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the call options expirations are matched to the liabilities and expire in through lnc uses otc equity call options on the s p index to hedge against the increase in its liabilities resulting from certain reinsurance agreements which guarantee payment of the appreciation of the s p index on certain underlying annuity products 
these call options require the counterparty to pay lnc at specified future expiration dates the amount  if any  of the percentage increase in the s p index over the strike price defined in the contract  applied to the notional amount 
the reinsurance agreement then requires lnc to pay any appreciation on the s p index to the reinsurance client 
lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million and million for december  and  respectively 
the call options expirations are matched to the liabilities and expire in through default risk 
in assessing the risk that the rate of default losses for each category of asset may be higher than the rates assumed in pricing its products  lnc considers the entire billion portfolio of invested assets as of december   taking diversification into account 
of this total  billion consists of corporate bonds and billion consists of commercial mortgages 
lnc manages the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards  prudently limiting allocations to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates  lnc s exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry group 
lnc remains exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
as of december   lnc had a portfolio of invested assets of billion 
lnc is depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under interest rate cap agreements  swaptions  spread lock agreements  interest rate swaps  commodity swaps  call options  put options foreign currency exchange contracts  foreign currency options and foreign currency swaps 
in order to minimize the risk of default losses  lnc diversifies its exposures among several dealers and limits the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor 
lnc generally limits its selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an a credit rating or above 
credit related derivatives 
lnc periodically uses spread lock agreements to hedge a portion of the value of its fixed maturity securities against the risk of widening in the spreads between their yields and the yields of comparable maturity us or other government obligations 
as of december   lnc did not have any open spread lock agreements 
lnc uses put options  combined with various perpetual fixed income securities and interest rate swaps to replicate fixed income  fixed maturity investments 
the risk being hedged is a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns with the international bond issuers
