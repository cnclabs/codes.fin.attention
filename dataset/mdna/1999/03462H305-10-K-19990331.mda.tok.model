in december  the company received proceeds from a strategic investment by synthelabo in the amount of  as of december   the company s principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of  also as of that date  the company s liabilities exceeded its assets by  management believes that currently available funds not be sufficient to sustain the company for the next months 
such funds consist of available cash and cash equivalents  any funds received from the company s catheter ablation technology licensing agreement  product sales and any funds received with respect to the company s litigation against cpi 
reducing operating expenses and capital expenditure alone may not be sufficient to address the company s liquidity needs  and continuation as a going concern is dependent upon product sales the company s litigation against cpi and the company s ability to raise funds through equity investment  asset sales or the licensing or sales of all or part of its intellectual property 
the company is currently exploring many avenues of funding as reported earlier in this document  all of which are presently uncertain 
there is no assurance any such financing is or would become available 
in the event that the company cannot generate or otherwise obtain funding  the company would have to substantially cut back its level of operations 
these reductions could have a material adverse effect on the company s relations with its strategic partners and customers 
uncertainty exists with respect to the adequacy of current funds to support the company s activities until positive cash flow from operations can be achieved  and with respect to the availability of financing from other sources to fund any cash deficiencies 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
the propriety of using the going concern basis is dependent upon  among other things  the achievement of future profitable operations and the ability to generate sufficient cash from operations  public and private financing and other funding sources to meet its obligations 
the uncertainties described in the preceding paragraphs raise substantial doubt at december  about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets or the amount of liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties 
if the company is unable to continue as a going concern  the values realized from the company s assets may be less than the carrying amounts reported in its financial statements

these warrants expire on march  and march   respectively 
year compliance all companies that use computers must address problems that could occur when the year changes from to in the past  many computers and software used two digits instead of four to identify the year when storing and processing dates 
this practice could cause a computer to use or calculate an incorrect date as the year approaches 
the company has a year oversight team in place  and has commenced efforts to address all potential year issues 
the team has divided the project into several areas products the company manufactures  equipment used to produce and test those products  business systems  facilities  and third parties 
each area will be evaluated and brought into compliance in five phases inventory a complete list of all possible systems that may be affected by the turn of the century 
assessment review and document the impact and severity of the year issues for each system on the list 
solutions identify the various methods for resolving each issue  select the best solutions and establish an implementation plan 
implementation carry out the plan to resolve the issues 
verification test solutions prior to the year as required by the implementation plan 
all of the company s current and future products are designed  manufactured and tested to perform correctly in the next century 
all equipment used to manufacture and test these products is inventoried and will be assessed by the end of the second quarter of all critical business systems  including the company s financial systems  have completed all five phases and are compliant 
remaining non critical business systems will be assessed by the end of the second quarter of the facilities have been assessed and only one system requires a minor update to comply 
significant third party vendors have been identified  and the company expects to complete the assessment of their compliance by the end of the second quarter the company will require written documentation from third party vendors indicating that they are year compliant 
the company s objective is to complete all phases of the project in all areas by the end of the second quarter of due to the january reorganization this initiative may extend beyond expected dates but the company will continue to focus to solve any potential yk issues 
many of the company s systems were purchased or implemented within the last few years  which will keep compliance costs relatively low 
as of december   the company has incurred year related expenses of less than  the total expenditures to comply to the year issues are estimated to be no more than  however  there can be no guarantee that the actual results will not differ from those estimated 
if the company is not successful in its efforts to bring its systems in compliance  the company s ability to procure merchandise in a timely and cost effective manner may be impaired  daily business processes may be delayed by manual procedures  or business processes may be interrupted if no alternative methodology is available  which could have a material effect on the company s operations 
although  the company believes that its year compliance plan is adequate to achieve full system operation on a timely basis  the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan to address the possibility of the company s and third parties non compliance 
the company anticipates completing its contingency plan by the end of the second quarter of item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risks 
the company s primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the british pound sterling and the german deutschemark to the us dollar as the financial results of the company s two subsidiaries  angeion europe and angeion gmbh  are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arise from certain inter company payable or receivable balances 
additionally  the company has a small exposure to currency risk arising from german deutschemark denominated sales from angeion gmbh to its customers 
since sales through angeion gmbh have historically been  and are expected to be  minimal  the exposure due to the translation of german deutschemarks into us dollars is not expected to be material 
all sales from the company s us and angeion europe operations are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the investment and master strategic relationship agreement the agreement the company entered into with synthelabo in october  all of the company s european and japanese sales  with the exception of clinical studies  will be through ela medical 
all sales made to ela medical are denominated in the us dollar and have no foreign currency exchange rate risk to the company 
any future operations at angeion europe and angeion gmbh are not expected to have any material impact on the company s foreign exchange rate exposure 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s financial results for the year ended december   the five month transition period ended december  and the years ended july  and was not material 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk 
because foreign exchange exposure to these rate fluctuations increases as sales and inter company balances grow  the company will continue to evaluate the need to initiate hedging programs to mitigate the impact on inter company balances due to changes in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling and the german deutschemark to the u 
s dollar

the uk is one of the four countries of the eu that did not adopt the euro as its legal currency effective january   however  the uk may convert to the euro at a later date 
the conversion of the deutschemark into the euro is not expected to result in any significant pricing changes 
as a result of the investment and master strategic relationship agreement the agreement the company entered into with synthelabo in october  all of the company s european and japanese sales  with the exception of clinical studies  will be through ela medical 
all sales made to ela medical are denominated in the us dollar and have no foreign currency exchange rate risk to the company 
any future operations at angeion europe and angeion gmbh are not expected to have any material impact on the company s euro foreign exchange rate exposure 
the company is in the process of addressing any issues raised by the conversion to the euro 
the company does not presently expect that the conversion to the euro will result in any material increase in costs to the company 
while the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro conversion over time  based upon currently available information  management does not believe that the conversion to the euro currency will have a material impact on the company s financial condition or over all trends in result of operations
