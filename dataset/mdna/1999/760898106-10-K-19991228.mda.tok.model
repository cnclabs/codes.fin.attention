year the year presents potential concerns for business and consumer computing 
in addition to the well known calculation problems with the use of digit date formats as the year changes from to  the year is a special case leap year and in many organizations using older technology  dates were used for special programmatic functions 
the problem exists for many kinds of software and hardware  including mainframes  mini computers  pcs  and embedded systems 
the consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business process interruption 
at the end of fiscal  all of the company s critical and priority manufacturing and non manufacturing systems were determined to be already year capable  or necessary remediation replacements  changes  upgrades or workarounds had been determined and unit testing and deployment had been completed 
the company continues to work on internal systems that were not categorized as critical or priority  and expects to have work on these systems substantially completed by the end of calendar the company has also been actively working with suppliers of products and services to determine the extent to which the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year capable  and to monitor their progress toward year capability 
the company has made inquiries of its major suppliers and has received responses to its inquiries from of critical suppliers 
follow up activities seek to determine whether the supplier is taking all appropriate steps to fix year problems and to be prepared to continue functioning effectively as a supplier in accordance with the company s standards and requirements 
as with the company s suppliers  the readiness of customers  and their suppliers  to deal with year issues may affect their operations and their ability to order and pay for products 
the company has surveyed its major direct customers about their year readiness in critical areas of their operations 
the results identified certain key areas to be addressed by the customers  primarily related to supplier readiness  including external infrastructure providers  and contingency planning 
the company has also been communicating information about its own readiness to customers 
the company believes that its most reasonable likely worst case year scenarios would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with the company s internal systems or its products 
because the company has less control over assessing and remediating the year problems of third parties  the company believes the risks are greatest with infrastructure eg  electricity supply and water and sewer service  telecommunications  transportation supply channels and critical suppliers of materials and services 
the company s operations are leased 
located in eden prairie  minnesota  the facility relies on local private and governmental suppliers for electricity  water  sewer and other needed supplies 
failure of an electricity grid of an uneven supply of power  for example  would be a worst case scenario that would completely shut down the facility 
electrical failure could also shut down airports and other transportation facilities 
the company does not maintain facilities that would generate sufficient electrical or water supply for full operations 
a worst case scenario involving a critical supplier of materials would be the partial or complete shutdown of the supplier and its resulting inability to provide critical supplies to the company on a timely basis 
the company does not maintain the capability to replace most third party supplies with internal production 
where efforts to work with critical suppliers to ensure year capability have not been successful  contingency planning includes provisions for extra raw materials above that needed for normal operations  staffing with critical personnel on january st and scheduling the new year s holiday to provide extra time for recovery in the event it is needed 
because of the company s internal year program  the company does not believe there is a significant risk of disruption of operations due to malfunction of its internal systems or equipment 
the company is not in a position to identify or to avoid all possible scenarios  however  the company is currently assessing scenarios and taking steps to mitigate the impacts of various scenarios if they were to occur 
preliminary contingency plans for critical business operations were in place by the end of due to the large number of variables involved  the company cannot provide an estimate of the damage it might suffer if any of these scenarios  or a combination of scenarios  were to occur 
the company s year efforts have been undertaken with its existing personnel 
activities with suppliers and customers have also involved their staffs and consultants 
to date  the company has not incurred any material expenditure in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
the company has incurred the majority of its costs from the recent installation of an update to its business computer system consisting primarily of year software upgrades as well as the opportunity cost of time spent by employees of the company evaluating year compliance matters 
because the company did not accelerate the installation of the software upgrades  it does not consider the costs related thereto to be charges for year compliance 
in addition  potential costs related to customer or other claims  or potential amounts related to executing contingency plans  such as costs incurred as a result of an infrastructure or supplier failure have not been reserved 
all expected costs are based on the current assessment of the programs and are subject to change as the programs progress 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations  however  its is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier  customer or another party would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations through business interruption or shutdown  financial loss  reputational damage and legal liability to third parties 
inflation in the past three years  inflation has not had a significant effect on operations
