the increase in ias revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of cincinnati machine and r b machine tool  which are discussed below 
startup issues on a new product line at lamb honsberg in germany impacted operating profit in in addition  the ias segment began several new projects in that are not expected to materially affect sales and profits until next year 
delays caused by unexpected customer changes were encountered in the engineering phase of these new projects

ias backlog increased from million at december  to million at december  ads segment sales increased million or and operating profit increased or for the year ended december  compared with the corresponding prior period 
the sales and operating profit increases are due primarily to new licensing revenues  internal growth and the contribution of a full year of operations and the realization of improved profitability from the integration of the norand and ubi acquisitions  offset by information system problems that negatively impacted the results of the third and fourth quarter 
these problems  which were caused by the larger volume of business that resulted from the integration  did not allow the ads segment to fully realize the benefits of its integration activities in a new information system  designed to resolve these problems  will become operational during in october  unova acquired the machine tool business of cincinnati milacron for approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments

this acquisition was funded using short term uncommitted credit lines 
in june  the company acquired the radio frequency identification rfid business unit of amtech corporation known as the amtech systems division amtech systems 
amtech systems is a supplier of wireless data technologies for electronic toll collection  rail and motor fleet tracking  and access control to parking and other structures 
the company had previously purchased million of amtech corporation common stock which was applied towards the purchase price of amtech systems 
depreciation and amortization increased from million to million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to higher amortization of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the norand and ubi acquisitions  as well as additional depreciation from capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  however  as a percentage of sales  sg a remained constant at in both years 
the increase in the amount is due primarily to acquisitions as well as the increase in the company s sales and service revenues over the prior year 
net interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to an increase in outstanding debt due primarily to the acquisitions of norand and ubi in and cincinnati machine  r b machine and amtech systems in other income  net consists of a gain of million recognized on the sale of unova s corporate headquarters building  offset by other non operating expenses

ias revenues decreased million  or and related operating profit increased million  or for the year ended december  compared with the corresponding prior period 
the decrease in ias revenues is primarily attributable to the sale of the material handling systems mhs division in november  which offsets an increase in integrated manufacturing systems revenues 
ias experiences lower profit margins in the early stages of long term contracts until the development risks have been mitigated 
during the integrated manufacturing systems operations experienced a higher level of revenues and profits from contracts in the final delivery and installation phase 
these projects contributed to an increase in operating margins for ias from in to in accordingly  ias backlog declined from million at december  to million at december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued also contributing to the increased operating profit are nonrecurring costs recorded in associated with the mhs sale and the reorganization of the company s ias european operations and domestic grinding businesses 
ads revenues increased by million  or due to the acquisitions of norand corporation norand and united barcode industries ubi 
however  ads operating profit declined by million  or due primarily to the process of integrating the newly acquired companies with intermec and the costs of a long term contract related to wireless rfid technology purchased from ibm corporation 
the company acquired norand on march   and ubi on april  norand designs  manufactures and markets mobile computing systems and wireless data communications networks using radio frequency technology 
ubi is a european based automated data collection company headquartered in sweden

both transactions were funded by wai borrowings and cash on hand  and have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the acquisition costs approximately million and million for norand and ubi  respectively were allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their relative fair values 
such allocation resulted in million assigned to in process research and development activities  million assigned to goodwill amortized over years  and million assigned to other intangibles amortized over periods ranging from to years

the increase in allocated debt is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of norand and ubi 
foreign currency transactions the company is subject to the effects of international currency fluctuations due to the global nature of its operations 
currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on operations during fiscal years  and it is not possible to predict the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations beyond the near term because revenues generated from particular foreign jurisdictions vary widely over time 
the company hedges transactions from time to time  but the amount and volume of such transactions are not material 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for fiscal year  the company derived approximately of its revenues and approximately of its operating profits exclusive of corporate overhead from non us operations 
at december   identifiable assets attributable to foreign operations comprised of total assets 
as the largest components of these foreign assets are attributable to european operations  the exposure of identifiable assets to foreign currency fluctuations or expropriations is not significant 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities increased from million at december  to million at december  total debt increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the acquisitions of cincinnati machine  r b machine and amtech systems and the normal capital expenditure and working capital needs of the operations 
in march  the company sold million principal amount of senior unsecured debt 
the sale comprised million of seven year notes  at a price of and million of ten year notes  at a price of 
including underwriting fees  discounts and effects of forward rate agreements entered into by the company to hedge the interest rates on the debt  the effective interest rates on the seven year and ten year notes are and  respectively

under these credit facilities  the company may borrow at the prime rate or at rates based on the london inter bank offered rate  certificates of deposit or other rates that are mutually acceptable to the banks and the company 
at february   million of these credit facilities was available for the company s general use 
in addition  the company maintains other uncommitted credit facilities and lines of credit of which million was available to the company at february  the company expects that cash flow from operations  along with available borrowing capacity  will be adequate to meet working capital requirements 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs designed to define a year using two digits rather than four 
as such  a date sensitive field using could be recognized as the year rather than the year  potentially causing the worst case scenario of a system failure or other business disruption 
the operating segments of the company formed internal review teams to address the year issue 
the teams are monitored on an ongoing basis by executive management 
as a result of this review  the company has identified its significant information technology and non information technology systems that will require modification to ensure year compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and test year compliance 
although there can be no assurance that the company will identify and correct every year problem  the company believes that it has in place a comprehensive program to identify and correct any such problems 
the company plans to complete the internal modification and testing process prior to december  unova is also actively working with its significant suppliers and customers to assess their year compliance efforts and the company s exposure to them 
while the company currently does not anticipate problems related to third party year issues  the company will continue to assess potential risk from third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that year problems originating with a supplier or other third party will not occur 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has also assessed the capability of its products to determine whether they are year compliant 
the company believes that all of its current products are year compliant 
unova has not tested products that are no longer sold by the company and the company does not believe it is legally responsible for costs incurred by customers related to ensuring their year capability 
however  the company is providing customer support and customer satisfaction services related to year issues 
unova defines year compliant as a product that  when used properly and in conformity with the product information provided by the company  will accurately transition data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  including leap year calculations  provided that all other technology used in combination with the product properly exchanges data with the unova product 
in addition  the company has begun internal discussions concerning contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems and third parties 
if deemed necessary  these contingency plans will be developed prior to december  the company estimates that the total incremental cost of these year compliance activities will be approximately million 
of these costs  it is estimated that approximately million are expense items and the remaining million are capitalizable 
as of december   the company has incurred approximately million of year costs of which about thousand was expensed and approximately million was capitalized 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modification are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that year issues will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  the year problem has many aspects and potential consequences  some of which are not reasonably foreseeable  and there can be no assurance that unforeseen consequences will not arise 
inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations
