sales and marketing  international sales and customer support 
we market our products worldwide utilizing a multi channel strategy of direct and indirect sales through independent software distributors  major retail chains and resellers 
sales and marketing we sell our products to individuals and corporate users primarily through distributors and resellers 
our products are available to customers through channels that include distributors  retail  mail order  corporate resellers  value added resellers  original equipment manufacturers  partnerships  education and consulting 
we also sell product upgrades and some of our products through the use of direct mail and over the internet 
we sell corporate site licenses through our distribution and corporate reseller channels 
we maintain distribution relationships with major independent distributors 
these distributors stock our products for redistribution to independent dealers  consultants and other resellers 
we also maintain relationships with major retailers  while marketing to these retailers through independent distributors 
our sales force works closely with our major distributor and reseller accounts to manage the flow of orders  inventory levels and sell through to customers 
we also work closely with them to manage promotions and other selling activities 
our agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
these distributors are not within our control and are not obligated to purchase products from us 
these distributors also represent other vendors product lines 
for information with respect to customers that represent more than of our revenues  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to various limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return products through dealers and distributors for a full refund  within a reasonable period from the date of purchase 
retailers may return older versions of products 
various distributors and resellers have different return policies that may negatively impact the level of products that are returned to us 
product returns occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors order too much product 
in addition  competitive factors often require us to offer rights of return for products that distributors or retail stores are unable to sell 
our marketing activities include o advertising in trade  technical and business publications  o on line advertising  o public relations  o cooperative marketing with distributors  resellers and dealers  o direct mailings to existing and prospective end users  and o participation in trade and computer shows

volume incentive rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded 
from time to time  we also make rebates available to end users of various products acquired through major retailers 
end user rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded 
international revenues international revenues  or revenues outside of north america  represented approximately  and of our net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of our net revenues from various european regions are derived from sales by affiliates of our major united states distributors 
in other countries  we sell our products through authorized distributors 
in some countries  these distributors are restricted to specified territories 
we typically adapt products for local markets 
we adapt products by translating the documentation and software  where necessary  and preparing marketing programs for each local market 
we have marketing offices in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  czech republic  denmark  france  germany  holland  hong kong  italy  japan  korea  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  norway  russia  singapore  south africa  sweden  switzerland  taiwan  united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
these local offices facilitate our marketing and distribution in international markets 
our international operations are subject to various risks common to international operations  including o government regulations  o import restrictions  o currency fluctuations  o repatriation restrictions  and o in some jurisdictions  reduced protection for our copyrights and trademarks 
customer support our product support program provides a wide variety of free and fee based technical support services to our customers 
we provide customers with free support via electronic and automated services as well as to days free telephone support for selected products 
in august  we introduced liveupdate  which provides online access to application bug fixes and or patches for most of our currently marketed and developed products 
in addition  we offer both domestic individual users and domestic corporate customers a variety of fee based options designed to meet their technical support requirements 
we revise these fee based support programs from time to time as customer requirements change and as market trends dictate 
fee based technical support services did not generate material revenues in any fiscal year presented and are not expected to generate material revenues in the near future 
product development  partnerships and acquisitions 
we use a multiple product sourcing strategy that includes  as necessary o internal development  o licensing from third parties  and o acquisitions of technologies  product lines or companies

in addition  elements of some of our products are licensed from third party developers 
we use strategic acquisitions  as necessary  to provide certain technology  people and products for our overall product strategy 
we have completed a number of acquisitions and dispositions of technologies  companies and products and may acquire and dispose of other technologies  companies and products in the future 
as discussed in the introduction to this item  during fiscal  we acquired quarterdeck  intel s and ibm s anti virus businesses  and binary s operations 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
competition 
the microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid changes in technology 
it is influenced by the strategic direction of major microcomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers 
our competitiveness depends on our ability to enhance existing products and to offer successful new products on a timely basis 
we have limited resources and must restrict product development efforts to a relatively small number of projects 
examples of key competitors for products of our security and assistance unit include o virusscan and dr 
solomon anti virus tool kit from network associates  inoculan from computer associates international  inc  trend micro  inc s interscan viruswall and pc cillin corp 
edition  which compete with our norton antivirus product  o virex and mcafee virusscan from network associates  which compete with our norton antivirus for macintosh product  o uninstaller from network associates and windelete from imsi corporation  which compete with our norton cleansweep product  o drive image pro from powerquest corporation  rapideploy from altiris  inc and micro house international s imagecast ic  which compete with our norton ghost product  o mcafee office from network associates  which competes with our norton systemworks product  o mcafee first aid and mcafee nuts bolts from network associates  mijenix corporation s fix it utilities  techtool pro from micromat  inc and executive software international  inc 
s diskeeper  which compete with our norton utilities product  o pc clinic from network associates and updates 
com from updates 
com  which compete with our norton web services product  o transcentury office from platinum technology ip  inc  greenwich mean time s check client server and wrq  inc s express software manager  which compete with our norton corporate edition product  and o greenwich mean time s check  mcafee toolbox from network associates and intelliquis intellifix  which compete with our norton product for the consumer 
examples of key competitors for products of our remote productivity solutions unit include o contact managers  such as goldmine from goldmine software corporation and maximizer from multiactive software  inc and less directly  personal information managers  such as organizer from ibm s lotus division  outlook from microsoft corporation and sidekick from starfish software  inc  which compete with our act product  o dynamicaccess from com corporation and netswitcher from netswitcher  which compete with our norton mobile essentials product  o pcanywhere competes with laplink from traveling software  inc  reachout from stac software  inc  carbon copy from compaq computer corporation and timbuktu from netopia  inc o hotfax messagecenter by smith micro software  inc  communicate pro and communicate by communique  which compete with our talkworks pro product  and o hotfax messagecenter from smith micro software and communique s communicate products in the broader fax and voice messaging market  which compete with our winfax pro product 
examples of key competitors for products of our internet tools unit include o jbuilder client server from inprise corporation  visualage for java enterprise from ibm and powerj from sybase  inc  which compete with our symantec visual cafe database edition and symantec visual cafe enterprise suite products  o microsoft s visual j  inprise s jbuilder professional  ibm s visualage for java professional  supercede by supercede inc and sun microsystems  inc s java workshop  which compete with our symantec visual cafe professional edition product  and o microsoft s visual j  inprise s jbuilder professional and ibm s visualage for java standard  which compete with our symantec visual cafe standard edition product 
price competition is sometimes intense with some products in the microcomputer business software market 
we expect price competition to continue to increase and become even more significant in the future  which may reduce our profit margins 
we also face competition from a number of other products that offer levels of functionality different from those offered by our products or that were designed for a somewhat different group of end users than those targeted by us 
operating system vendors such as microsoft have added features to new versions of their products that provide some of the same functions traditionally offered in our products 
microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities in windows and windows and we believe this trend will continue 
while we plan to continue to improve our products with a view toward providing enhanced functionality over that provided in current and future operating systems  these efforts may be unsuccessful and any improved products may not be commercially accepted by users 
we will also continue to attempt to work with operating system vendors in an effort to make our products compatible with those operating systems 
at the same time  we intend to differentiate our utility products from features included in operating systems 
however  our efforts may be unsuccessful 
the demand for some of our products  including those currently under development  may decrease  if  among other reasons o microsoft includes additional product features in future releases of windows  o hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  or o competitors license certain of their products to microsoft or original equipment manufacturers for inclusion in their operating systems or products 
in addition  we compete with other microcomputer software companies for access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
we also compete with other software companies to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we do 
we believe that competition in the industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand their product lines into additional product categories 
manufacturing 
our product development organization produces a set of master cd roms or diskettes and documentation for each product that are then duplicated and packaged into products by the manufacturing organization 
all of our domestic manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by an outside contractor under the supervision of our manufacturing organization 
domestic purchasing of all raw materials is done by symantec personnel in our cupertino  california facility 
the manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside organizations include the duplication of diskettes and replication of cd roms  printing of documentation materials and assembly of the final packages 
we perform diskette duplication and assembly of the final package in our dublin  ireland manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside of the united states and canada 
all of our international cd rom replication is performed by outside contractors in dublin  ireland 
intellectual property 
we regard our software as proprietary 
we attempt to protect our software technology by relying on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret and trademark laws  restrictions on disclosure and other methods 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
furthermore  other parties have asserted and may  in the future  assert infringement claims against us 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
these claims and any resultant litigation  may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights 
litigation  even litigation that is not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
employees 
as of march   we employed approximately  people  including  in sales  marketing and related staff activities  in product development and in management  manufacturing  administration and finance 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages 
we believe that relations with our employees are good 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  which necessitates the continued availability of stock options and shares to be issued under our employee stock option and purchase plans and requires ongoing shareholder approval of such incentive programs 
item properties 
our principal locations  all of which are leased  are as follows approximate expiration size of location purpose in square feet lease north america cupertino  california corporate headquarters administration  sales and marketing world headquarters plan to vacate by november   city center move in by november   emerging business and research and development  remote productivity solutions city center santa monica  california research and development  and marketing eugene  oregon customer service and technical  support beaverton  oregon research and development  sales  and marketing melville  new york research and development and  marketing sunnyvale  california sub leased space  toronto  canada research and development  sales  and technical support international leiden  holland administration  sales  marketing  and technical support dublin  ireland administration  manufacturing  and translations our principal administrative  sales and marketing facility  as well as certain research and development and support facilities  are located in cupertino  california

the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely due to sales of windows and windows nt versions of our principal products  as well as introduction of new products and growth in sales outside of north america 
business units 
during fiscal and  we experienced increased net revenues over the prior fiscal year from our security and assistance  remote productivity solutions and internet tools segments  while our corporate sunset segment had declining revenues 
our security and assistance business unit represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
increased net revenues for this business unit in fiscal were primarily due to sales of norton antivirus 
new product releases of norton systemworks and norton ghost also contributed to the fiscal net revenue increase 
these year over year increases were partly offset by reductions in net revenues for norton utilities 
increased net revenues for this business unit in fiscal as compared to fiscal were primarily due to sales of windows  windows nt and macintosh versions of norton utilities  as well as the multi platform workstations servers version of norton antivirus 
new product releases of norton crashguard deluxe and norton uninstall contributed to the fiscal net revenue increase 
our remote productivity solutions business unit represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
despite the reduced percentage of revenue from this business unit  absolute net revenues for this business unit increased in fiscal over fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased sales of pcanywhere 
increased net revenues for this business unit in fiscal as compared to fiscal were primarily due to increased sales of winfax pro for windows  pcanywhere and act our internet tools business unit represented approximately of total net revenues in each of the fiscal years  and this business unit s net revenues in absolute dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and also increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in both comparative years were due to increased sales of our visual cafe database and professional editions 
our corporate sunset segment s revenues are generated from sales of products that are nearing the end of their life cycles 
net revenues from this segment were less than of net revenues for fiscal and and of our net revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  the financial impact of product price reductions for certain of our principal products was more than offset by the increase in the volume of products sold  resulting in increased net revenues 
international 
net revenues from international sales  or revenues outside of north america  were million and million and represented and of net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was largely due to stronger sales to europe and japan 
net revenues from international sales increased by million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase in net revenues was the result of our penetration of new and emerging markets in latin america and asia pacific  as well as increased sales in europe 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal  and did not materially affect annual revenue 
product returns 
we estimate and maintain reserves for product returns 
product returns principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of the products 
the mix of products returned from the distributors resellers as compared to products sold to the distributors resellers does not impact the gross margins  as symantec s gross margins are consistent across its various product families 
changes in the level of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by a change in the level of gross revenue 
as a result  the product returns provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period presented 
gross margin 
gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and amortization and write off of capitalized software 
gross margin was of net revenues in fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal factors contributing to an increase in gross margin percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal include reduction of direct material costs  which were accomplished by shifting product media from more expensive diskettes to lower priced cd roms and reductions in the size of bound manuals  accomplished through a shift in documentation for our principal products from paper manuals to electronic manuals 
additional cost reductions occurred in manufacturing overhead costs due to improved economies of scale and reductions in capitalized software amortization and write offs as discussed below 
purchased product rights and capitalized software 
as indicated in the overview  during fiscal we acquired quarterdeck  intel s anti virus business and binary s operations  as a result of these transactions we recorded purchased product rights and technology of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
during fiscal  software development costs did not materially affect us 
amortization of purchased product rights and capitalized software totaled approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to additional amortization related to developed technologies acquired from intel s anti virus business  binary and quarterdeck from the date of acquisition 
the amortization will occur over the next to years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k research and development expenses 
we charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred 
research and development expenses remained flat at for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net revenues and represented of total company net revenues in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal from fiscal largely resulted from our decision to cease development of certain software products no longer actively marketed by us 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in both years was a result of increased spending on new product development 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal  and remained flat at as a percentage of net revenues for both fiscal and the sales and marketing expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this absolute increase in sales and marketing dollars for fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to increased headcount  as well as increased spending in advertising and promotional expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to increased international sales and marketing 
in process research and development expenses 
as indicated in the overview  in fiscal  we acquired ibm s and intel s anti virus businesses  binary s operations and quarterdeck 
the following table outlines the value of the intangible assets recorded in connection with these acquisitions allocated purchase price components in thousands purchase in process developed customer prepaid price r d software goodwill base workforce tradename r d ibm     binary     intel    of quarterdeck     of quarterdeck    total        we wrote off approximately million in in process research and development associated with the ibm  binary  intel and quarterdeck purchases 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses 
we are using the acquired in process research and development associated with these acquisitions to create new anti virus products and enhanced management and administrative capabilities to be integrated into our suite of anti virus offerings and other corporate products over the next two years 
this in process technology will also be used to create new uninstall and disk cloning products 
the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features  functions and performance 
we expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
however  there are no assurances that this will occur 
if we fail to complete these products in their entirety  or in a timely manner  we may not continue to attract new users  we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired 
we determined the fair value of the in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects  including the cost to complete the in process technologies and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
ibm 
the in process technology acquired in the ibm purchase primarily consisted of the ibm immune system technology and related anti virus patents 
this technology is designed to detect previously unknown viruses  analyze them and distribute a cure  all automatically and faster than existing methods 
we intend to integrate this technology into our suite of anti virus products and engage in considerable amount of infrastructure enhancement required for its deployment throughout we assumed that revenue attributable to this in process technology would increase substantially during the first year and then decrease at rates of to during the remaining three years of the four year projection 
we projected annual revenues to range from approximately million to million over the term of the projection 
we based these projections on o penetration into ibm s and our existing installed base of customers  o anticipated growth rates of the anti virus markets  o an accelerated growth of new customers during the first year of delivering immune system technology  and o the estimated life of the underlying technologies 
based on our historical experience with similar products  we estimated marketing and sales expenses for the in process technology to be as a percentage of revenue throughout the valuation period 
based on our historical general and administrative expenses  we estimated general and administrative expenses to be throughout the period of analysis 
we assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges would be approximately million during the first year 
we assumed that it would decrease at annual rates ranging from to during the remaining periods  resulting in annual operating profits ranging between approximately million and million 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of in process technologies from ibm as of the date of the agreement to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be approximately complete at that time 
we projected the introduction of acquired in process technologies in early mid and now expect the introduction to take place in the second half of we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technology from ibm  which we believe to reflect the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate is higher than our weighted average cost of capital of due to the fact that the technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the immune system and related anti virus technology acquired from ibm were made based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
binary 
the in process technology acquired in the binary acquisition primarily consisted of disk cloning technologies associated with ghost  the flagship product of binary 
ghost software is designed to create a complete image of a hard drive in the form of a single file that can be copied to another computer connected via a network 
we assumed that revenue attributable to binary s in process technology will increase in the first three years of the five year projection period at annual rates ranging from to and then decrease at rates of to over the remaining periods as other technologies enter the marketplace 
we projected annual revenues to range from approximately million to million over the projected period 
we based these estimates on o aggregate growth rates for the business as a whole  o individual product revenues  o anticipated product development cycles  and o the life of the underlying technology 
we estimated marketing and sales expenses for the in process technology to be as a percentage of revenue throughout the valuation period 
based on our historical general and administrative expenses  we estimated general and administrative expenses to be throughout the period of analysis 
we projected operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to increase from less than million during the first year to approximately million during the third year 
we projected that operating profits would then decrease from to during the remaining two years  resulting in profits of approximately million and million 
because we assumed that most product development costs would be incurred in the first year  reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years  we anticipate operating profit to increase faster than revenue in the early years 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of in process technologies from binary as of the date of the acquisition to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be approximately complete at that time 
we projected the introduction of acquired in process technologies in early mid and this has been completed 
we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technologies from binary  which we believe to reflect the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate is higher than our weighted average cost of capital of due to the fact that the technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the disk cloning technologies acquired from binary were made based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
intel 
the in process technology acquired in the intel purchase consists of the landesk anti virus technology which resides in the landesk virus protect product line  ldvp 
the ldvp product offers centrally managed virus protection to computer networks 
we intend to initially sell the next version of ldvp software on a standalone basis 
we anticipate that during this technology will be integrated into our suite of corporate anti virus offerings  in addition to future corporate products 
we assumed revenue attributable to intel s in process technology to be approximately million during the first year  increasing to approximately million during the second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from to during the remaining three years of the five year projection as other technologies enter the marketplace 
we projected annual revenues to range from approximately million to million over the projected period 
we based these estimates on o revenue estimates of the acquired ldvp business  o aggregate growth rates for the anti virus business as a whole  o anticipated revenue to be earned from future corporate product offerings  o anticipated product development cycles  and o the life of the underlying technology 
based on our historical experience with similar products  we estimated marketing and sales expenses for the in process technology to be as a percentage of revenue throughout the valuation period 
based on our historical general and administrative expenses  we estimated general and administrative expenses to be throughout the period of analysis 
we assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to be approximately million during the first year  increasing by during the second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from to during the remaining periods  resulting in annual operating profits ranging between approximately million and less than million 
we assumed a growth rate for operating profits  which are slightly higher than revenue projections  when projecting the operating profit during the early years 
the higher growth rate is attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above as the technology is integrated more deeply into our product offerings  while research costs remain constant 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of in process technologies from intel as of the date of the product being delivered to us to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be complete at that time 
we projected the introduction of acquired in process technologies in early mid and this has been completed 
we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technology from intel  which we believe reflected the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate is higher than our weighted average cost of capital of due to the fact that the technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the landesk anti virus technology acquired from intel were made based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
quarterdeck 
the in process technology acquired in our acquisition of quarterdeck consisted of projects related to quarterdeck s cleansweep product line 
the cleansweep product line is designed to enhance the performance of the windows operating system by finding and removing outdated  unnecessary  or unwanted files  applications and system components  thereby freeing up disk space 
the following discussion relates to our purchase of a interest in november we assumed revenue attributable to the in process technology to be approximately million during the first year and then declining at annual rates of to during the remaining periods of the six year projection period as other technologies are released into the marketplace 
we projected annual revenues to range from approximately million to million over the projected period 
we based these projections on o aggregate revenue estimates for the business as a whole  o anticipated revenue derived from being able to increase our penetration in the uninstaller market  o anticipated growth rates in the utilities suites markets  o anticipated product development cycles  and o the life of the underlying technology 
based on indications from similar companies  we estimated overall sales  marketing and general and administrative expenses to be throughout the valuation period 
we assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to be approximately million during the first year  increasing by during the second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from to during the remaining periods  resulting in annual operating profits ranging between approximately million and million 
because we assumed that most product development costs would be incurred in the first year  reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years  operating profit in early years increases as revenue declines 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition for quarterdeck in process technologies to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be complete as of the date of the acquisition 
we projected the introduction of acquired in process technologies in early mid and this is now expected to take place in the second half of we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technology from quarterdeck  which we believe reflected the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate reflects a premium above that of the risk associated with the acquired developed technology and is higher than our weighted average cost of capital 
the following discussion relates to our purchase of the remaining interest in march we assumed revenue attributable to the in process technology to be approximately million during the first year  increasing to approximately million during the second year and then declining at annual rates of to during the remaining periods of the six year projection period as other technologies are released into the marketplace 
we projected annual revenues to range from million to million over the projected period 
we based these projections on o aggregate revenue estimates for the business as a whole  o anticipated revenue derived from being able to increase our penetration in the uninstaller market  o anticipated growth rates in the utilities suites markets  o anticipated product development cycles  and o the life of the underlying technology 
based on indications from similar companies  we estimated overall sales  marketing and general and administrative expenses to be throughout the valuation period 
we assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to be approximately million during the first year  increasing by during the second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from to during the remaining periods  resulting in annual operating profits ranging between approximately million and million 
because we assumed that most product development costs would be incurred in the first year  reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years  operating profit in early years increases as revenue declines 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition for quarterdeck in process technologies to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be complete as of the date of the acquisition 
we project introduction of acquired in process technologies in mid late the percent completion is significantly lower than the percent completion of the previous purchase due to significant changes in product features  r d investment levels and introduction dates 
we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technology from quarterdeck  which we believe reflected the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate reflects a premium above that of the risk associated with the acquired developed technology and is higher than our weighted average cost of capital 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the projects related to quarterdeck s cleansweep product line were made based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
there was no in process research and development expenses in fiscal in fiscal  symantec entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain software technologies to enable web authoring for the mac os environment 
the terms of the purchase agreement provided that symantec pay million upon the signing of the agreement and the delivery of the then in process  pre beta software technologies to symantec 
at the time of this purchase  no revenues had been derived from any of the technologies acquired and revenues were not anticipated from these technologies until calendar in accordance with fas  we utilized a working model of the desktop software product essentially a beta version of the product as its point of technological feasibility for desktop products because a detailed program does not exist 
symantec had consistently utilized this point in a desktop product s development life cycle for purposes of the capitalization of software 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas  we evaluated the purchased software for technological feasibility and determined that a detailed program design did not exist 
accordingly  we accounted for the cost of the purchased computer software the same as the costs incurred to develop such software internally 
additionally  these software technologies had no alternate future use beyond the continuing development efforts of the web authoring product 
accordingly  the company expensed the cost of these software technologies and recorded an approximately million charge for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were of net revenues in fiscal and of net revenues for both fiscal and general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased by from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reductions in our information system costs 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal at a rate proportionate to net revenue growth 
this increase was the result of increased personnel expenses associated with the growth of the company 
litigation judgment 
litigation expenses that related to a judgment by a canadian court on a decade old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of delrina corporation totaled approximately million for fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
restructuring and other expenses 
during the september quarter of fiscal  we implemented a plan to restructure certain of our operations  which included outsourcing our domestic manufacturing operations 
we recorded approximately million of employee severance and outplacement expenses to reduce the workforce by approximately in both domestic and international operations 
we recorded approximately million for excess facilities and equipment from the abandonment of our manufacturing facility lease 
as of march   these activities were substantially completed 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
there were no acquisition  restructuring and other expenses incurred in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded total acquisition charges of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of fast track 
we also recorded a charge of approximately million for costs related to the restructuring of certain domestic and international sales and research and development operations  certain legal settlements and other expenses 
other charges recorded in fiscal included approximately million in connection with the write off of an equity investment 
see summary of significant accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
remaining acquisition  restructuring and other expense accruals as of march  were approximately million 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
interest income was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average invested cash balances  gains on the sale of investments and interest income received from income tax refunds 
interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal this increase was due to higher average invested cash balances 
interest expense was approximately million in and million in both fiscal and the interest expense was principally related to our convertible subordinated debentures  which were converted in february and quarterdeck s subordinated notes  that were paid off in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
other income expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses accounted for approximately million in income in  which primarily resulted from the payoff of an intercompany loan 
in fiscal there was less than million in expense and in there was approximately million in expense 
income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines 
income from sale of technologies and product lines was approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
this income is related to the sale of our electronic forms product line to jetform corporation and our network administration technologies to hewlett packard  both of which took place in fiscal for fiscal the income is net of expenses related to the sale of these technologies and product lines  which is comprised of approximately million for the write off of purchased intangibles and developed software costs and approximately million in legal  accounting and other expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal  excluding charges for acquired in process research and development expenses  was 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
our income tax rate of is lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate of primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate for our irish operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and was lower due to the utilization of previously unbenefitted losses and credits 
our tax provision for fiscal consists of two items a million tax provision or effective tax rate on income before income taxes of million  which excludes a million charge for acquired in process research and development expenses and a million tax benefit on the million charge for in process research and development 
we have established a valuation allowance for the portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to the acquired in process research and development expenses that is not expected to be realized within five years 
realization of the million of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future us taxable income 
based on our forecast of us earnings  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize this asset 
the net deferred tax asset includes a valuation allowance of approximately million 
approximately million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions  the benefit of which we will credit to equity when realized 
approximately million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to the charge for acquired in process research and development expenses  the benefit of which we do not expect to realize within five years 
the remaining million of the valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return limitations under the change of ownership rules of internal revenue code section we project our effective tax rate to be in fiscal this rate is lower than the expected us federal and state combined statutory rate of due primarily to a lower tax rate from our irish operations 
however  this projection is subject to change due to fluctuations in and the geographic allocation of earnings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fluctuations in quarterly operating results  foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments decreased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this decrease was largely due to the acquisitions of quarterdeck  binary and intel s and ibm s anti virus businesses and the repurchase of approximately million shares of our stock during the september and december quarters 
quarterdeck had issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes  or notes  due in these notes were issued to an institutional investor in a private placement pursuant to the terms of a note agreement dated march  these notes were paid in full on march  in addition to cash  short term investments and long term investments of million  we have approximately million of restricted investments related to collateral requirements under lease agreements entered into by us during fiscal and in accordance with the lease terms  these funds are not available to meet operating cash requirements 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants 
future acquisitions may cause us to be in violation of these financial covenants 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and was comprised of our net income of approximately million  plus non cash related expenses of million and a net increase in assets and liabilities of million 
net trade accounts receivable increased million to approximately million and to days sales outstanding at march  from approximately million and days sales outstanding at march  on june   the board of directors of symantec authorized the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock before december  the repurchased shares were used for employee stock purchase programs and option grants 
we completed the repurchase as of october   repurchasing approximately million shares for approximately million at prices ranging from to per share 
as of march   we were in compliance with all covenants under our bank line of credit agreement 
there were no borrowings under this line and we had less than million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this line 
future acquisitions may cause us to be in violation of the line of credit covenants 
however  we believe that if the line of credit was canceled or amounts were not available under the line  there would not be a material adverse impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the company 
if we were to sustain significant losses  we could be required to reduce operating expenses  which could result in o product delays  o reassessment of acquisition opportunities  which could negatively impact our growth objectives  and or o the requirement to pursue further financing options 
we believe that existing cash and short term investments and cash generated from operating results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year 
recent accounting pronouncements in october and march  the accounting standards executive committee acsec issued statements of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  software revenue recognition  respectively  which provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions and were effective for symantec beginning with the june  quarter 
in december  acsec issued sop  which amends certain provisions of sop and extends the deferral of the application of certain passages of sop provided by sop until the beginning of symantec s fiscal symantec early adopted sop for its financial statements and related disclosures beginning in the march quarter 
sop did not have a material affect on our results

business risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others things  those risk factors set forth in this section and elsewhere in this report 
we identify forward looking statements by words such as may  will  should  could  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue or similar terms that refer to the future 
we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our earnings and stock price are subject to significant fluctuations 
due to the factors noted below  our earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we have previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and we will need to adapt our development to these changes 
we participate in a highly dynamic industry characterized by rapid change and uncertainty related to new and emerging technologies and markets 
the recent trend toward server based applications in networks and applications distributed over the internet could have a material adverse affect on sales of our products 
future technology or market changes may cause certain of our products to become obsolete more quickly than expected 
the use of a web browser  running on either a pc or network computer  to access client server systems is emerging as an alternative to traditional desktop access through operating systems that are resident on personal computers 
if the functionality associated with this type of system access reduce the need for our products  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the market for our products is intensely competitive and we expect that competition will continue and may increase 
the microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid changes in technology 
it is influenced by the strategic direction of major microcomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers 
our competitiveness depends on our ability to enhance existing products and to offer successful new products on a timely basis 
we have limited resources and must restrict product development efforts to a relatively small number of projects 
see item business competition  for examples of key competitors for our products in each of our business units 
many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we do 
we believe that competition in the industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand their product lines into additional product categories 
introduction of new operating systems may cause significant fluctuations in our financial results and stock price 
the release and subsequent customer acceptance of current or enhanced operating systems are particularly important events that increase the uncertainty and volatility of our results 
if we are unable to successfully and timely develop products that operate under existing or new operating systems  or if pending or actual releases of the new operating systems delay the purchase of our products  our future net revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities into windows  including o telecommunications capabilities  o facsimile capabilities  which were later dropped from windows  and o data recovery utilities 
microsoft has included additional product features in windows  including o enhanced disk repair  o disk defragmentation  o system file maintenance  o isdn support  and o pptp virtual private networking 
inclusions of features such as these and any additional features by microsoft in new versions of windows  including windows and windows second edition  may decrease the demand for certain of our products  including those currently under development and products specifically intended for windows microsoft s windows operating system was introduced during the june quarter and windows second edition is anticipated to be introduced at the end of we believe that weak retail software sales during the june and september quarters compared to the march quarter may have been due  in part  to the release of windows at the end of the june quarter 
our ability to generate revenue from many of our current products and products currently under development could be less than anticipated in future periods due to reported incompatibilities by end users and delays in the purchase of our products as end users first deploy windows and windows second edition 
in addition  we may face declining sales following microsoft s introduction of windows  which was formerly known as windows nt  currently scheduled for the end of our financial results and our stock price declined significantly within approximately months after the releases of windows  windows and windows  which in some cases also caused the additional requirement for hardware upgrades  resulting in shifts in customer spending from software to hardware 
we could face adverse financial results and additional stock price declines following future releases of operating systems 
additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  the demand may decrease for some of our products  including those currently under development 
moreover  functionality previously provided only by software may be incorporated directly into hardware  potentially reducing demand for our products 
furthermore  our competitors may license certain of their products to microsoft and oems for inclusion with their operating systems  add on products or hardware  which may also reduce the demand for certain of our products 
shifts in customer spending from software to hardware as the result of technological advancements in hardware or price reductions of hardware have in the past and may in the future  result in reduced revenues which have had and would have a material adverse affect on operating results 
the trend toward consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation in the software industry continues to occur  with competing companies merging or acquiring other companies in order to capture market share or expand product lines 
as this consolidation occurs  the nature of the market may change as a result of fewer players dominating particular markets  potentially providing consumers with fewer choices 
also  some of these companies offer a broader range of products than symantec  ranging from desktop to enterprise solutions 
we may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors 
any of these changes may have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results 
furthermore  we use strategic acquisitions  as necessary  to acquire technology  people and products for our overall product strategy 
we have completed a number of acquisitions and dispositions of technologies  companies and products and may acquire and dispose of other technologies  companies and products in the future 
the trend toward consolidation in our industry may result in increased competition in acquiring these technologies  people or products  resulting in increase acquisition costs or the inability to acquire the desired technologies  people or products 
we must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment of the internet in a timely manner 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service or potential tax or other government regulation  remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products 
if we are unsuccessful in timely assimilating changes in the internet environment into our business operations and product development efforts  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
we face intense price based competition for sales of our products 
price competition is often intense in the microcomputer software market  especially for utility and anti virus products 
many of our competitors have significantly reduced the price of utility and anti virus products 
price competition may continue to increase and become even more significant in the future  resulting in reduced profit margins 
if competitive pressures in the industry continue to increase in regards to utility and anti virus products  we may be required to reduce prices and or increase our spending on sales  marketing and research and development of these products as a percentage of net revenues  resulting in lower profit margins 
these actions may be insufficient to offset the impact of price competition on our business and net revenues  and may result in reduced revenue  income and available cash 
the transition to integrated suites of utilities may result in reduced revenues 
symantec and our competitors now provide integrated suites of utility products 
the price of integrated utility suites is significantly less than the total price of stand alone products that are included in these utility suites when sold separately 
as a result of the shift to integrated utility suites  price competition is intense and we have experienced cannibalization of our stand alone products that are included within the suite 
as a result  there may be a negative impact on our revenues and operating income from selling integrated utility suites rather than individual products  as the lower price of integrated utility suites may not be offset by increases in the total volume of utility suites sold 
additionally  our products may not compete effectively with competitors products or integrated utility suites introduced in the future 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
while our diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net revenues  these fluctuations have occurred and may occur in the future 
fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors  including o the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades  o the introduction of competitive products by existing or new competitors  o reduced demand for any given product  o seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software markets  and o the market s transition between operating systems 
a significant proportion of our revenues are generated during the last month of the quarter 
most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of the fiscal quarter 
in addition  many corporate customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
in part  this is because these two groups are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms 
our reliance on a large proportion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of the quarter results in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
in addition  these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts 
absence of backlog may impact our quarterly financial results 
we operate with relatively little backlog 
therefore  if near term demand for our products weakens in a given quarter  there could be an immediate  material reduction in net revenues  which would likely result in a significant and precipitous drop in our stock price 
we have not experienced any difficulties in acquiring material or delays in production of our software and related documentation and packaging 
we normally ship products within one week after receiving an order and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance 
however  shortages may occur in the future 
we are dependent upon the retail distribution channel 
a large portion of our sales are made through the retail distribution channel  which is subject to events that create unpredictable fluctuations in consumer demand 
our retail distribution customers also carry our competitors products 
these retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory 
their decisions to purchase our products are partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by us and our competitors  over which we have no control and which we cannot predict 
our agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by the distributors or by us without cause 
some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
distributors that account for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial difficulties in the future 
when our distributors have experienced financial difficulties in the past  we have successfully moved these inventories to other distributors 
however  we may not be able to do so in the future 
if these distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to other distributors  we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in utilizing new distribution channels 
we currently offer a broad range of products and services over the internet 
we may not be able to effectively adapt our existing  or adopt new  methods of distributing our software products utilizing the rapidly evolving internet and related technologies 
the adoption of new channels may adversely impact existing channels and or product pricing  which may reduce our future revenues and profitability 
channel fill may affect our net revenues 
our pattern of net revenues and earnings may be affected by channel fill 
distributors may fill their distribution channels in anticipation of price increases  sales promotions or incentives 
distributors  dealers and end users often delay purchases  cancel orders or return products in anticipation of the availability of the new version or new product 
as a result  distributor inventories may decrease between the date we announce a new version or new product and the date of release 
channels may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell their inventories to retail distribution or retailers to end users as anticipated 
if sales to retailers or end users do not occur at a sufficient rate  distributors will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order to reduce their inventories 
the impact of channel fill is somewhat mitigated by our deferral of revenue associated with distributor and reseller inventories estimated to be in excess of appropriate levels 
however  net revenues may still be materially affected favorably or adversely by the effects of channel fill  particularly in periods where a large number of new products are simultaneously introduced 
product returns may affect our net revenues 
product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to various limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return our products through dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund 
in addition  retailers may return older versions of our products 
we estimate and maintain reserves for product returns 
however  future returns could exceed the reserves we have established  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
our increased sales of site licenses may increase fluctuations in our financial results and could affect our business 
we sell corporate site licenses through the distribution channel and through corporate resellers 
we are increasingly emphasizing sales to corporations and small businesses through volume licensing agreements 
these licensing arrangements tend to involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  if the corporate marketplace grows and becomes a larger component of the overall marketplace  we may not be successful in expanding our corporate segment to take advantage of this growth 
we often depend on joint business arrangements for product development 
we have entered into various development or joint business arrangements for the purpose of developing new software products and enhancements to existing software products as well as creating a presence in new markets 
we may continue this strategy in the future 
depending on the nature of each such arrangement  the development  distribution  sale or marketing of the resulting product may be controlled either by us or by our business partner 
the products that result from joint business arrangements may not be technologically successful  may not achieve market acceptance and or may not be able to compete with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
we depend on distribution by value added resellers and independent software vendors for a significant portion of our revenues 
we distribute some of our products through value added resellers and independent software vendors under arrangements through which our products are included with these resellers and vendors hardware products prior to sale by them through retail channels 
these licensing agreements are generally non exclusive and do not require these resellers or vendors to make minimum purchases 
if we are unsuccessful in maintaining our current relationships and securing license agreements with additional value added resellers and independent software vendors  or if these resellers and vendors are unsuccessful in selling their products  our future net revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
we may experience difficulty integrating acquisitions 
we have completed a number of acquisitions including four acquisitions in fiscal and may acquire other companies and technology in the future 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including o difficulties of integrating the operations of the acquired companies in an efficient and timely manner  o diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  o potential disruption of our existing businesses  o difficulties in successfully incorporating acquired technologies with our existing products  o difficulties of integration  training  retention and motivation of key employees of the acquired company  o the burden of presenting a unified corporate image  and o obstacles to the integration of acquired products  research and development and sales efforts 
in addition  because the employees of acquired companies have frequently remained in their existing geographically diverse locations  we have not achieved certain economies of scale that we might otherwise have realized 
further economies of scale may not be realized in the future 
we may need to secure financing to pay for future acquisitions 
acquisition financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we typically incur significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions 
future acquisitions may have a significant adverse impact on our future profitability and financial resources 
we face risks associated with our foreign operations 
we transact a significant portion of our revenues  manufacturing costs and operating expenses outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
as a result  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected by o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o increases in duty rates  o exchange or price controls or other repatriation restrictions on foreign currencies  o political and economic instability  o government regulations  o import restrictions  o economic volatility  and o reduced protection for the company s copyrights and trademarks in certain jurisdictions 
we utilize natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency transaction exposure 
we also hedge certain residual balance sheet positions through the use of one month forward contracts 
these strategies may be ineffective in the future 
we may be unsuccessful in accurately forecasting transaction gains or losses 
we expect an increase of our activities that are not denominated in us dollars in the future 
if there are continued fluctuations in the currency markets  our revenues could be materially and adversely affected 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses as with many companies in the software industry 
we base our technical support levels  in a large part  on projections of future sales levels 
over the short term  we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
while we perform extensive quality control review over the technical support services provided by our corporate personnel and  to a lesser extent  over the support services outsourced to third party vendors  customers may be dissatisfied with these services 
if we have not satisfied our customers technical support needs  future product and upgrade sales to these customers may be reduced 
the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain 
we believe that we will need to make significant research and development expenditures to remain competitive 
while we perform extensive usability and beta testing of new products  the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful 
if they are not technologically successful  our resulting products may not achieve market acceptance and our products may not compete effectively with products of our competitors currently in the market or introduced in the future 
the length of the product development cycle is difficult to predict 
the length of our product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally expected 
although such delays have undoubtedly had a material adverse affect on our business and because we are unable to predict the amount of net revenues that would have been obtained had the original development expectations been met  we are unable to quantify the magnitude of net revenues that were deferred or lost as a result of any particular delay 
we are likely to experience delays in future product development 
these delays could have a material adverse affect on the amount and timing of future revenues 
due to the inherent uncertainties of software development projects  we do not generally disclose or announce the specific expected shipment dates of our product introductions 
we may be unable to adjust expenses to fluctuations in revenues 
as with many companies in the software industry  our employee and facility related expenditures comprise a significant portion of our operating expenses 
we base our expense levels  in a large part  on projections of future revenue levels 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses over the short term  if revenue levels fall below expectations  our operating results are likely to be significantly adversely affected 
we must manage and restructure our expanding operations effectively 
we continually evaluate our product and corporate strategy 
we have in the past undertaken and will in the future undertake organizational changes and or product and marketing strategy modifications 
these changes and modifications are designed to o maximize market penetration  o maximize use of limited corporate resources  o develop new products  and o develop new product channels 
these organizational changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met due to the allocation of valuable limited resources to implement changes 
further  due to the uncertain nature of any of these undertakings  these efforts may not be successful and the company may not realize any benefit from these efforts 
we must attract and retain personnel while competition for personnel in our industry is intense 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
we may be unable to attract or retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees 
we have from time to time in the past experienced and we expect in the future to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options  which requires ongoing stockholder approval 
we depend on our internal communications systems that may be disrupted 
our order entry and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed 
if our communications between these centers are disrupted  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  we will suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results 
if communications and internet connectivity are disrupted  disruptions in communications and internet connectivity may also cause delays in customer access to our internet based services or product sales 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers and may cause delays in product development that could adversely impact our future net revenues 
we rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard our software as proprietary and underlying technology as proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws 
however  we do not employ technology to prevent copying of our products 
despite our precautionary measures  third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
all of our products are protected by copyright and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending 
we may not achieve the desired protection from  and third parties may design around  our patents 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
we are involved in litigation which could  and any future litigation may  affect our financial results 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  that our products are not year compliant or other product liability claims  or other claims incidental to our business 
we are involved in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to our business 
for a more complete discussion of our current litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
we intend to defend and or pursue all of these lawsuits vigorously 
we may suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of the cases 
we do not expect the final resolution of these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  individually or in the aggregate 
however  depending on the amount and timing of unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
intellectual property litigation we believe that software developers will become increasingly subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap 
in addition  an increasing number of patents are being issued that may apply to software 
allegations of patent infringement are becoming increasingly common in the software industry 
we are unable to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims because o new patents are being issued continually  o the subject of patent applications is confidential until a patent is issued  and o when a patent has been issued  the potential applicability of the patent to a particular software product is not apparent 
we have been involved in disputes claiming patent infringement in the past and are currently involved in a number of patent disputes and litigation 
we believe we  like other companies that obtain some of their products through publishing agreements or acquisitions  face potentially greater risks of infringement claims since we have less direct control over the development of those products 
although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations 
if a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
if we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
year product liability litigation we believe the software products that we currently develop and actively market are year compliant for significantly all functionality 
however  these products could contain errors or defects related to the year in addition  earlier versions of our products  those that are not the most currently released or are not currently being developed  may not be year compliant 
we have sold some of our older product lines  which are not being actively developed and updated 
these older products are also not necessarily year compliant and will no longer be sold after june  we are currently party to a lawsuit related to the alleged inability of pre version norton antivirus products to function properly in respect to year we believe that this lawsuit has no merit and we intend to defend against this claim vigorously 
we do not expect the final resolution of this lawsuit to have a material adverse affect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of this lawsuit  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
software defects and product liability software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
for example  in the past  our anti virus software products have incorrectly detected viruses that do not exist 
we have not experienced any material adverse effects resulting from any of these defects or errors to date and we test our products prior to release 
nonetheless  defects and errors could be found in current versions of our products  future upgrades to current products or newly developed and released products 
software defects could result in delays in market acceptance or unexpected reprogramming costs  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions limiting our liability may not be valid as a result of federal  state  local or foreign laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on symantec s business  operating results and financial condition 
our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
while we have not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of the our products  such viruses could be created and deployed against our products in the future 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site from time to time 
a hacker who penetrates our network or web site could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by virus creators and hackers 
the conversion of the european currencies to the euro may impact our foreign exchange hedging program 
on january   the euro became the common currency of of the member countries of the european union 
the national currencies of these countries will coexist with the euro at fixed exchange rates through december  euro denominated bills and coins will be introduced on january  and  by july   the national currencies will no longer be legal tender 
we established a euro task force to address the business implications of the euro 
the task force implemented changes to our system and processes in order to be euro ready on january  we will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro and expect to make further changes to accommodate doing business in the euro 
we expect that the euro will dictate changes in our foreign exchange hedging program 
these changes may lead to increased fluctuations in foreign currency hedging results 
based on current information  we do not believe that the euro will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
we may experience reduced demand for our products due to changes in customer behavior resulting from year preparation 
with the emerging requirements on year compliance and functionality  many enterprise customers may use their information technology budgets in to focus on year issues 
in addition  our customer s information technology organizations may be unwilling to deploy new software until after the year in order to reduce the complexity of any changes in their systems required by any actual year failures 
either of these factors could reduce sales of our products and could have an adverse affect on revenues 
we may experience disruption of our internal systems as a result of the year we have completed a major evaluation of our internal applications  systems and databases 
we are modifying or replacing portions of our hardware and associated software to enable our operational systems and networks to function properly with respect to dates leading up to january  and thereafter 
we continue to evaluate interfaces between our systems and third party systems  such as those of key suppliers  distributors and financial institutions  for year functionality 
in addition  the systems of other companies with which we do business may not address year problems on a timely basis 
we expect the process of evaluating third party year compliance to be an ongoing process 
we are evaluating year exposures of our key suppliers  as well as our buildings and related facilities 
we expect that the costs to complete the year project to be approximately million and will be expensed as incurred 
our year project is divided into several phases assessment where the vulnerability of the hardware  software  process or service element is identified 
planning where corrective action is determined for each vulnerable element 
remediation and unit test where the corrective action is taken and initial testing is performed 
limited system test where related elements are tested together  using dates in the vulnerable range and any necessary follow up remediation is completed 
we track the progress of the year on a sub project level 
the following table is a summary of the completion status and currently expected completion date of each phase for each sub project 
the expected completion dates are subject to the risks and uncertainties of locating and correcting errors in complex computer systems 
the actual dates on which we complete each phase may vary significantly 
some sub project completion dates have shifted since our last q filing 
we have realized that our principal software vendor will be providing delayed year patches throughout these patches need to be tested before installing them into our environment 
in order to optimize the usage of our special test environment and people resources  we have conservatively extended our limited systems test phase 
again  we realized that some of our primary hardware vendors would continue to supply delayed year fixes through and therefore we will need to prepare accordingly 
building and related facilities dates were modified to address the resources involved in the physical move of our world headquarters in the latter half of we believe that these conservative date modifications will not impair our ability to remain in business before  throughout and beyond the transition into the new millenium 
periodic updates regarding the year status are provided to both the executive staff and board of directors

we maintain business recovery plans for our major locations to provide for an orderly response to various disaster scenarios 
we are reviewing and augmenting these plans to provide contingency plans for potential internal and external year related problems 
we have scheduled completion of the analysis and the associated contingency plans for september we believe that  following our conversion to new software and modifications of existing computer hardware and software  we will not suffer significant operational problems with our computer systems due to the year however  if we are unable to complete remaining modifications and conversions in a timely manner  year noncompliance might materially adversely impact our operations 
because testing of the year functionality of our systems must occur in a simulated environment  we are unable to test fully all year interfaces and capabilities prior to the year we have not deferred any other information systems projects as a result of our focus on year compliance issues 
we believe that our exposure from year issues is not material to our business as a whole 
however  if certain key suppliers or distributors should suffer business interruptions due to year problems  we could be forced to delay product shipments 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates because of the low levels of marketable securities on our balance sheet 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
as of march   the fair market value of our financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was approximately million 
sensitivity analysis for a six month horizon was performed on our floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate liabilities 
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis point of our weighted average interest rate would result in fair market values for investments of approximately million as well as with a basis point increase and basis point decrease in interest rates 
fair market values of floating rate financial obligations would increase by less than million for a basis point rise and decrease by less than million with a basis point decrease in interest rates 
exchange rate sensitivity 
we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  or forward contracts  of one fiscal month duration to hedge various foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts to mitigate the risk of material foreign currency transaction losses 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
at the end of each fiscal month  all foreign currency assets and liabilities are revalued using the month end spot rate of the maturing forward contracts and the realized gains and losses are recorded and included in net income as a component of other income expense 
we believe that the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact market risk exposure may have on the fair market values of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our foreign currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments  principally forward contracts 
the sensitivity analysis assesses the risk of loss in fair market values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive instruments over a six month horizon 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
as of march   the net fair value liability of our financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately million 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately million or an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately million 
this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments
