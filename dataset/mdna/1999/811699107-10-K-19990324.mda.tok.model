the company has experienced fluctuations in the number of orders being placed from quarter to quarter 
the company believes this is principally attributable to the buying patterns and budgeting cycles of television operators and broadcast companies  the primary buyers of digital advertising insertion systems and broadcast systems  respectively 
the company expects that there will continue to be fluctuations in the number and value of orders received and that at least in the near future  the company s revenue and results of operations will reflect these fluctuations

in  the increases in costs of systems revenues reflect increased manufacturing labor and overhead costs incurred to support changes in the product mix  including the introduction of the broadcast products 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in systems gross profit in in digital advertising insertion systems resulted from lower costs of certain purchased components and subassemblies for systems  the company achieving certain manufacturing efficiencies as a result of increased volume of systems and design improvements in the second generation video insertion product 
the increase in systems gross profit in movie systems is attributable to company manufacturing and selling a greater number of movie systems  thereby achieving certain manufacturing efficiencies as a result of increased volume of systems 
the decrease in systems gross profit in is attributable to a shift in the mix of system sales and higher manufacturing labor and overhead costs 
the decrease in gross profit of digital advertising insertion systems is primarily attributable to revenues including a greater percentage of smaller scale digital ad insertion systems and expansions to existing systems which have higher costs on certain purchased components and the overall higher manufacturing labor and overhead costs

write off of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of ipc  the company acquired certain technology that can be used with the company s video server technology to provide interactive television network systems to the hospitality and commercial property markets 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recorded a charge to operations of  for the write off of in process research and development  the value of which was determined based upon an independent appraisal 
in addition  the company recorded intangible assets of  that included approximately  of software 
of the acquired technology  the capitalized amount reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the software technology deemed technologically feasible  including the operating system and software for the distribution of movies over the network 
acquired technology  including software to provide certain new interactive features and functions over the network  included in the in process write off reflects the purchase price allocated to technology currently under development and not considered technologically feasible at the time of the acquisition and with no alternative future use 
the company was continuing the development of the software applications and hardware design of this in process development as of december  management estimates the development of this in process development to be completed during and for some features in restructuring of operations 
in march  the company recorded a charge of  for the restructuring of operations as part of a planned consolidation of the operations of sc asia 
the charge for restructuring included  related to the termination of employees  a provision of  related to the planned vacating of premises and  of compensation expense associated with stock options for certain terminated employees

gross profit systems services the company has experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of the company s revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
the company has also experienced significant variations in its quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems so affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  the gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by the company and its competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors may materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of the company s expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through november  the company funded its operations primarily through cash provided by operations and the private sale of equity securities 
in november  in connection with the initial public offering of the company s common stock  the company received net proceeds of million 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from million at december  to million at december  working capital decreased from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities during was the result of the net loss adjusted for noncash expenses including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  inventory valuation allowance and the changes in certain assets and liabilities 
the significant net changes in assets and liabilities that used cash in operations include increases in accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes receivable 
the net increase in accounts receivable in of approximately million is attributable to the increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in the net increase in inventories in of approximately million is principally attributable to the increase in the number of product lines 
income taxes receivable is attributable to the company carrying back the taxable loss in that results in a refund of income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in the year ended december  investment activity consisted primarily of capital expenditures related to the acquisition of computer equipment  office furniture  and other capital equipment required to support the expansion and growth of the business 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately  in the year ended december  in  the cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the initial public offering of the company s common stock in november offset by the purchase of million of treasury stock 
in  the cash used in financing represented repayment of ipc s line of credit of approximately  and payment of loans to related parties of approximately  offset by  received in connection with the issuance common stock pursuant to the both the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
in  the cash provided by financing included million and million borrowings under the equipment line of credit and line of credit  respectively  and by  received in connection with the issuance of common stock pursuant to both the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the company has a million revolving line of credit and a million equipment line of credit with a bank 
the revolving line of credit expires in october and the equipment line of credit expires in june borrowings under the lines of credit are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
loans made under the revolving line of credit generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate plus 
at december  
loans made under the equipment loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate plus at december  
the loan agreement relating to the lines of credit requires that the company provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including the maintenance of total liabilities  excluding deferred revenue  to net worth of at least 
to at december  the company was in compliance with all covenants 
as of december   the company had borrowed million and million against the line of credit and the equipment line of credit  respectively 
the company believes that existing funds together with available borrowings under the line of credit and equipment line facility are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments as of december  year issue year readiness disclosure overview 
the company is completing its process of analyzing and addressing what is known as the year issue 
the year issue has arisen because many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the data field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century and  accordingly  could misconstrue dates such as as the year rather than the failure of computer programs and systems to properly recognize dates beginning in the year could adversely affect the company s business activities 
the company s year compliance program 
the company is executing its year compliance program  the purpose of which is to identify important systems that are not yet year compliant  to initiate replacement or remedial action to assure that key systems will continue to operate in the year and to test the replaced or remediated systems  to identify and contact key suppliers  vendors  customers and business partners to evaluate their ability to maintain normal operations in the year  and to develop appropriate contingency plans for dealing with foreseeable year complications 
the company s year committee has made significant progress toward the completion of these goals 
the committee continues to execute the company s year compliance program and reports the results and status of the company s year efforts to the board of directors 
the company expects to substantially complete its year compliance program activities by the end of information technology systems 
the company s critical internal information technology it systems consist of its electronic mail system  corporate communications system  manufacturing database  desktop and file management systems  software development tools and i s management tools 
the company also uses a call center management software tool for use in the company s customer service department 
the company has contacted the vendors of these systems and obtained assurances that these it systems are currently in material year compliance 
the company continues to upgrade older versions of these systems that may not be compliant and intends to finish these upgrades to achieve material year compliance 
the company is in the process of obtaining written statements confirming such compliance from these vendors 
the company is still in the process of evaluating other areas of its existing internal it systems at this time and will seek further assurances from its vendors as necessary 
the company plans to test its critical it systems during the company intends to evaluate the need for contingency plans for these internal it systems given the assurances of compliance the company has received for these systems 
while the company will work diligently with all of its it system providers  there is no guarantee that these it system providers will meet year compliance 
the failure of any such it system to be year compliant could have a negative effect on the business activities of the company 
non information technology systems 
the company is conducting an assessment of its non information technology systems such as building security  voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors and is in the process of determining the nature and extent of any work that may be required to make any non it systems year compliant 
the company has made year compliance inquiries to the vendors of these systems  and intends to track the responses to its inquiries and have the inquiry process completed during the first half of third party suppliers  vendors and customers 
the company s year compliance program also includes an investigation of the year compliance of its major suppliers  vendors  customers and business partners 
for example  all of the company s products and services incorporate third party software and hardware 
the company is in the process of evaluating its product components 
the company has identified and contacted most of its third party suppliers of hardware and software components regarding year compliance and has collected compliance statements from most of these suppliers 
the company has learned that some features or functions of such third party components are not year compliant 
however  in certain cases the company does not use such features or functions in its products and  to that extent  the company believes the non compliance of such features and functions will not have a negative impact on its products 
in those cases where the non compliance of third party components does affect features or functions used by the company in its products  the company intends to install upgrades most of which are currently available to achieve material compliance 
in addition  the company is completing the process of testing its application software 
to date  the company has found only a few minor problems with its application software  and has already created patches to this software 
given the number of components and the complexity of the software incorporated in the company s products and services  the company believes that in the course of conducting its year compliance program it could reasonably discover that the year problem may affect its software or components 
however  the company regularly develops software updates to its product offerings as a natural course of business and the company does not expect that these year updates will be excessively complex or expensive to implement 
still  there can be no assurances that there will be no service interruption on the part of any of the company s third party suppliers due to the year problem and this could have a material adverse effect on the company 
year costs and expenses 
to date  the costs associated with the year issue and the company s year compliance program have not been material 
the company will incur costs that include internal resources  software and equipment upgrades and replacement 
based on currently available information  the company believes that the expense associated with its ongoing efforts will not be material and will be funded through operations  but the company has not completed its evaluation of its non it systems and its third party relationships 
if unforeseen compliance efforts are required or if present compliance efforts are not completed on time  or if the cost of any required updating  modification or replacement of the company s systems or equipment exceeds the company s estimates  the year issue could result in material costs and have a material adverse effect on the company 
contingency plans 
at the present time  the company has not felt it necessary to formulate any contingency plans for addressing problems due to the year issue 
the company has been assured that its critical internal it systems are compliant by the vendors of those systems and the company will evaluate the need for contingency plans for internal it systems given those assurances 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the year issue with respect to its non it systems and with respect to its major suppliers  vendors  customers and business partners 
as this evaluation process proceeds  the company will formulate appropriate contingency plans 
the company expects that any required contingency planning will be completed no later than the end of risks associated with year issue 
various statements in this discussion of year are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of as discussed above under factors that may affect future results 
these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include the inability of the company to complete the plans and modifications that it has identified  the failure of software vendors to deliver the upgrades and repairs to which they have committed  the wide variety of information technology systems and components  both hardware and software  that must be evaluated  any inaccuracy in the assessment of the cost and financial exposure of the company with respect to current and older versions of the company s products  the failure of software vendors to deliver upgrades and repairs to which they have committed  and the large number of vendors and customers with which the company interacts 
the company s assessments of the effects of year on the company are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and the company s reasonable reliance on that information 
therefore  the risk that inaccurate information is supplied by third parties upon which the company reasonably relied must be considered as a risk factor that might affect the company s year efforts 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests 
effects of inflation management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  the company has not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at december   the company had  outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated shor term debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  interest expense on these short term borrowings would increase by  the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
the company s cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which the company considers investments to be purchased with original maturities of three months or less given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
as a result  the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures
