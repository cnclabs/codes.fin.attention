the company adopted sfas as of january  sfas no 
requires companies to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
this statement also requires that public companies report certain information about their products and services  the geographic areas in which they operate and their major customers 
the company adopted sfas as of december  overview the company s net loss for was  and its loss attributable to common stockholders was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  the net loss is primarily attributable to increased expenses generated by the company s technology segment 
the difference between the net loss and the loss attributable to common stockholders resulted from preferred stock dividends  accretion  premiums on repurchases and the conversion discount on preferred stock 
on march   the company received million from the sale of  shares of common stock 
the purchasers also received a total of  warrants to purchase common stock for a period of five years at each  the closing price of the common stock on march  see management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources financings 
on december   the company sold its mec and lsia subsidiaries to vision in a transaction effective as of december  under the company s ownership  mec was a vision managed care company which managed vision care programs for health maintenance organizations hmos and other insured enrollees and lsia was a physician practice management company which managed the ophthalmic practice known as nnjei under a management services agreement

the improvement in technology related revenues can be primarily attributed to increased sales of the company s newer laserscan lsx excimer laser system during at a higher average selling price  resulting in  of the total revenue increase 
the average system selling price increased by approximately percent from levels 
fifty laser systems were sold during compared to forty six systems being sold in of these total system sales  thirty laserscan lsx models were sold in compared to nine laserscan lsx models being sold in other contributing factors leading to the increase in technology related revenues were a higher level of service contract revenues  and revenues generated from the company s aesthetic product line 
patent related revenues also increased by  more than offsetting the increases in technology and patent revenues were decreases in health care services revenues  which was attributable to the sale of mec and lsia effective december  these two subsidiaries contributed  and  respectively  in revenues during the year ended all of the compan s health care services revenue was generated by tfg during net sales for tfg for the year ended decreased by  from the same period in this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in consulting services provided and was accompanied by a total expense reduction  including cost of services  of  for the year ended such revenue and expense decreases are primarily the result of further staffing reductions during to more closely match their cost structure with anticipated revenues going forward 
vs 
the increase in health care services revenue was primarily attributable to increased revenues generated by mec an increase of  and lsia an increase of  offset by a substantial reduction in revenues generated by tfg 
of the total net sales and revenues for  mec  lsia and tfg accounted for revenues of  of total revenues   and   respectively 
net sales for tfg for the year ended decreased by  from the same period in this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in consulting services provided and was accompanied by a total expense reduction  including costs of services  of  for the year ended such revenue decrease is primarily a result of that subsidiary s primary revenue producer  michael r 
farris  being named as president of the company in late  eliminating his day to day participation in the consulting business 
other consultants employed were unable to maintain revenues at historical levels 
the increase in revenues generated by mec resulted from new contracts entered into during and increased enrollments in existing contracts 
the increase in revenues generated by lsia in is primarily a result of lsia being acquired in july the increase in revenues generated by the company s technology subsidiary is primarily attributable to the phasing out of the ls laser system which had a lower selling price than the laserscan and laserscan lsx 
forty six laser systems were sold during compared to systems  net of returns  sold in technology revenues include the impact of sales returns in and one system return in the financial impact of systems sold in and returned in in excess of previously estimated amounts was approximately million  broken down as follows net revenues were decreased by million  offset by reductions in corresponding cost of sales million and commissions and warranty related costs million

the gross profit margin percentage increase was primarily attributable to the sale of mec and lsia effective december  mec and lsia operated at gross margins of and for the year ended  respectively 
an additional contributing factor leading to the improvement in the gross profit on products was a higher level of laserscan lsx laser system sales 
vs 
the gross profit margin decrease was attributable to a significant increase in mec revenues with a corresponding increase in provider payments  which historically have ranged from approximately to of mec revenues  and a general increase in the operating costs of the company s costa rican manufacturing facility due to the doubling of leased space and higher than average compensation increases paid to costa rican employees due to the competitive environment for engineers in that area  the costs of which are allocated entirely to cost of goods sold 
the gross profit margin decrease was mitigated in part due to a substantial increase in revenues generated by lsia 
research  development and regulatory expenses 
the following table presents a three year comparative analysis of research  development and regulatory expenses 
change change research  development and regulatory    as a percent of technology net sales research  development and regulatory expenses increased by  between and such expenses increased by  between and vs 
the increase can be primarily attributed to continued development and validation of the keratome product line and the development of a new mobile scanning refractive laser system  partially offset by a decrease in costs relating to the continued development of the laserscan lsx  which was substantially completed during additionally  the company incurred minor increases in costs related to the fda regulatory approval process  both for its own scanning laser system and the lasik laser system 
in  approximately million was incurred in the development of and clinical and manufacturing validation of the unishaper single use keratome compared to  in during  the company began a project to develop a mobile platform for an excimer laser system and incurred approximately  in related costs 
expenses related to the development of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system decreased approximately  from levels to approximately  in as a result of a continuation of the efforts described plus the anticipated development of new product ideas  the company expects research and development expense during to remain at levels consistent with those incurred during regulatory expenses may increase as a result of the company s continued pursuit of fda approval  protocols added during and related to the potential use of the company s laser systems for treatment of glaucoma and lasik and the possible development of additional future protocols for submission to the fda 
vs 
the increase can primarily be attributed to ongoing research and development of new scanning refractive laser systems  including development of the laserscan lsx and add on features for the laserscan  and continued software development for the laser systems 
additionally  the company incurred increased costs related to the fda regulatory process  both for its own scanning laser system the pma application for which was filed in march  and the lasik laser system for which the company purchased the rights to manufacture and commercialize if fda approval is received 
additional costs were incurred in the clinical and manufacturing validation of the unishaper

the primary reason for this decrease was attributable to the sale of mec and lsia effective december  mec and lsia incurred  and  respectively  in other general and administrative costs during an additional factor resulting in this decrease was the reduction in the operating costs of tfg of  from levels 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses incurred at the company s technology subsidiary of  from levels 
in addition  bad debt expense decreased  from these decreases were partially offset by strategic initiatives of the company and the development of it products and services 
such strategic efforts included enhancements to the customer support  quality assurance  marketing  software development and engineering departments  costs of the aesthetic laser product line acquired in april  higher depreciation and lease costs including a larger facility in florida  legal expenses  and patent related expenses  which were nominal during legal and accounting expenditures continue to be incurred as a result of ongoing regulatory filings  general corporate issues  litigation and patent issues

liquidity and capital resources working capital 
working capital increased  from  in to  in this increase resulted primarily from a reduction in liabilities 
sources and uses of funds 
operating activities used net cash of  in  compared to  used in and  used in the increase is primarily attributable to the higher net loss as compared to the net loss in and the sale of mec and lsia  both of which generated income in other factors contributing to the higher level of cash used in operating activities were increases in notes and accounts receivable  and inventory  and decreases in income taxes payable  partially offset by the provision for uncollectible accounts  and by increases in depreciation and amortization costs  accrued expenses  and deferred revenues  from the licensing of certain patents 
the company s receivable turnover ratio for  using technology revenues and receivables  was compared to in this improvement can be primarily attributed to generally improved terms of sales in such terms also contributed to the reduction in the provision for uncollectible accounts 
of the company s gross receivables at december   approximately are considered past due compared to approximately at december  the company s inventory turnover ratio for  excluding aesthetic related inventory acquired in april  was compared to in this decrease can be attributed to an increase in inventory from levels and lower than anticipated system sales in the fourth quarter of net cash provided by investing activities in was  compared to  of net cash used in investing activities during and  of net cash provided in net cash provided by investing activities during can be primarily attributed to proceeds generated from the exclusive licensing of patents  and from the sale of vision common stock resulting from the company s sale of mec and lsia  partially offset by the acquisition of the lasik pmk application  and the purchase of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in investing activities during can be primarily attributed to the acquisition of certain patent rights and license agreements from ibm and others  the purchase of office and computer equipment  and the purchase of a vision managed care contract  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of two of the company s subsidiaries  and proceeds from the exclusive licensure of such patents 
net cash provided by investing activities in can be primarily attributed to the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction  offset by the acquisition of the assets of nnjei  and the purchase of office and computer equipment and leasehold improvements

the company used such funds to pay the repurchase price of  including a premium 
the company believes that without the consent of the preferred shareholders  the transaction would not have been completed 
in addition  the company believes that the repurchase reduced the dilutive effect of the series b preferred stock on the company s common shareholders 
working capital requirements 
the company experienced a significant negative cash flow from operations in  largely resulting from fewer laser system sales and the increase in research  development and regulatory expenses resulting from the development of the laserscan lsx and other efforts as previously described 
we expect that any improvements in cash flow from operations will depend on  among other things  our ability to market  produce and sell our new laserscan lsx laser systems in larger quantities and our ability to market  produce and sell our keratome related products on a commercial basis 
during  laserscan lsx laser system sales accounted for the majority of laser systems sold  and we expect sales of our laserscan lsx laser system to make a more significant contribution to our operating results in the future 
we are finalizing the clinical validation of our unishaper single use keratome product  and believe that regular commercial shipments of that product will begin in the second quarter of with our million financing that closed in march  we believe that our balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with our cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital requirements through in accordance with our current business plan 
our belief regarding future working capital requirements is based on various factors and assumptions including the anticipated timely entry into the international marketplace with keratome related products and the us market with both our keratome related products and laserscan lsx system  the anticipated timely collection of receivables including faster anticipated collections and the lack of extended payment terms on keratome related products  and the absence of unanticipated product development costs 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not collect a material portion of current receivables in a timely manner  experience significant further delays in the shipment of our unishaper single use keratome product or in the fda clearance and entry into the us market of our laserscan lsx laser system  or experience less market demand for our products than we anticipate  our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will not seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future to the extent required or that  if available  it will be on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the terms of the new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  the terms of the debt could require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest and may render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
the company expects cash flow from operations to show improvement during as a result of the expected shipment of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and unishaper single use keratomes as previously discussed 
however  the company expects to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow from operations for the first quarter of there can be no assurance that the company can regain or sustain profitability or positive operative cash flow in any subsequent fiscal period 
the company may from time to time reassess its credit policy and the terms it will make available to individual customers 
there can be no assurance as to the terms or amount of third party financing  if any  that the company s customers may obtain in the future 
the company is placing greater emphasis on the terms and collection timing of future sales 
the company expects to begin commercial shipment of its keratome products  increase the level of manufacturing and distribution of its laser systems and to continue a variety of research and development activities on its excimer and solid state laser systems over the next twelve months and it is anticipated that such keratome  research and development and regulatory efforts in the us will be the most significant technology related expenses in the foreseeable future 
possible joint ventures 
the company is receptive to joint venture discussions with compatible companies for the development and operation in international markets of surgical centers that will utilize the company s products 
the company has no present commitments for joint venture relationships  and no assurance can be given that any such relationships will be secured on terms satisfactory to the company 
risk factors and uncertainties the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company and the market price of the common stock may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including the ones noted below industry and competition risks we may encounter difficulties competing in the highly competitive vision correction industry 
the vision correction industry is subject to intense  increasing competition  and we do not know if we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
many of our competitors have existing products and distribution systems in the marketplace and are substantially larger  better financed  and better known 
two of our principal competitors  summit technology  inc and autonomous technology corporation  recently entered into a merger agreement 
if the proposed merger is approved by stockholders  it is anticipated that the merger would be completed during the first quarter of if completed  the market presence  technology base and distribution capabilities of the combined entity would be substantial 
further  the merger would provide autonomous with licenses to use certain patents owned by visx  inc our competitors may have or receive broader regulatory approvals which may prevent us from marketing our products 
we have not yet received the gmp clearance from the fda that is required for the commercial sale of our laserscan lsx laser system 
based on the current status of development efforts  we believe that it is reasonable to expect such fda clearance in the next four to seven months 
however  we cannot be certain as to the receipt or the timing of receipt of such clearance 
a number of lasers manufactured by other companies have either received  or are in the process of receiving  fda approval for specific procedures  and  accordingly  may have or develop a higher level of acceptance in some markets than our lasers 
in addition to laser systems of summit technology  inc  visx  inc 
and others already approved for commercial sale in the us  nidek co  ltd 
obtained fda approval of its ec excimer laser system in december other manufacturers  including bausch lomb  are expected to obtain approval during  giving them the right to market their systems commercially in the us the established market presence in the us of previously approved laser systems  as well as the entry of new competitors into the market upon receipt of regulatory approvals  could impede our ability to successfully introduce our laserscan lsx system and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products or technolgies could erode demand for our products or make them obsolete 
in addition to competing with eyeglasses  contact lenses and rk  excimer laser vision correction competes or may compete with newer technologies such as intraocular lenses  corneal rings and surgical techniques using different types of lasers 
to date  we have not been materially affected by the introduction of new or advanced technologies in the laser vision correction industry 
two products that may become competitive within the next one to three years are intraocular lenses and corneal rings 
both of these procedures involve lens implants that require an invasive surgical procedure  unlike an excimer laser  and their ultimate market acceptance is unknown at this time 
to the extent that any of these or other new technologies are perceived to be clinically superior or economically more attractive than excimer laser vision correction  they could erode demand for our excimer laser products  cause a reduction in selling prices of such products or render such products obsolete 
in addition  if one or more competing technologies achieve broader market acceptance or render our prk and lasik lasers procedures obsolete  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we do not anticipate that additional technical difficulties will arise that would further delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of our unishaper single use keratome product  we cannot be certain that new difficulties will not arise 
unanticipated logistical issues  such as the manufacturer s failure to meet expected production goals  may arise which could further delay the commercialization of the product 
as is typical in the case of new and rapidly evolving industries  demand and market for recently introduced technology and products is uncertain  and we cannot be certain that our unishaper single use product or future new products and enhancements will be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  announcements of new products  whether for sale in the near future or at some later date  may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products 
the lack of broad market acceptance of laser based eye treatment may have an adverse effect on our business 
we believe that whether we achieve profitability and growth will depend  in part  upon broad acceptance of prk or lasik in the us and other countries 
we cannot be certain that prk or lasik will be accepted by either the ophthalmologists or the public as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
the acceptance of prk and lasik may be adversely affected by o the cost of the procedure o possible concerns relating to safety and efficacy o the public s general resistance to surgery o the effectiveness and lower cost of alternative methods of correcting refractive vision disorders o the lack of long term follow up data o the possibility of unknown side effects o the lack of third party reimbursement for the procedures o possible future unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes from the use of prk or lasik systems o the possible shortages of ophthalmologists trained in the procedures 
the failure of prk or lasik to achieve broad market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
financial and liquidity risks we have experienced and may continue to experience losses and operating cash flow deficits 
we experienced significant net losses and deficits in cash flow from operations for the fiscal years ended december   and  as set forth in the following table 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to regain or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow 
for the twelve month period ended december  net loss million million million deficit in cash flow from operations million million million although we achieved profitability during and  we had a deficit in cash flow from operations of million during in addition  we incurred losses in through as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to report a loss and deficit in cash flow from operations for the first quarter of if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses 
although we monitor the status of our receivables and maintain a reserve for estimated losses  we cannot be certain that our reserves for estimated losses  which was approximately million at december   will be sufficient to cover the amount of our actual write offs over time 
at december   our trade accounts and notes receivable totaled approximately million  and accrued commissions  the payment of which generally depends on the collection of such net trade accounts and notes receivable  totaled approximately million 
actual write offs that materially exceed amounts reserved could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of any loss that we may have to recognize in connection with our inability to collect receivables is principally dependent on our customer s ongoing financial condition  their ability to generate revenues from our laser systems  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against delinquent customers 
approximately of our net receivables at december  related to international accounts 
our ability to evaluate the financial condition and revenue generating ability of our prospective customers located outside of the united states  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against non us customers  is generally more limited than for our customers located in the us see company and business risks we are subject to certain risks associated with our international sales 
if we experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms  we may experience liquidity problems 
at december   we had extended the original payment terms of laser customer accounts totaling approximately  by periods ranging from to months 
such restructured receivables represent approximately percent of our net receivables as of that date 
our liquidity and operating cash flow would be adversely affected if additional extensions become necessary in the future 
in addition  it may be more difficult to collect laser system receivables if the payment schedule extends beyond the expected or actual economic life of the system  which we estimate to be approximately five to seven years 
to date  we do not believe any payment schedules extend beyond the economic life of the applicable systems 
we may experience liquidity problems and there is uncertainty regarding the terms or availability of additional capital 
during the year ended december   we experienced a million deficit in cash flow from operations 
we expect that any improvements in cash flow from operations will depend on  among other things  our ability to market  produce and sell our new laserscan lsx laser systems in larger quantities and our ability to market  produce and sell our unishaper single use keratome product on a commercial basis 
during the fourth quarter of  laserscan lsx laser system sales accounted for the majority of laser systems sold  and we expect sales of our laserscan lsx laser system to make a more significant contribution to our operating results in the future 
because we are still in the process of completing the clinical validation of our unishaper single use keratome product  we do not believe that regular commercial shipments of that product will begin until the second quarter of with our financing that closed in march  we believe that our balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with our cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital requirements for the next months in accordance with our current business plan 
our belief regarding future working capital requirements is based on various factors and assumptions including the anticipated timely entry into the international marketplace with keratome related products and the us market with both our keratome related products and laserscan lsx system  the anticipated timely collection of receivables including faster anticipated collections and the lack of extended payment terms on keratome related products  and the absence of unanticipated product development costs 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not collect a material portion of current receivables in a timely manner  experience significant further delays in the shipment of our unishaper single use keratome product or in the fda clearance and entry into the us market of our laserscan lsx laser system  or experience less market demand for our products than we anticipate  our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that we will not seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future to the extent required or that  if available  it will be on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the terms of the new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  the terms of the debt could require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest and may render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
common stock risks the market price of our common stock may continue to experience extreme fluctuations due to market conditions that are unrelated to our operating performance 
the volatility of our common stock imposes a greater risk of capital losses on stockholders as compared to less volatile stocks 
in addition  such volatility makes it difficult to ascribe a stable valuation to a stockholder s holdings of lasersight common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by lasersight or its competitors  changes in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory approval processes  developments or disputes relating to patent or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of the procedures for which the laser system is used  and changes in reports and recommendations of security analysts  have and may continue to have a significant impact on the market price of lasersight common stock 
moreover  the possibility exists that the stock market  and in particular the securities of technology companies such as lasersight  could experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to operating performance 
variations in our sales and operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  we have historically operated with little or no backlog because our products are generally shipped as orders are received  and a significant portion of orders for a particular quarter have been received and shipped near the end of the quarter 
as a result  our operating results for any quarter often depend on orders received and laser systems shipped late in that quarter 
other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include o timing of regulatory approvals and the introduction of new products  o reductions  cancellations or fulfillment of major orders  o the addition or loss of significant customers  o our relative mix of business  o changes in pricing by us or our competitors  o changes in personnel and employee utilization rates  o costs related to expansion of our business  o increased competition  and o budget decisions by our customers 
as a result of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results cannot necessarily be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in some quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
the significant number of shares eligible for future sale and dilutive stock issuances may adversely affect our stock price 
sales  or the possibility of sales  of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of march   of lasersight s  shares of common stock outstanding  approximately million shares were freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act  except to the extent such shares are held by affiliates of lasersight as that term is defined in rule under securities act or subject only to the satisfaction of a prospectus delivery requirement 
shares included in the march private placement will be freely tradable on a similar basis once a registration statement covering such shares is filed and declared effective 
shares of common stock which lasersight may issue in connection with future acquisitions or financings or pursuant to outstanding warrants or agreements could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause significant dilution in our earnings per share and net book value per share 
o we may be required to issue more than million additional shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and to satisfy certain contingent contractual obligations 
see market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters 
o in addition  the million outstanding shares of series c and series d preferred stock may be converted into common stock at any time 
see market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters 
o the anti dilution provisions of certain of our existing securities and obligations require us to issue additional shares if we issue shares of common stock below specified price levels 
if a future share issuance triggers these adjustments  the beneficiaries of such provisions effectively receive some protection from declines in the market price of our common stock  while our other stockholders incur additional dilution of their ownership interest 
we may include similar anti dilution provisions in securities issued in connection with future financings 
some of the factors we consider when we determine whether to include such provisions are our cash resources  the trading history of our common stock  the negotiating position of the selling party or the investors  and the extent to which we estimate that the expected benefit from the acquisition or financing exceeds the expected dilutive effect of the price protection provision 
certain anti takeover measures may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors  discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay  defer or prevent a change in control of lasersight  even if such events could be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder action 
lasersight also is subject to provisions of delaware corporation law that prohibit a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or more of the corporation s common stock an interested stockholder for three years after the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights agreement and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right right on each outstanding share of common stock 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire or more of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
company and business risks we depend on our key personnel for our future success 
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends in part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key employees  especially michael r 
farris  our president and chief executive officer  and j 
richard crowley  the president and chief operating officer of our lasersight technologies subsidiary 
a loss of one or more such officers or key employees  especially of mr 
farris or mr 
crowley  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not carry key man insurance on mr 
farris  mr 
crowley or any other officers or key employees 
as we continue the clinical development of our excimer lasers and other products and prepare for regulatory approvals and other commercialization activities  we will need to continue to implement and expand our operational  financial and management resources and controls 
while to date we haven t experienced problems recruiting or retaining the personnel necessary to implement such actions  we cannot be certain that such problems won t arise in the future 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals for necessary positions  and if we are unable to effectively manage growth in our domestic and international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure of our yk compliance efforts  lack of compliance by our material suppliers and other uncertainties related to the yk issue could adversely affect our business 
as many computer systems  software programs and other equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  they may be unable to process accurately certain data  during or after the year as a result  lasersight as well as other business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures which could cause material disruptions in business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
the yk issue concerns not only information systems and technology used by lasersight  but also concerns third parties  such as our customers  vendors and distributors  using information systems and technology that may interact with or affect our operations 
we have implemented a yk readiness program with the objective of having all of our significant information systems and technology functioning properly with respect to yk before january  we have developed a comprehensive plan to assess the actual and potential yk impact on our operations  both in information technology it areas and non information technology non it areas  as well as our product offerings 
our assessment included our manufacturing and operating systems and the readiness of vendors and other third parties upon whom we rely 
o it systems 
our it systems are microcomputer based and consist of standard software purchased from outside vendors 
all software is being identified and assessed to determine the extent of modification required in order to be yk compliant 
we believe that all software will be made yk compliant before the end of june through vendor provided updates or replacement with other yk compliant hardware and software 
we  as has been planned for some time  are also replacing our financial and accounting software  and expect to have the majority of such new software implemented in the second quarter of the vendors of our financial and accounting software have represented to us that the software is yk compliant 
our it inventory related to yk compliance is approximately complete  the remediation assessment of problem areas is approximately complete  and testing  including validation of compliance  is expected to be completed by the end of april o non it systems 
for our non it systems  we have identified third parties with which we have a significant relationship that  in the event of a yk failure  could have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the third parties include utility suppliers  material and supply vendors  communication vendors and our significant distributors 
some of these relationships  especially those associated with certain suppliers  are material to us and a yk failure by one or more of these parties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are corresponding with these business partners and service providers to assess their ability to support our operations with respect to each of their yk issues 
the issues that are identified as part of this process are being prioritized in order of significance to our operations and we will take corrective action as appropriate 
we have contacted approximately of our vendors  business partners and service providers 
approximately have responded to date  and we are continuing to assess their responses 
o products 
we are not aware of any yk problems with our current production model  the laserscan lsx  as all applicable components and the software have been validated and tested 
older models  generally manufactured in the first half of and earlier  may require upgraded software and or hardware 
we are taking steps to promptly notify affected users and  except for those users under warranty or service contract  offer such upgrades at additional cost to the user 
such upgrades are currently available and  in addition to resolving potential yk problems  also provide for more efficient system performance 
we intend to develop contingency plans for yk issues which  if not timely resolved  could have a significant impact on our operations 
these plans will be designed to minimize the impact of failure to achieve yk compliance 
such contingency plans are substantially complete although we will continue to monitor our plans as a result of future events and circumstances 
we estimate the costs to address yk issues will total  of which approximately  has been incurred to date 
such costs will be expensed as incurred  and will exclude the costs of our new financial and accounting software 
yk compliance related costs are estimated to be of our total it expense budget through the end of no material it projects are expected to be delayed 
the costs and time necessary to complete the yk modification and testing processes are based on our best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
our yk readiness program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various components of the yk readiness program described above are subject to change 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in our yk compliance  mainly resulting from our dependence upon the yk compliance of the government agencies  suppliers  vendors and distributors with whom we and our service providers deal  we are unable to determine at this time our most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
while we expect our yk compliance efforts to reduce significantly our level of uncertainty about the impact of yk issues affecting it and non it systems and our product offerings  we cannot be certain that costs related to the lack of yk compliance of third parties  business interruptions  litigation and other liabilities related to yk issues will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation and regulatory decisions may restrict or delay the manufacture and marketing of our products 
our laser products are subject to strict governmental regulations which materially affect our ability to manufacture and market these products and directly impact our overall prospects 
all laser devices marketed in interstate commerce are subject to the laser regulations required by the radiation control for health and safety act  as administered by the fda 
the regulations impose design and performance standards  labeling and reporting requirements  and submission conditions in advance of marketing for all medical laser products 
our ophthalmic laser systems produced for medical use require pma approval by the fda before we can ship our laser systems for use in the us each separate medical device requires a separate fda submission  and specific protocols have to be submitted to the fda for each claim made for each medical device 
if and when our ophthalmic laser systems receive pma approval by the fda  we will be required to obtain gmp clearance with respect to our manufacturing facilities 
these regulations impose certain procedural and documentation requirements with respect to our manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
our facilities will be subject to inspections by the fda  and if any noncompliance with gmp guidelines is noted during facility inspections  the marketing of our laser products may be adversely affected 
in addition  if any of our suppliers of significant components or sub assemblies cannot meet our quality requirements  we could be delayed in producing commercial systems for the us market 
additionally  product and procedure labeling and all forms of promotional activities are subject to examination by the fda  and current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
noncompliance with these requirements may result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  recall or seizure of products  suspension of manufacturing  denial or withdrawal of pmas  and criminal prosecution 
laser products marketed in foreign countries are often subject to local laws governing health product development processes which may impose additional costs for overseas product development 
in particular  all member countries of the eu require ce mark certification of compliance with the eu medical directives as the standard for regulatory approval for sale of laser systems in eu member countries 
both of our laserscan lsx and laserscan laser systems have received ce mark certification  the former of which was received in september we cannot determine the costs or time it will take to complete the approval process and the related clinical testing for our medical laser products 
future legislative or administrative requirements  in the us  or elsewhere  may adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain regulatory approval for our laser products 
the failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
patent infringement allegations may impair our ability to manufacture and market our products 
there are a number of us and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery that we do not own or have the right to use 
if we were found to infringe a patent in a particular market  lasersight and its customers may be enjoined from making  using and selling that product in the market and be liable for damages for any past infringement of such rights 
in order to continue using such rights  we would be required to obtain a license which may require us to make royalty  per procedure or other fee payments 
we cannot be certain if we or our customers will be successful in securing licenses  or that if we obtain licenses  such licenses will be on acceptable terms 
alternatively  we might be required to redesign the infringing aspects of these products 
any redesign efforts that we undertake could be expensive and might require regulatory review 
furthermore  the redesign efforts could delay the reintroduction of these products into certain markets  or may be so significant as to be impractical 
if redesign efforts were impractical  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling the infringing products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial and results of operations 
while we are not currently involved in any material patent litigation  we have been the subject of patent infringement allegations in the past and such allegations are common in our industry 
in  summit and visx formed a us partnership  pillar point partners  to pool certain of their patents related to corneal sculpting technologies 
as part of their agreement to dissolve pillar point in june  summit and visx granted each other a worldwide  royalty free cross license whereby each party will have full rights to license all existing patents owned by either company relating to laser vision correction for use with their systems 
in connection with our march settlement of litigation with pillar point regarding alleged infringement by our lasers of certain us patents  we agreed to notify pillar point before we begin manufacturing or selling our laser systems in the us while we are not contractually obligated to anyone to obtain a license prior to the selling our lasers in the us  one or more of our competitors may assert that such a license is required 
as of the date of this prospectus  we have not obtained a us license from either summit or visx  and the terms of any license  if such license is granted  have not been determined 
required minimum payments under our unishaper license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our unishaper product 
in addition to the risk that the unishaper single use keratome will not be accepted in the marketplace  we are required to make certain minimum payments to the licensors under our unishaper single use keratome limited exclusive license agreement 
under the agreement  we are required to pay a total of  in two installments due six and months after the date of our receipt of completed limited production molds and to provide an excimer laser 
we provided the laser during the quarter ended june   and we expect to accept and receive such molds once we determine that the product is ready to be commercially shipped 
we currently anticipate regular commercial shipments to commence in the second quarter of in addition  commencing seven months after such date  we will be required to make royalty payments equal to of our defined gross profits from unishaper single use keratome sales  with a minimum royalty of  per calendar quarter for a period of eight quarters 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our international sales 
our international sales accounted for of our total revenues during the year ended december  we expect sales to international accounts will continue to represent a comparable percentage of our total sales unless and until our systems are cleared for commercial distribution in the us  or with respect to those products that do not require regulatory approval  otherwise enter the us market 
the majority of our international sales for the twelve months ended december  were to customers in canada  china  brazil  mexico  italy  argentina  south africa  and turkey 
our business  financial condition and international results of operations may be adversely affected by present economic instability in brazil and the impact of that instability on other south american countries  future economic instability in other countries in which we have sold or may sell  increases in duty rates  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  ability to maintain or increase prices  and competition 
in addition  international sales may be limited or disrupted by o the imposition of government controls o export license requirements o political instability o trade restrictions o changes in tariffs o difficulties in staffing and coordinating communications among and managing international operations 
because all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars  we do not have exposure to typical foreign currency fluctuation risk 
however  due to our significant export sales  we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the effective price in local currencies of our products 
this could in turn result in reduced sales  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting receivables 
see if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses above 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations as a result of such regulatory  political and other factors  such factors may have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future or require us to modify our business practices 
inadequacy or unavailability of insurance may expose us to substantial product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development  testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices for human use 
we have agreed in the past  and we will likely agree in the future  to indemnify certain medical institutions and personnel who conduct and participate in our clinical studies 
while we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that any such liability will be covered by our insurance or that damages will not exceed the limits of our coverage 
even if a claim is covered by insurance  the costs of defending a product liability  malpractice  negligence or other action  and the assessment of damages in excess of insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our claims made product liability insurance coverage is limited to million and our general liability insurance coverage is limited to million  including up to million of coverage under an excess liability policy 
further  product liability insurance may not continue to be available  either at existing or increased levels of coverage  on commercially reasonable terms 
our supply of certain critical components and systems may be interrupted because of our reliance on a limited number of suppliers 
lasersight currently purchases certain components used in the production  operation and maintenance of its laser systems and related products from a limited number of suppliers and certain key components are provided by a single vendor 
any interruption in the supply of critical laser components could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the unishaper single use keratome product will be manufactured exclusively for lasersight by frantz medical development ltd  an iso company experienced in the manufacture of engineering grade medical devices 
we also have exclusive supply arrangements for certain key laser system components with tui lasertechnik und laserintegration gmbh 
if any of our key suppliers cease providing us with products of acceptable quality and quantity in a timely fashion  we would have to locate and contract with a substitute supplier 
we do not know if such substitute suppliers could be located and qualified in a timely manner or could provide required products on commercially reasonable terms 
acquisition risks past and possible futute acquisitions that are not successfully integrated with our existing operations may adversely affect our business 
we have made several significant acquisitions since  including the farris group in  photomed in and  ibm patents in august and our acquisition of certain assets of seo medical in april although we are currently focusing on our existing operations  we may in the future selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in  or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances with  companies whose business or technology complement our business 
we may not be able to identify suitable candidates to acquire or enter into joint ventures or other arrangements with or we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms for such activities 
in addition  with respect to our recent acquisitions as well as any future transactions  we could have difficulty assimilating the personnel  technology and operations of the acquired company  which would prevent us from realizing expected synergies  and may incur unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
this could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and other resources 
we cannot be certain that we would succeed in overcoming these risks or any other problems in connection with any acquisitions we may make or joint ventures or arrangements we may enter into 
amortization and charges relating to our significant intangible assets could adversely affect our stock price and reported net income or loss 
goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the difference between the total purchase price of the acquisitions and the amount of such purchase price allocated to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized over a period of time  with the amount amortized in a particular period constituting a non cash expense that reduces our net income or increases our net loss 
of our total assets at december   approximately million or were intangible assets 
the following table presents an overview of our significant intangible assets and goodwill at december  value of assets amortization period goodwill million years cost of patents million years acquired licenses and technology million months years a reduction in net income resulting from the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets may have an adverse impact upon the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the event of a sale or liquidation of lasersight or our assets  we cannot be certain that the value of such intangible assets would be recovered 
in accordance with sfas  we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  including a history of operating or cash flow losses  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a noncash impairment charge would be recognized 
we continue to assess the current results and future prospects of tfg in view of the substantial reduction in the subsidiary s operating results in and tfg s operating results have improved in when compared to and if tfg is unsuccessful in continuing to improve its financial performance  some or all of the carrying amount of goodwill recorded  million at december   may be subject to an impairment adjustment 
other risks the risks described above under are not the only risks facing lasersight 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we have deemed immaterial which could also negatively impact our business operations 
if any of the foregoing risks actually occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its exposure to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates is not significant 
the company s investments are limited to highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less 
at december   the company had less than million of short term investments classified as cash and equivalents 
all of the company s transactions with international customers and suppliers are denominated in us dollars
