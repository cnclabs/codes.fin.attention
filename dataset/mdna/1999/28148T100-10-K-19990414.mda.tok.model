the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
net income per share computations for each quarter are independent of the year end computations

the company s quarterly gross profit margins have fluctuated as a result of such factors as customer and product mix 
products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly the company has historically operated with little backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed and are budgeted based primarily on the company s annual sales forecast 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company s working capital needs have been met through funds generated from operations and from the company s revolving line of credit 
the company s principal need for working capital has been to meet peak inventory and accounts receivable requirements associated with its seasonal sales pattern 
the company increases inventory levels during the spring and summer months in anticipation of increasing shipments in the late summer and fall 
accounts receivable typically increase during the summer and fall because of the company s use of extended payment programs  wherein sales are made to the company s customers for which payment is deferred for one to three months based on the size of the sales orders 
due to said sales patterns  the largest customer orders are shipped during the summer and fall  hence increasing accounts receivable balances during the third and fourth quarters 
net cash used by operating activities was million in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in this million increase in the use of cash by operations was primarily due to the net loss of million in compared to the net income of million in a decrease of million in accounts receivable was largely off set by the million decrease in accounts payable 
in  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a combination of two factors 
first  inventory levels only increased by million in versus increasing by million in due primarily to a lower growth rate of exploratoy inventory in 
second  income taxes receivable of million was received in  however  income taxes of million were paid in additionally  cash was provided in by the reduction of other assets by million from million in to million in this reduction was primarily the result of the collection of the long term receivable established pursuant to the affiliated label sales program for the company s cd rom products 
this program was terminated in resulting in the company receiving full payment of said receivable earlier than originally anticipated 
financing activities provided cash of million in compared to cash used of million in this was principally due to the million increase in the line of credit outstanding at december  necessary to fund operating losses and capital expenditures as compared to the decrease in the line of credit outstanding experienced in financing activities used million of cash in compared to cash provided of million in this was principally due to the million decrease in the line of credit outstanding at december  compared to the increase in the line of credit experienced in necessary to fund the inventory growth during the company currently has a revolving line of credit with a bank  which is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
under the revolving line of credit agreement  which expires june   the company may borrow up to million 
the agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  minimum annual net income amounts and tangible net worth amounts  and provides for various restrictions including limitations on capital expenditures and additional indebtedness 
as of december   the company had obtained waivers for violations of certain financial ratio and annual net income covenants relating to the loan agreement 
however  due to the nature of the debt coverage ratio  the company would have been in violation of that loan covenant during the first three quarters of making the company s long term debt potentially callable 
as such  the bank subsequently amended the loan agreement to waive said covenant until december  the company had outstanding borrowings of million and million under its line of credit at december  and  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in the company anticipates that capital expenditures will be less than million with these expenditures primarily in the areas of new product tooling 
the company believes that borrowings available under the revolving line of credit and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
the company has an outstanding commitment in conjunction with the lease of its tennessee warehouse facility 
in  a shareholder who is also a director of the company entered into a loan agreement with the industrial development board of maury county  tennessee  for industrial development revenue bonds series  in the amount of  at interest per annum  to construct a building being leased to the company 
the company has guaranteed the loan with the industrial development board of maury county  tennessee 
should the shareholder default on said loan the company would be required to make the applicable loan payments but would offset such payments against the lease payments due to said shareholder 
year update the company is continuing the process of addressing the year problem with an overall goal of ensuring that its critical systems  devices and business applications are suitable for continued use beyond the company has completed its assessment phase wherein all of its hardware and software systems and all of the embedded systems contained in the company s buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure have been assessed as to whether they will consistently and properly recognize the year the business accounting software and hardware  as well as certain warehouse management software are believed to be the company s only critical systems with respect to which the year problem is known to exist 
the company is using primarily external resources to reprogram or replace and test this software and hardware for year compliance 
with respect to the business accounting software and hardware  the company completed this phase by the end of the upgrade or replacement of other critical and non critical systems and devices is expected to be completed by june  the requirements for the correction of year issues and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s current best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that may cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and collect all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities have not been and are not expected to be material to its results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
none of the company s other information technology projects have been delayed due to the implementation of year remediation efforts 
based on the nature of the company s business and the fact that no individual supplier or customer is material to its operations as a whole  management believes that the year issue is not reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
should the above described modifications to the company s systems not adequately address the year problem  the most likely worst case scenario is that there would be delays in the billing and collection of accounts receivable and accounts payable payments would be processed manually 
the above does not address all possible catastrophic events including  but not limited to  failure of the power grid or area wide telecommunications systems as the company is not aware that a material disruption in these basic infrastructures is reasonably likely to occur
