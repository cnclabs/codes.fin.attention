item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts and where noted 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
total um asset turns ratio of sales to total assets improved in because sales increased while average total assets increased only from the prior year 
year ending total assets were slightly higher because of the  increase in net intangible assets from the q acquisition of the gesco neonatal product line of cr bard  which exceeded offsetting substantial reductions in inventory and net property  plant and equipment assets pp e 
year end net intangible assets represent of total assets 
excluding the possibility of new intangible assets from acquisitions  total asset productivity should continue to improve in because sales are projected to grow while working capital remains about the same and net pp e assets decline as depreciation exceeds the rate of new purchases 
net after accumulated depreciation pp e in utah and oregon decreased  while in ireland remained about the same in us dollar terms  as a strengthening dollar offset depreciation 
consolidated pp e asset turns improved to based on year ending balances 
productivity of pp e in should continue to increase since sales are expected to increase  and net pp e decrease  as consolidated new capital expenditures are expected to be less than one half of depreciation 
inventory turns increased in due to higher sales together with lower inventory at year end 
lower inventory balances resulted from um using inventories previously accumulated in its business changes in average inventories of  in compared to  in and  in do not properly reflect the improvements made  since the year ending balance was less than the average  and considering that in inventories were acquired in july as part of the gesco acquisition 
inventory turns in will increase substantially if average inventories for the year remain near ending levels  and sales increase as expected 
the year ending accounts receivable a r balances declined about despite higher sales activity for the year 
calculated days in receivables improved to  based on q shipments activity 
despite average aging declining favorably to days in compared to days in th quarter base  aged a r over days from invoice date increased to about of total accounts receivable at year end 
the increase in the older receivables balance is due to one delinquent distributor in the far east  and two distributors in the us which were terminated at the end of um projects that these older accounts will be collected without a material write off 
the working capital decline of  in was primarily the result of a reduction in inventories 
through its excellent profitability  um expects to internally finance any working capital growth that is needed to support growth in sales activity 
b liabilities 
in  um s total debt ratio dropped to less than of total assets from at the end of in addition to current liabilities associated with current production and sales activity  um has a few lease obligations see note on page f and an unsecured line of credit 
the balance of the revolving line of credit declined  in  even though um acquired gesco for  in cash and paid  to repurchase its stock in the open market 
in  if no new significant acquisitions or repurchases of shares are made  the remaining revolving line of credit balance can be eliminated 
results of operations 
a revenues 
annual consolidated revenues were up in on a quarter to previous year s quarter basis  consolidated revenues were up   and  respectively 
um divides its sales channels in the us into direct sales which are sales to end user customers through um s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales representatives  and specialty distributors  and oem sales which are sales to other medical device companies where products are resold as part of a component of a kit or a repackaged stand alone product 
in  us direct sales represented of global consolidated sales compared to in and in in the us only  direct sales represented of sales compared to in and in us direct sales grew relative to the prior year 
as a percentage of total us sales  oem sales represented of sales  compared to in and in us oem sales excluding sales to baxter grew in foreign sales were  in compared to  in and  in foreign sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to in and in the downward trend is due to the loss of foreign sales to baxter  and a slow year in for sales of blood pressure monitoring bpm products  particularly in the far east 
foreign sales of bpm products were down relative to the prior year  excluding sales to baxter 
historically  practically all international sales have been bpm products 
ireland operations shipped of foreign sales in  compared with in and none in although still a small sales base in  foreign sales of ob gyn and neonatal products increased  surpassing million for the first time 
ob gyn and neonatal product sales were of foreign sales  compared to in and in following the acquisition of the gesco neonatal product line from cr bard  um divides its sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for improving clinician safety and for ease in performing delivery procedures  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological office clinician practices  including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal  comprised of devices for gaining vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  and other specialized tools used in the care of critically ill infants  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized tools for invasively monitoring blood pressure on a continuous basis with pressure transducer systems  along with products sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four areas  um s primary revenue contributors generally enjoy a dominant market share and typically have important product features protected by patents 
sales in the obstetrics product category increased in and represented of total sales 
obstetrics sales were  in  compared to  in and  in direct sales of the market leading iup catheter  intran r plus  grew as users that had previously switched to cheaper competing products in returned to intran  the most reliable product on the market 
sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads increased in  only because um sold those products for the full year in compared to one half year in after the cmi acquisition 
in may  the fda issued an advisory which warned of increases in reported injuries in the use of vads 
the advisory appears to have caused a slow down in usage as hospitals evaluated their protocols 
um responded by providing additional written instructions for use to all its users  and offering assistance in training 
in september  the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists issued a formal committee opinion that strongly recommended continued use of vads  when used by appropriately trained physicians 
um projects that demand for its vads products  accepted by many physicians as the safest available  will increase again in um s patented soft silicone cup is unique in the industry 
gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales grew in  and represented of total revenues 
sales in this category were  in  compared to  in and  in several products contributed to sales growth  including liberty tm  pathfinder r  and c letz contoured electrodes 
with the recent completion of an independent study concluding that um s patented epitome tm scalpel provides a significant improvement over older devices in wound healing and patient comfort  um looks to improve sales of its electrosurgical electrodes in marketing this group of products requires multiple sales call points and extensive clinical training and familiarization time with users  among other economic challenges  resulting in continued low adoption growth rates 
neonatal sales have previously been included in um s critical care product category  dominated by bpm product sales 
in late july  a significant initiative was the acquisition of the neonatal product line of gesco international 
because of the significance of the renowned gesco products  and their growth potential  um now separates neonatal product sales and bpm product sales 
compared to  um s neonatal product sales grew 
neonatal product sales were  in  compared to in and in um s growth in is expected to be primarily driven by the neonatal product line 
bpm and accessories sales represented of consolidated sales  declining from the prior year 
sales of bpm products in were  compared to  in and  in in this category  um depends heavily on the marketing efforts of other medical device companies which have included baxter the oem channel  both in the us and overseas 
non baxter global oem sales grew in global oem sales in were of total sales  compared to in and in  confirming that um is now depending less on the marketing efforts of other medical device companies 
b gross profits 
the average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus remaining after subtracting costs of manufacturing products from net revenues  in was compared to in and in um management believes that achieving an average gpm above is necessary to successfully cover the significant sales and marketing  research and development  and administrative expenses associated with a growth company in a highly complex and competitive marketplace 
the improving long term average gpm trend is explained by observing that um has become less dependent on lower margin oem sales  has developed its own direct sales force to replace lower margin sales through distributors  and has reduced the percentage of its sales of low margin blood pressure monitoring products 
in  although um achieved improvements in manufacturing overhead productivity as the result of higher sales  gpms were slightly lower due to somewhat unfavorable direct materials consumption and lower bpm product pricing overseas 
less than optimal materials usage inherently goes with large reductions in inventory  as occurred in looking forward to  offsetting influences are expected to result in gpm of about 
expected favorable influences include continued growth in sales volume without significantly increasing overhead expenses  fewer distributors resulting in higher prices for the same unit volume  and a larger percentage of total sales from neonatal products 
unfavorable influences are expected to be continued competitive pressure on pricing and higher wage rates for employees 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus remaining after subtracting operating expenses from gross profits 
operating expenses are subdivided into sales  general and administrative expenses sg a and research and development expenses r d 
um further divides sg a into the two categories of sales and marketing expenses s m and general and administrative expenses g a 
in  operating profits increased to  from  in  exceeding the increase in sales over the same period 
operating profits in  um s most profitable year historically  were  total operating expenses were of sales in compared to of sales in  and in um expects to enjoy further operating leverage in as sales continue to grow 
sg a expenses in decreased to of revenues from of revenues  although in dollar terms sg a expenses increased to  in from  in the g a expenses portion increased to  in from  in due essentially to increased expenses from goodwill amortization gwa associated with recent acquisitions 
gwa was in  compared to in and zero in looking forward  gwa in will be  without consideration for additional acquisitions in since the result of the acquisitions were marketable new products for um  these expenses can be regarded as a surrogate to r d expenses although they are captured in g a 
s m expenses are the costs of promoting  selling and providing customer support of um s products 
although sales and gpms improve when sales are made through directly employed sales representatives in lieu of independent distributors or oem customers  s m operating expenses increase as an offset 
global sales in increased while s m expenses increased  improving the productivity of s m resources 
the majority of um s s m expenses pertain to the us direct sales portion of its business 
us direct sales increased in in  um s s m expenses to sales ratio is expected to continue to benefit from sales increasing faster than s m expenses 
at the end of  um terminated all of the former gesco distributors and one additional us distributor previously representing about of domestic direct sales 
r d expenses in were of sales compared to of sales in  and in although lower as a percentage of sales  r d expenses in dollar terms were about the same as the prior year 
the majority of expenses in were committed to um s novel fetal ph monitoring program still under development 
other key projects  some of which are ongoing  included the development of the fowler endocurette  enhancements to both cmi vads and gesco neonatal product lines  a novel prendiville contoured cervical biopsy electrode  and continuing improvements to liberty  deltran plus and cordguard 
a number of important improvements in materials and configuration of components were also achieved which will reduce manufacturing costs and or increase product quality 
at um  r d resources are kept involved in the support of manufacturing processes  as um finds it makes long term sense to keep its most technical people involved with products throughout their life cycles 
um expects to continue r d expenses at approximately the same dollar level in d non operating income 
non operating income includes primarily royalties from licensing um s technology to other companies  but also interest and capital gains from investing the company s cash offset by interest expenses and bank fees on the revolving line of credit  and gains or losses from the sale of assets 
non operating income in was  compared to  in and  in there were unusual payments received in all three years for the use of um s pressure monitoring technology  which are subject to a confidentiality agreement 
those particular payments have now been concluded 
royalties received in were less than in the prior year 
in  there was also a one time gain from the sale of a small property no longer used by the company 
interest expenses and bank fees associated with the line of credit were in  in and zero in assuming no change in current interest rates and no new borrowing to finance an unusual capital requirement  net non operating income is expected to be about royalties received vary from period to period depending on the desire and or success of other companies in selling products licensed by um 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding um s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt  as a percentage of sales  was compared to and in and  respectively 
these profit margins are all extremely high when compared with similar firms in the medical device industry  or other industries 
the resulting profit dollars are equivalent to profits generated by well performing companies with twice or more the sales of um 
ebt in were up only relative to the prior year  while sales were up  because of the lower non operating income in um expects that it can continue its excellent profit performance in e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
um s net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for  and  respectively 
net income in was up 
after income taxes  net income was  compared to  in and  in  um s record year 
the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  differing balances in tax exempt investments  variations in the amount of exercised employee options which result in a tax benefit to the company  differences in distribution of state income taxes  differences in profitability of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on manufactured products  changes in the amount of non deductible goodwill expense resulting from a new acquisition  and other factors such as r d tax credits and actual litigation costs versus accrued expenses 
the amortization of goodwill associated with the columbia medical  inc acquisition is not tax deductible 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the current market value 
diluted eps were up to 
compared to 
in eps were 
ending weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps in thousands were  compared to  and  shares in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  future eps can be increased by investing current net income to increase future net profits through expanded product offerings and profitable business operations  or by repurchasing stock  thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares 
um believes that shareholder value is improved primarily by consistently increasing eps 
although um s eps increased in  the price of its stock decreased 
in contrast  the dow jones industrial average increased  the s p index increased  the nasdaq composite index increased  and the mddi index of medical device companies increased 
small cap companies were out of favor compared with the rest of the stock market in the valueline index  a widely accepted indicator of broader market values  declined 
historically  the progression of um s stock price has followed closely with its institutional ownership 
percentage institutional ownership of um at the end of was about compared with institutional ownership of the s p of about 
return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by um to internally finance its growth  divided by average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without any external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will support growth in revenues 
achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
roe in was  and has averaged over for the last twelve years 
cash flows and capital resources 
a cash flows 
ebdit ebt  adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  asset dispositions  and interest expense and bank fees associated with the line of credit is a good measure of um s ability to generate cash 
ebdit was million  up from  or as a ratio of sales  
ebdit has averaged of sales over the last five years 
the extraordinarily strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of excellent operating earnings and receipt of payments for the use of um s technology 
because of ebdit performance  um was able to simultaneously acquire the gesco neonatal product line with a million cash payment  purchase million in new property and equipment to maintain its facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order  acquire million in technology rights for new products in development  repurchase million worth of its shares  and reduce its bank revolving line of credit balance by million 
cash and equivalent balances were  at the end of um effectively maintains zero balance sweep cash account balances that minimize the line of credit balance  except for amounts held to meet operating requirements in ireland and separate physical reserves set aside for litigation expenses and other contractual commitments where cash has been committed 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in financing activities in used cash of  to reduce the line of credit balance 
in addition   shares of stock were repurchased at an average cost  including commissions  of share  using  in cash 
um received in cash from the sale of  shares of stock through an employee option exercise at a price of 
in six years since the end of  um has invested million in repurchasing million of its common shares at an average price  including commissions  of per share 
during the same time span  um received million from the issuance of million shares of stock at an average price of per share from exercises of employee options 
ten times more shares were retired than were issued 
in the four years prior to under prior management  um received million from the issuance of million shares from employee options at an average price of per share 
during the same time span  um repurchased million shares at an average cost of per share 
under previous management  times more shares were issued than were repurchased  diluting shareholder interests while receiving only per share 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans 
planned capital expenditures  expected to be consistent in magnitude with  will keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to the capital expenditures  um plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases while the price of the stock remains extremely undervalued  and  if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that strategically fit um s business and are accretive to performance 
um plans to use any cash not needed for the above pursuits during the remainder of to reduce the line of credit balance 
however  the revolving credit line will continue to be used for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time 
management s outlook 
there are three key points for shareholders to remember with regard to performance all key measures of um s performance in were positive  as a quick review of the accompanying financial statements will demonstrate  the major initiative for the year was the gesco acquisition 
um successfully completed integration of manufacturing operations in utah 
the sales battle to retain the base of business is ongoing  given that the crbard distributor contracts acquired with the deal expired at the end of  and um continued to successfully defend its dominant obstetrical market position of its product  intran r plus 
in  management expects to be able to build on the momentum 
um now has a focus in two special and independent areas of hospitals in the us  l d departments and nicu s  where it can supply a robust line of well accepted and differentiated specialty products 
the success of the gesco neonatal product line will be most responsible for um s short term growth 
um s direct us sales team has evolved following several years of investment and development into a key resource for achieving um s objectives to help clarify clinician needs  to responsively provide excellent solutions for those needs  and to assure timely support for clinical customers use of um s solutions 
access to us hospital customers is increasingly constrained by group purchasing decisions 
to be successful in its marketing programs  um must provide clinicians with the information they need to make important judgments about using certain products in obtaining optimal clinical outcomes  which include minimizing risk of complications 
um must also be able to provide support for physicians to explain those needs to hospital administrators who are primarily focused on reducing current operating costs 
being able to survive and prosper in an environment favoring a commodity marketing orientation which is contrary to um s approach is the clearest manifestation of um s competitive success 
for example  um s challenge is to demonstrate that all intrauterine pressure monitoring catheters used in high risk child births are not the same when it comes to risk of complications or adverse surprises 
where um has a proprietary advantage  it must actively defend its existing patents from infringers and continue to develop new products representing a quantum improvement in care 
it is management s hope that the fetal ph monitoring product  under development for the past five years  may become such a product 
although in um did not achieve the technical milestones it targeted  it will continue to invest in the fetal ph project  which  if successful  would be a major company defining event 
in addition  um hopes the federal judicial process will allow a resolution of its two intran iupc patent infringement lawsuits in um s growing number of gynecology practice tools are intended to leverage um s reputation with physicians outside the hospital 
the niche markets for which um s gynecology electro surgery urology products are targeted have proven to require many and varied marketing initiatives 
they require individual user training together with clear evidence of improved outcomes 
sales of new products are growing slowly  but consistently 
um s financial strength and stability allows it to patiently investigate economic ways to increase the rate of adoption of its newer products 
the fowler endocurette for uterine biopsies  delayed in by the fda regulatory approval process  is an example of such a project 
um will continue to maintain a long term perspective and seek to strengthen its disease management focus with physicians who it believes are ultimately responsible for their patients well being 
internationally  where um must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and actively recruit needed new business partners 
in  um expects its ireland subsidiary  which shipped of all foreign sales in  to increasingly contribute to um s excellent performance 
year state of readiness um believes it will experience no material adverse consequences from the year yk problem  and is taking appropriate actions to see that it is prepared in all of its operations globally 
um has developed a yk plan it is using to identify and solve potential yk problems 
the company has determined that all of the products it sells are yk compliant since none of them use or process dates in any form 
a complete inventory of all known internal systems both information technology and non it  along with initial testing of those systems has been completed 
these efforts show that most  but not all of the systems um relies on to manufacture  test  assemble  and package its products are yk compliant 
the version of the integrated manufacturing control software dataworks um uses was recently upgraded and is currently being tested to ensure it is yk compliant 
other systems that were identified as non compliant either have been or are scheduled to be updated prior to may  solutions to all identified yk problems are expected to be in place  along with company wide yk compliance  by july  um has surveyed those outside vendors it considers critical to its business  including utilities and other providers of auxiliary systems  regarding their yk readiness 
response assessment and implementation of appropriate remedial action is ongoing 
costs um does not expect its yk costs to be material 
um s products are all compliant and its major software systems are now or should soon be compliant with upgrades provided under maintenance contracts 
some software and older systems must be replaced  with the total cost expected to be less than  risks as um s products do not incorporate date codes  yk risks based on its products are minor 
because the major internal systems um relies on have either been confirmed compliant or will be upgraded to a compliant version prior to july   the risk of these systems failing also appears to be low 
however  although considered unlikely  it is possible that a major yk problem might be identified 
um has competent employees who it believes can find solutions to problems identified 
perhaps the greatest internal risk would be from a yk issue that remains hidden despite diligent testing 
if such a problem developed either shortly before or after january   um could face delays and costs that might be material to its business 
um believes external yk problems constitute a higher magnitude of risk to its business 
if mission critical vendors do not timely and accurately report to um their yk readiness  or adequately solve yk problems as anticipated  the company s business could be materially impacted 
if alternate vendors cannot be identified and qualified in time to replace vendors who will not be yk compliant  um s business could be negatively impacted 
the failure of communications  financial and transportation systems could have a major negative impact on um  as would the failure of local utilities to deliver water  natural gas  and electricity 
contingency plans execution of the company s yk plan is um s most important contingency plan 
it will not only identify what yk risks it faces  but provide a framework for how to solve them 
for example  um is prepared to switch vendors  install yk compliant systems and stock excess raw material and finished goods inventory to mitigate yk risks 
um employs skilled individuals who have the technical know how to solve most challenges likely to be presented by the yk problem 
um believes that the most likely worst case scenario would involve business interruptions of up to one or two weeks 
um believes it could solve such problems before they became major risks to its business 
um does not believe it can develop contingency plans to deal adequately with major external infrastructure failures such as in communications  transportation  or utilities 
however  such failures would likely not impact um any more than it would other businesses 
accounting policy changes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  um believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has manufacturing operations  including assets  in ireland denominated in irish punts  and sells products under agreements denominated in various western european currencies 
the irish punt and other currencies are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond the control of um 
the exchange rate for the irish punt was  
and 
per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
please see note  page f um minimizes its foreign currency risk without separate hedging transactions by converting currencies as transactions occur
