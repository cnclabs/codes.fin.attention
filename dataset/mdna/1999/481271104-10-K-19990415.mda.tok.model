for the year ended december   total hours billed were  with an average billing rate of  compared to total hours billed of  with an average billing rate of for the prior year period 
the decrease in total hours billed in compared with was due to a focus of sales efforts on higher margin placements and to a decrease in the annual billed hours by the company s national and regional offices located in providence  rhode island  and its regional office located in needham  massachusetts

a part of the increase in revenues includes anticipated full year results of the businesses acquired in the first and second quarter of  as well as increased revenues generated by planned expansion of the sales and recruiting staffs in the contract placement and permanent placement businesses 
the internal operating plan more closely ties management s compensation to its ability to meet revenue and profit goals 
if the company is able to achieve its internal operating plan  which relies upon certain assumptions including  but not limited to  its ability to increase sales and recruiting staffs in the contract placement and permanent placement businesses  to achieve profitability in the information management solutions business through concentration on higher margin business  and to maintain stricter cost controls in all of its operating units  the company believes it can achieve operating income of approximately of revenues

 dollars in thousands net revenues         cost of sales exclusive of items shown separately below         selling and operating         general and administrative         total costs and expenses         income loss before non recurring charges and other items      non recurring charges  interest income expense and other  net income loss before income taxes      because the company only derives revenue in its contract placement business when its consultants are actually working  its revenues and operating results are adversely affected when its clients facilities close due to holidays or inclement weather 
during the quarters ended december  and  the number of holidays and vacation days slightly affected revenues in the contract placement business 
in addition  the company s contract placement business experienced higher than expected turnover of recruiting and sales personnel in the third and fourth quarters of the effect of this turnover  as well as lower than expected revenues in the information management solutions business  was the primary cause of the decrease in revenues on a quarter to quarter basis in the second half of liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s need for working capital has increased as its revenues have grown and it has used borrowings under its credit facility to fund working capital 
in february  however  the funds available for working capital purposes increased substantially as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from its initial public offering 
the company has used the net proceeds from the offering as well as its cash flow from operations to fund its acquisitions and working capital 
in june the company began using its line of credit to fund the cost of its acquisitions and for working capital  and as of december   million was owing on the line 
the company typically maintains minimal cash balances as reflected in the balance of  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  the company redeemed its short term investments of approximately million held at december  and used the proceeds to acquire substantially all of the assets of isi and cella 
the company used cash in operations of  million  and million in  and  respectively 
this result is primarily attributable to the company s net loss for which was partly offset by non cash non recurring charges and depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the redemption of short term investments noted above was offset by a corresponding increase in accounts receivable related to increased sales 
as discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company has issued common stock as part of the purchase price of some of its acquisitions with a guarantee that the market price of such stock will equal or exceed specified prices per share at future dates 
if the determination dates were december  the company would have to make a cash payment at least equal to the amount reflected as other liabilities on its balance sheet to meet that condition 
additionally as discussed in note in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements the company is obligated to make cash payments in based on certain of the businesses acquired having attained specified pre tax income amounts in the company has determined that additional payments under the terms of its various purchase agreements will total approximately million in the first and second quarters of however  the company is still holding discussions with one seller and that seller s accountants and the amounts may change 
the company intends to use its line of credit  as well as any other sources of funding that may become available to it  to fund these payments 
the company is currently negotiating with its bank for additional credit availability based on the sale of certain of its fixed assets 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to successfully negotiate new credit on terms acceptable to the company 
cash purchases of fixed assets for the fiscal years ended december    and were million  million  and  respectively 
these purchases were related primarily to the purchases of computers  software  and imaging equipment to upgrade the company s technology infrastructure  as well as the furnishing of its new office facilities 
the company plans to use approximately million for capital expenditures in in the company used million to complete acquisitions and an additional  to repay indebtedness assumed in several of its acquisitions 
in the first quarter of the company received repayment of its loans to officers and related parties in the aggregate amount of  during the company repaid the remaining  balance outstanding on the notes payable related to the berkeley acquisition  and repurchased as treasury stock  common shares  at a price of per share  which had been issued to the stockholders of berkeley in lieu of  of notes payable at the completion of the initial public offering 
the company currently has available a million revolving advance facility the line of credit with pnc bank  na the bank the line of credit expires on may  this facility allows the company to borrow the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable  or million 
as of december  the company had million outstanding against the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains customary restrictive covenants  including limitations on loans the company may extend to officers and employees  the incurring of additional debt and the payment of dividends on the company s common shares 
the line of credit bears interest  at the company s option  at either the bank s prime rate or basis points over the london inter bank offering rate libor 
at december  the company was in violation of the following financial covenants total allowed capital expenditures by the company  and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the bank has agreed to waive these violations and to modify the covenants for future periods 
the company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be to fund increases in accounts receivable and fund internal growth through new office locations 
the company believes that the borrowings under the line of credit  or other credit facilities which may be available to the company in the future  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
inflation the company does not believe that the rates of inflation prevailing in the united states in recent years have had a significant effect on its operations 
year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the company communicates 
the company has received assurance from its vendor that its recently implemented financial information system is year compliant 
further  the company is currently in the process of replacing its two candidate and client databases utilized in its contract placement and permanent placement business with software systems that are represented by the vendor to be year compliant 
the company is analyzing its remaining computer systems to identify any potential year issues and will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis 
although management has not yet determined the cost related to achieving year compliance  management believes  based on its available information that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effects on its business operations or financial condition 
forward looking information this report and other reports and statements filed by the company from time to time with the securities and exchange commission collectively  sec filings contain or may contain certain forward looking statements and information that are based on beliefs of  and information currently available to  the company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by the company s management 
when used in sec filings  and in oral statements by the company the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  future  intend  plan and similar expressions as they relate to the company or the company s management  identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to the company s operations and results of operations  competitive factors and pricing pressures  shifts in market demand  the performance and needs of the industries served by the company  and other risks and uncertainties  including  in addition to any uncertainties specifically identified in the text surrounding such statements and those identified below  uncertainties with respect to changes or developments in social  economic  business  industry  market  legal and regulatory circumstances and conditions and actions taken or omitted to be taken by third parties  including the company s shareholders  customers  suppliers  business partners  competitors  and legislative  regulatory  judicial and other governmental authorities and officials 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated  believed  estimated  expected  intended or planned 
dependence on availability of qualified technical consultants the company is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain technical consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of its clients 
to keep pace with rapidly evolving information technologies and changing client needs  the company must continually evaluate and upgrade its database of available qualified technical consultants 
competition for individuals with proven technical skills is intense  and  as is currently customary in the industry  the company does not have any exclusive contracts with its consultants 
the company competes for such individuals with other providers of technical staffing services  systems integrators  providers of outsourcing services  computer systems consultants  clients and temporary personnel agencies 
factors influencing such competition include compensation  benefits  growth opportunities and pre existing relationships with other companies  particularly specialty staffing companies 
as the company expands into new geographic areas  it may experience difficulty attracting qualified technical consultants who have a prior relationship or familiarity with more established specialty staffing companies in such areas 
there can be no assurance that qualified technical consultants will continue to be available to the company in sufficient numbers to meet the company s current and anticipated growth requirements 
acquisition risks a component of the company s growth strategy is the acquisition of companies that will complement and expand the company s existing businesses  principally in new geographic markets 
the successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on the company s ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire such companies on suitable terms and integrate their operations with those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that  if identified  the company will be able to acquire such companies on suitable terms 
the specialty staffing industry is relatively mature 
acquisitions in this industry are therefore likely to be at higher relative prices than for other industries due to competition from other staffing companies for acquisition candidates 
acquisitions also involve a number of special risks  including i adverse effects on the company s reported operating results  including increased goodwill amortization and interest expense  ii diversion of management attention  iii risks associated with unanticipated problems  liabilities or contingencies  iv difficulties and higher than expected costs related to the integration of the acquired business  and v dilution of existing shareholders 
the occurrence of some or all of the events described in these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to manage growth sustained or significant growth  if achieved  will subject the company to risks by placing a substantial strain on the company s available managerial  sales  recruiting  financial and other resources 
specifically  such growth will require the company to i hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing markets as well as markets in which the company has no prior operating experience  ii develop and maintain relationships with an increasingly large number of highly qualified technical consultants  iii maintain cost controls in all of the company s businesses  and iv apply its management practices to a significantly larger organization
