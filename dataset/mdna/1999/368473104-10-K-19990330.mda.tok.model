item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general geerlings wade is a direct marketer of premium  imported and domestic wines and wine related merchandise to individual consumers 
in  sales increased  or  from  in to sales of  in the increase in revenues did not meet the company s expectation due to weaker than expected response rates to house mailings during the first eight months of however  the company achieved its primary goal for  which was to increase net income from the company earned  in operating income in as compared to  in this marked improvement in operating income resulted from higher sales and increased gross profit margin by basis points

delivery expense also increased during primarily as a result of rate increases by courier services 
in  the company focused on improving the balance sheet  and did so by lowering inventory by yearend from  in to  in the company was also able to improve terms from certain suppliers during and thereby leverage its working capital 
the company s cash balance as of december  was  as compared to  with an outstanding balance under its line of credit of  at december  the company operated in from licensed facilities in separate states to comply with laws and regulations related to the retail sale of wine 
operating these separate locations forces the company to incur unusually high overhead expense as a percentage of sales 
the company continuously looks to lower these fixed costs and manage variable costs to improve operating margins 
the company opened its first licensed facility in  three additional licensed facilities in each of and  one facility in  five facilities in  one in  one a retail store in and one in from these facilities  the company is able to serve customers in states

the company considers each area served by a licensed facility  excluding the newbury street store and the canton  ma facility  to be a separate market 
in  the company continued testing various new marketing programs to find ways to increase revenues including continuity wine of the month programs  corporate affinity marketing programs affinity programs and outbound telemarketing programs 
in july  the company purchased the assets of passport wine club  which offers both continuity programs and individual cases of wine to customers 
in  the company plans to continue operating this separate business as passport wine and to direct geerlings wade customers or potential customers to passport wine in order to increase sales for this business 
the company has determined that affinity programs offered in stores or direct mail pieces of its partners do not warrant further investment by the company 
however  the company plans to explore partnering with companies in attempt to market wine over the internet 
telemarketing  on the other hand  has proved successful  and the company plans to significantly increase its outbound telemarketing to its customer base 
as part of this program  the company plans to curtail mailings to these customers that are called so as to reduce mailing expense 
holiday catalogs offering wine and wine related accessories were mailed in sales results from these marketing pieces encourage further development of the catalog in an effort to make it a significant contributor to revenues in the future 
the company has mailed  for the first time  three separate catalogs in the first quarter of and plans to mail holiday catalogs in the fall of in may of  the company commenced selling wine from its website at www 
geerwade 
com 
this website was revamped in october and will be completely redesigned with interactive elements by hill  holliday  connors  cosmopulos  inc hill  holliday 
the company plans to launch the new website in the third quarter of since the third quarter of  sales from this website continue to grow each month even though the fourth quarter has produced historically the largest percentage of sales for the company compared to the next three quarters 
in addition to redesigning the existing website  www 
geerwade 
com  the company plans to launch later in the third quarter of a totally separate website  which offers a broad selection of nationally branded wines that will only be marketed on the website 
a new image will be developed for this e commerce business  and the company will market this e commerce website separately and test new forms of advertising such as space advertisements  radio and internet banner advertising as well as develop relationship with other websites and companies 
both the new website and www 
geerwade 
com will be interactive with the company s main computer system and database and allow customers to view only inventory that is available for sale  check the status of their orders and receive ups tracking numbers when applicable to track the location of their packages 
this new computer system will replace the existing computer system that supports the majority of the company s information requirements 
the company plans to convert to this new system in the summer of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of wine  wine related accessories and memberships 
sales from memberships and wine related accessories were approximately of overall revenues in and in the company s sales growth between and reflects increased comparative state sales for all states markets except massachusetts  new jersey and washington 
comparative sales were down for massachusetts  for new jersey and for washington 
comparative sales increased by in connecticut and new york  in illinois and florida  in california  in virginia  in ohio  in minnesota  in colorado  in arizona and in michigan 
the company hopes to increase sales in all markets in the following table sets forth total sales by market for the periods indicated years ended december  market in thousands massachusetts      connecticut      new york      illinois      florida      california      new jersey      washington december    virginia january     ohio april     minnesota july colorado july arizona september michigan june totals      includes sales from catalog accessories and from the newbury street  boston store 
includes authorized sales into additional states 
the company believes that if customers develop trust in the company s ability to select and deliver quality wines at attractive prices  they tend to make more wine purchases from the company  including more expensive selections 
in general  the company sells its more expensive wines at a lower gross margin percentage than its less expensive wines 
consequently  the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales diminishes if the average price point of the company s product mix increases 
the company seeks to manage its gross profit through management of the average price point of its wines and overall product mix 
the company expects that its gross profit as a percentage of sales will continue to fluctuate depending upon the average price point of its product mix in each period  which in turn will be affected by the number of new customers generated by acquisition mailings and other marketing programs under development 
the price point for initial purchases by new customers is normally under the company s average price point  therefore  increased orders by new customers lowers the average price point for the company 
the company sent house mailings in and in and plans to mail the house mailings in to its active customers 
by keeping the number of mailings relatively constant  the marketing cost per customer remains nearly constant 
the company is focusing its efforts to increase the average order size and order frequency to leverage its marketing costs and improve profitability 
although  the average case price was lower in  the company does not intend to adjust prices in the immediate future to encourage sales 
in  the company sold its wine in quantities of  and bottles  and allowed customers to select a mix of any wines available in stock 
in the fall of  the company decided to discontinue bottle purchases due to the high cost of fulfilling each order measured as a percentage of sales 
however  the company intends to continue to offer or bottle shipments as part of gift packages offered in its catalogs or as part of the subscription or continuity programs in which the ability to pre package shipments affords operating efficiencies that warrant promoting these types of offers 
the company uses the term case as an operating characteristic to describe any twelve bottle equivalent unit 
results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth as a percentage of total sales certain items reflected in the company s statements of income for the years ended december    and and pro forma statements of income for the year ended december  years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest expense income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss pro forma income before taxes pro forma income taxes pro forma net income years ended december   and sales sales increased  or  from  in to  in this increase was attributable to a sales increase for all markets opened prior to and a sales increase for michigan  which opened in included in the  of sales for were sales of  generated from the company s catalogs  which is nearly the same as the catalog sales of  in sales increased  or  from  in to  in this increase resulted from the combination of a sales increase for markets opened prior to and an increase for markets opened during the number of cases sold by the company increased by  or  from  in to  in from to  the number of cases sold increased from  to  a increase 
the average case price for cases sold by the company decreased from in to in  which is a decrease 
this decrease is due to the combination of maintaining case prices consistent with and the effects of mailing substantially more acquisition pieces which resulted in more first time customers in than in the average price per case for the company was skewed downward by the lower price point for these first time customers 
the average price per case for sales to repeat customers actually increased about from to the company does not see the need to lower prices further to compete in the market place 
this does not preclude price adjustments that may be necessary to track price trends in the marketplace that may be precipitated by market factors such as a drop in the price of wine from suppliers or major changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in  geerlings wade changed the product mix to lower priced products and began periodic discounting on selected products to reduce inventory and maintain a manageable number of stock keeping units 
the average case price for cases sold by the company decreased from in to in  which is an decrease 
this average price decrease was primarily due to a decision to offer wines at lower price points to generate higher sales and response rates to promotional mailings 
the average number of cases purchased per month customer decreased from per year in to per year in the increase in sales to first time buyers  who buy less than one case on average for their first purchase  was the major factor in reducing the annual  average number of cases purchased 
while the average case purchased per month buyer decreased from to  the average number of cases purchased by repeat buyers decreased from to from cases per repeat buyer in to cases in the average number of cases purchased per customer each year increased from in to in this increase was attributable  in part  to lower price points in than in which permits customers to purchase larger quantities without increasing their average order 
gross profit in  gross profit increased  or  from  in to  in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in this increase in gross profit resulted from improved purchasing by the company and by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
gross profit increased  or  from  in to  in  while increasing as a percentage of sales from in to in this increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales resulted from improved purchasing by the company as well 
gross profit for all sales including accessory sales per case of wine sold was in  which is an increase of per case from per case in in  the gross profit per case was per case 
this decrease from to resulted from lowering the average price paid for each case of wine sold by the company in the company hopes to improve gross margin as a percentage of sales by improving purchasing in but can make no guarantee that it will achieve this goal 
adding more nationally branded wines to the product mix tends to lower the overall gross profit percentage since these wines generate much lower margins than the present selection of wines sold by the company 
so if the company sells a higher percentage of these nationally branded wines in the future  the gross profit percentage will decrease 
the company plans to increase the proportion of nationally branded products if it can successfully offset a lower gross profit with savings in marketing and by increasing response rates to the company s various advertising programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in to  in  while increasing as a percentage of sales from in to in this increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses was attributable to both fixed and variable costs 
for variable costs  advertising costs  which are mostly comprised of direct mail that the company sends to prospective and repeat customers increased from to in  advertising costs were  and in were  which is an increase of  most of this increase is attributable to the company mailing about one million more pieces of promotional mail to prospective customers acquisition mailings in than in additionally  the company amortizes the cost of these acquisition mailings over five months and in the fall of  the company increased significantly the number of these mailings 
therefore  some of the increased costs were capitalized and expensed in the first four months of thereby adding to advertising expense 
credit card fees increased due to higher rates charged by credit card companies  compounded by higher sales and higher shipping and handling fees charged by the company 
the company does not include shipping and handling revenue that it charges customers in its sales but nets this revenue against delivery expense  therefore  whenever  the company increases its shipping and handling fees to customers  the company incurs higher credit card fees which results in higher credit card fees as a percentage of sales 
this affect is magnified when the prices for the company s products remain stable 
as for fixed costs  in the company operated and incurred the related costs of operating its michigan retail facility for a full year as compared to when the company opened that facility in the second quarter 
the company also opened the newbury street store in boston in the second quarter of and incurred the cost of opening and operating that store 
also  the company acquired the assets of passport wine club in july and consolidated its existing california operations located in san jose with the passport operations by relocating both groups to a new retail facility in petaluma  california 
the petaluma facility is a much larger facility than the one in san jose that was operated by the company in additionally  five people were hired as part of the passport acquisition  and this significantly increased the general and administrative expense for finally  the company entered into a lease in stafford  texas in october in preparation of opening a retail facility in texas 
in total  rent expense for was  in and  in which is an increase of  the company has also hired personnel for the sales and customer service department to improve customer service and in the marketing department to increase the productivity of its marketing programs and expand into the wine accessory catalog and wine and accessory sales over the internet 
the company launched its e commerce website in may and continually upgraded it throughout selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  in to  in  while decreasing as a percentage of sales from in to in this decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increasing shipping and handling fees charged to customers  reducing salaries and lowering the cost per piece of mail for acquisition mailing campaigns 
the opening of the michigan facility added to the company s fulfillment expense as did increased staffing in the customer service and sales departments which was done to improve the level of customer service 
marketing costs increased by  in from  in to  in  which is a increase 
most of the increase resulted from mailing the additional wine and wine accessories catalog in the spring of interest income expense in  interest expense decreased  or from  in to  in interest income increased  from  in to  in the net effect was that the company had a net interest expense of  in and net interest income of  in this was an improvement of  between and this dramatic change in net interest was due to paying down the line of credit with cash generated from operations 
for  net interest expense decreased  or  from net interest expense of  in to a net interest expense of  in this decrease in net interest expense was due to reduced borrowings under the company s line of credit to support working capital needs throughout provision for income taxes the company was subject to corporate level income taxes for the entirety of  and income taxes were benefited at approximately in and income taxes were provided at in and in these tax rates are reflective of the company s effective c corporation income tax rates in each of these periods 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital needs continue to be funding the cost of acquisition mailings and purchases of inventory to support sales growth 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling  in addition  the company has a credit facility with the first national bank of boston bankboston comprised of a revolving discretionary demand line of credit in the maximum principal amount equal to the lesser of of qualifying inventory or million the line of credit 
the line of credit bears interest at bankboston s base rate which approximates the prime rate plus one half of one percent  and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
as of december   the company had no borrowings under the line of credit 
in  the company generated  in cash from operating activities compared to generating  in the increase in cash generated from operations resulted primarily from net income of  a decrease in inventory of  and increases in accounts payable of  and in deferred revenue of  this cash flow increases were offset by increases in prepaid mailing costs of  and decreases in accrued expenses of  and accrued sales  income and payroll tax of  at december  and december  the company had working capital of  and  respectively 
the company lowered inventory levels in and expects to maintain these lower inventory levels in the future 
inventory levels will fluctuate with seasonal demand and overall sales growth 
as a result of the alcoholic beverage regulatory scheme within which the company operates  the company is required to maintain separate inventories in each of the markets in which it operates a licensed facility and is not permitted to transfer inventory between such facilities 
as a result  the company believes that its overall inventory levels are necessarily higher than would be required if the company were not subject to such regulatory requirements 
in the first quarter of  the company opened the texas licensed facility 
the inventory for this facility adds to the overall inventory levels 
during  net cash of  was used in investing activities 
the company used cash from operations and borrowings under its line of credit to invest approximately  in property and equipment 
these purchases included approximately  in computer and telephone hardware and software enhancements and  of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixture purchases 
the company received  from a vendor in exchange for returning an asset previously paid for by the company 
on july   the company purchased the assets of passport gift company  inc d b a passport wine club for cash consideration of  an additional  was used for acquisitions costs 
during  total cash used for financing activities was  of which  represented borrowings under the line of credit and  was used for repayment of line of credit borrowings 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and current cash balances  together with the availability under its line of credit  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
exchange rates the company engages in currency hedging activities related to firm commitments for the purchase of inventories in an effort to fix costs and manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the company maintains two separate foreign exchange lines with bankboston and the chase manhattan bank  each of which allow the company to enter into forward currency exchange contracts of up to  maturing on any one day 
as of december   the company had foreign exchange contracts outstanding to purchase million french francs equivalent to approximately  at december

in addition  the company has only limited management  operational and financial resources to accommodate continued growth  should it occur 
the company s ability to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to hire and train new employees 
these demands are expected to require additional management resources and the development of additional expertise by existing management 
the failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that geerlings wade will be able successfully to attract and retain the skilled and experienced personnel required to manage its business 
effectiveness and cost of mailings  cost of paper 
the company targets potential new customers and solicits orders from existing customers through direct mail marketing campaigns 
direct mail marketing campaigns are capital intensive and the cost effectiveness of such campaigns depends  to a large extent  upon the accuracy of assumptions and judgments made by the company 
there can be no assurance that such direct marketing campaigns will be completed on a cost effective basis 
the failure of any such marketing campaign to identify new customers or to generate new purchases from existing customers on a cost effective basis may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

dependence on consumer spending  geographic concentration of customers 
the success of geerlings and wade depends upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending  including the general state of the economy  federal and state tax rates and consumer confidence

competition  changes in consumer tastes

year compliance 
the year issue relates to computer programs and systems that recognize dates using two digit year data rather than four digit year data 
as a result  such programs and systems may fail or provide incorrect information when using dates after december  if the year issue were to cause disruptions to the company s internal information technology systems or to the information technology systems of entities with whom the company has commercial relationships  material adverse effects to the company s operations could result 
the company s internal computer programs and operating systems consist of programs and systems relating to virtually all segments of the company s business  including merchandising  customer database management and marketing  order processing  fulfillment  inventory management  customer service and financial reporting 
these programs and systems are primarily comprised of front end systems 
these systems automate and manage business functions such as order taking and order processing  inventory  management  fulfillment operations as the company s retail facilities and financial reporting 
users within the company interface with these systems through personal computers via a local area network and from distant locations through a private network using the internet 
these users also use and access through their personal computers off the shelf e mail  work processing  spreadsheet and other commercial software applications 
customer database management systems 
these systems facilitate the storage of customer data and direct response and catalog mailings for the company 
currently  the company s internal customer database management system is integrated with the existing front end system of the company 
telecommunications systems 
these systems enable the company to manage their order taking and customer service functions 
voicemail systems 
these systems are used for receiving and storing messages to employees at various company facilities 
ancillary services systems 
these include such systems as heating  ventilation and air conditioning control systems and security systems 
the company has completed preliminary reviews of its internal front end systems  its customer database management systems  and its personal computers and local area networks  to assess the potential impact of the year issue 
these preliminary reviews were completed by the company s existing workforce at no identifiable incremental cost 
based upon these reviews  the company believes that all of these systems and equipment will operate correctly when processing data that include dates after december  except for its front end processing system 
the company believes that minor remediation or expenditures are required to ensure continued proper operation of such systems and equipment other than the front end processing system 
the company has purchased a replacement software system for front end processing and a new production database that are year compliant 
this system includes the catman catalog software that is developed and sold by axexxis corporation and runs on the universe data base that is sold by ardent software  inc both of these systems process dates based on a system that adds or subtracts days from a starting date  which is time zero 
therefore  the system does not rely on years stored as either or digit number such as or and  as represented to the company  will not fail to function when january  arrives 
the company has also purchased a new server for this software which the vendor represents is year compliant 
in addition to addressing the year issue  this new software and hardware system will enhance the functionality and capability of the company s entire computer system 
the company plans to conduct further reviews and tests of its systems and equipment to insure that all potential year issues have been addressed 
the approximate cost to purchase this new system  including any necessary hardware  and to program the new websites planned for the company will be between  and  the company has not yet completed reviews of its internal telecommunications systems and its internal voicemail and ancillary services systems 
based on its preliminary reviews  the company has been advised by its telephone system vendor that a  software update can be purchased to bring the company s telephone system into compliance 
the company intends to purchase such software 
the company does not anticipate that upon further reviews that any remediation relating to such other systems that might be necessary will cause the company to incur material costs or present implementation challenges that cannot be addressed prior to the end of calendar year the company expects to complete its reviews of these systems in the first half of calendar year the computer programs and operating systems used by entities with whom the company has commercial relationships also pose potential problems relating to the year issue  which may affect the company s operations in a variety of ways 
these risks are more difficult to assess than those posed by internal programs and systems  and the company has not yet completed a plan for assessing them 
the company believes that the programs and operating systems used by entities with which it has commercial relationships generally fall into two categories first  the company relies on programs and systems used by providers of services necessary to it to reach and communicate with its customers 
examples of such providers include the united states postal service  ups  telephone companies  customer list processors and rental agencies  printers and banks 
services provided by such entities affect almost all facets of the company s operations  including processing of orders  printing and mailing of direct response mail and catalogs  shipping of goods and certain financial services eg  credit card processing 
programs and services in this first category generally are not specific to the company s business and disruptions in their availability would likely have a negative impact on most enterprises within the direct marketing industry and on many enterprises outside the direct marketing industry 
the company believes that all of the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios involving disruptions to its operations stemming from the year issue relate to programs and systems in this first category 
the company intends to include an evaluation of such scenarios in its plan for assessing the programs and systems of the entities with which it has commercial relationships 
second  the company relies on programs and systems used by a variety of vendors of the products it markets in  the company purchased goods from many vendors 
in the case of risks posed by the year issue relating to programs and systems in this second category that are used by product vendors  such risks are minimal and correctable since these vendors are relatively small companies and generally rely on off the shelf software programs and hardware 
the company intends to include in its plan for assessing the programs and systems of the entities with whom it has commercial relationships the solicitation of assurances of year compliance from each vendor that is significant to the company 
the company expects to complete its plan for assessing the programs and systems of the entities with whom it has commercial relationships by the end of may and the identification of related risks and uncertainties by the end of the second quarter of fiscal once such identification has been completed  the company intends to resolve any material risks and uncertainties that are identified by communicating further with the relevant vendors  by working internally to identify alternative sourcing and by formulating contingency plans to deal with such matters 
the company expects the resolution of such matters to continue until all year problems are resolved satisfactorily 
dependence on computers 
the company relies on software  hardware  the internet and telecommunications equipment and services to transact  process  record keep  analyze and manage all aspects of its business 
in the event any of these major components or services fail for an extended period of time  this could have an adverse material effect on the company s operations  sales and profitability 
additionally  the company plans to begin using the new catman computer system in the third quarter in the event this system conversion is delayed  this will have an adverse material affect on the company  and the company will have to take extraordinary measures to remediate its present computer system so that it is year compliant 
market risk 
the company does not engage in any activity involving market risk sensitive instruments other than foreign exchange forward contracts described herein that are material to the business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
