item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and financial condition general the period from has been a time of transition for the company 
we began this period as a direct marketing business with a single significant catalog title and many plans for the future 
at the end of this period  we are still a direct marketing business  but we now have four catalog titles in active or developmental stages 
we also have more new catalogs in development with test marketing planned in additionally  we developed and tested for the first time in a specialty mailing concept within our paper based marketing program 
as a consequence of these changes  our customer base has expanded substantially 
we also made major changes with respect to our product mix as we developed our new catalogs 
currently  we advertise and sell primarily gift  home decor and other merchandise items as compared to when we advertised and sold primarily personalized paper products 
over the past three years  we also acquired property and constructed a larger and technologically more advanced headquarters and operations facility 
finally  we have recently been preparing to launch a substantial e commerce initiative 
all of these changes have had an impact on our revenues  costs and profitability 
our revenues have increased during this period  although the costs associated with generating the increased revenues have  not surprisingly  increased at a disproportionately greater rate 
these costs include costs associated with developing new catalogs and prospecting for customers 
also  gift  home decor and other merchandise items have higher costs as a percentage of sales and higher price points than personalized paper products 
other costs and revenues were occasionally impacted over the three year period by other uncertainties associated with our business such as changes in the cost of paper used to print our catalogs  catalog distribution issues  customer and prospect receptiveness to changes in our marketing programs  systems conversions and vendor reliability 
however  management believes that these investments should ultimately position the company for substantial growth 
increase in net sales the company s net sales increased million  or  to million for from million in and increased million  or  in from million in in  the sales increase came from the new catalogs  linda anderson  linda anderson s collectibles and snoopy  etc 
sales from our largest catalog  colorful images  declined in as compared to primarily because fewer catalogs were circulated to prospects and customer response rates were lower to certain mailings 
the increases in sales in resulted primarily from the distribution of a greater number of catalogs and other advertising media  increased page count of the catalogs and a greater number of products offered 
gift  home decor and other merchandise products increased as a percentage of total sales from in to in to in these increases occurred primarily because of the advertising and sale of a greater number of gift  home decor and other merchandise items as a percentage of total products advertised and sold 
sales from the new catalogs are almost exclusively gift  home decor and other merchandise items 
cost of product and delivery and gross profit cost of product and delivery as a percentage of sales was in  as compared to in and in gross profit increased by  or  to million in from million in and increased million  or  in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in the decrease in gross profit in and resulted primarily from increased sales of gift  home decor and other merchandise items  which generally have higher product costs as a percentage of sales than personalized paper products 
in  and  personalized paper product costs were less than of sales price compared to gift and merchandise products whose costs were in excess of of sales price 
in addition  but to a lesser degree  higher fixed costs of operations contributed to the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales 
these higher fixed costs included facility and equipment costs  both of which are higher due to the move in the third quarter of to our new facilities and the new equipment acquired at that time 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in and increased million  or  in from million in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were in  in and in the increase in resulted primarily from the more than increase in circulation of the new catalogs in as compared to  increased creative costs associated with the development of the new catalogs  higher fixed general and administrative costs including additional merchandise and creative personnel hired to produce the new catalogs and decreased response rates from colorful images prospecting efforts 
the increase in primarily related to increased paper costs in the last quarter of the fiscal year and a higher level of prospect marketing in as compared to prospect marketing generally has higher marketing costs as a percentage of sales than customer marketing because customers tend to respond to marketing offers better than prospects 
other income expense other income expense  consisting primarily of interest expense  interest income and vendor payment discounts  was an expense of  for  and income of  for and  for an increase in interest expense was the most significant cause of the expense for interest expense was  for   for and  for the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the financing of the company s new facilities 
income taxes the company had an income tax benefit of  in and provision for income taxes of  in and  in the income tax rate in was approximately and the income tax rate in was approximately 
these income tax rates were lower than the statutory federal and state tax rates  because of the availability of certain state income tax credits 
the income tax rate in was approximately which was lower than the statutory rate  because of the availability of research and development credits 
management anticipates the income tax rate in will be approximately 
seasonality company sales have certain seasonal fluctuations that primarily relate to the purchasing patterns of individual consumers and increased levels of advertising 
these patterns tend to concentrate sales in the latter half of the year  particularly during the christmas season 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of sales occurred in the last three months of the year 
the net earnings of any interim quarter are usually seasonally disproportionate to net sales since administrative and certain operating expenses remain relatively constant during the year 
although the company s product mix has changed significantly during the last three years  prices for the company s products have not increased significantly 
outlook the company intends to continue its strategy of developing several catalog vehicles and related marketing efforts 
currently management anticipates that linda anderson will begin to produce a positive contribution to profitability during but both linda anderson s collectibles and snoopy  etc 
are still in the developmental stage 
in  management plans to be less aggressive with prospecting efforts for linda anderson and linda anderson s collectibles and to set limits on expenditures associated with prospecting 
these actions should reduce the negative financial impact of these catalogs on profitability but may also slow the rate of revenue and database growth 
we also plan to develop more niche catalogs or marketing efforts similar to snoopy  etc 
which will focus on specific groups of prospective customers 
while in the developmental stage  these niche offerings may also produce some of the same effects on margins seen in colorful images is our most mature catalog 
colorful images experienced some contribution reduction in during we attempted to mail two different versions of the catalog 
early test successes did not hold up when the catalog was mailed in higher volumes 
in  we plan to mail one version of the catalog to customers and prospects at a reduced frequency as compared to this reduction in frequency of contact may reduce revenues from colorful images in but should result in increased profitability contribution 
during the fourth quarter of  the company successfully avoided backorder problems that had occurred in prior years  but inventory levels increased significantly over historic levels 
during  the company intends to make efforts to reduce the level of inventories by employing such measures as liquidation and returns to vendors 
however  in the future as the company s merchandise mix includes more gift  home decor and other merchandise items  the company s investment in such inventory may need to increase above historic levels and the company will need to plan to contain levels of excess inventory 
during the last half of  the company began a significant e commerce infrastructure development effort 
during the second quarter of  the company currently plans to complete first phase infrastructure development and begin launching e sites  including sites specific to certain of its catalogs and sites that offer brand or catalog related merchandise and services 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased by  in  increased by  in and increased by  in activity in several significant areas had the greatest impact on cash and cash equivalents as described below 
a decrease in the number of catalogs distributed near the end of the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in  and reduced costs incurred for distribution of a lesser number of catalogs in the first quarter of as compared to the same period in were the primary factors resulting in a  decrease in deferred advertising costs in increased advertising over levels  the forward buying of approximately million of paper for catalogs  the distribution of a greater number of catalogs and the distribution of a significant number of catalogs near the end of the fourth quarter of and very early in january were the primary factors in the increase of deferred advertising by  in the increase in inventories of  in primarily related to increased inventory purchasing to avoid backorder problems and the increase in sales as a percentage of total company sales of the gift  home decor and other merchandise items which generally have higher unit cost than paper products 
the increases of inventories of  in related primarily to increased sales 
the decrease in accounts payable of  in related primarily to the timing of payment of advertising costs and inventories 
the increase in accounts payable of  in and  in primarily related to the incurring of significant advertising costs for january mailings of the subsequent year and timing of payments for inventory 
improvement in inventory backorder and fulfillment function efficiency were the main factors in a decrease of customer liabilities primarily unshipped customer orders and reserve for future customer warranty costs and product returns in by  during the fourth quarter of  the increase in customer liabilities of  related primarily to an increase in customer order backlog caused by inventory backorder and a lack of capacity in certain fulfillment functions 
the net loss of   contributed significantly to the decrease in cash in and net income of  and  in and  respectively  contributed significantly to increased cash in these years 
significant items of investment of cash during the periods were purchases of property and equipment of   and  in  and  respectively  and the use of  to collateralize a letter of credit during the purchases related primarily to purchases of software and assets relative to development of e commerce infrastructure 
the purchases of property and equipment related primarily to the purchase of undeveloped land and costs of a newly constructed facility that the company moved into in the third quarter of the purchases during related primarily to computer equipment  order fulfillment equipment and furniture to accommodate the sales growth and expansion of the company s computer systems 
the letter of credit is related to certain obligations generally expected to be resolved within one year  in connection with improvements to the building site 
in early july  the company completed a secondary offering of million shares of its common stock 
as part of the offering  the company issued and sold  shares 
the underwriters also elected to exercise their over allotment option for  additional shares 
net proceeds from this transaction were approximately  during  the company closed on credit facilities with bank one  colorado  na bank one for long term financing on its new facility and a land development loan for the portion of property held for expansion or sale 
the company has facility mortgages of  bearing interest at a rate of  plus approximately in bank fees and  with interest at 
the land development loan is  with a variable interest rate equal to bank one s prime rate plus at december  
the company also has available through bank one a revolving line of credit for million for general purposes 
the revolving line of credit expires in may  at which time the company anticipates being able to renew the arrangement 
the  increase in debt during represented draws on these credit facilities 
the company had  of cash and cash equivalents at december  management believes that results of operations  continued operational planning review procedures  current cash balances and line of credit availability will produce funds necessary to meet its anticipated working capital requirements for the current year 
during  the company plans to incur significant cost in the development of its e commerce infrastructure  the majority of which will be capitalized 
also while the company s growth strategies primarily focus on internal development  the acquisition of existing catalogs may be considered from time to time 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and other devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing a disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  fulfill orders  or engage in similar normal business activities 
with respect to the company s information and fulfillment systems  the vendors have provided modifications for compliance by early all modification  conversions and installations are expected to be complete by mid the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if such modifications are not made or completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company believes that the risk of its having non compliant systems at the turn of the century is low 
however  to the extent that areas of risk are identified  contingency plans will be developed during to minimize their impact 
the company estimates its total cost of achieving year compliance to be less than  over the cost of normal software and equipment upgrades and replacements 
approximately  was incurred in  the remainder will be incurred in the company has initiated formal communication with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to be year compliant 
the company has not yet discovered any major problems and to the extent that the company identifies non compliant issues  it plans to assess the level of exposure and develop contingency plans at that time 
these contingency plans are likely to include identification and confirmation of the availability of alternative suppliers 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems and infrastructure of other companies will be made compliant in a timely manner or that such failure by another company will not have an adverse effect on the company 
because most of the company s customers are individual consumers  the company does not expect year issues to materially affect its customers as a group 
the cost of the project and date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct relevant systems and similar uncertainties 
forward looking statements the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the act provide companies with a safe harbor when making forward looking statements 
this safe harbor encourages companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation 
company statements that are not historical facts  including statements about management s expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives for fiscal year and beyond and about year issues  are forward looking statements as such term is defined in the act and involve various risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from management s projections  forecasts  estimates and expectations include  but are not limited to  the following changes in postal rates or the cost of paper  changes in the general economic conditions of the united states leading to increased competitive activity and changes in consumer spending generally or specifically with reference to the types of merchandise that the company offers in its catalogs  changes in the company s merchandise product mix or changes in the company s customer response to advertising offers  competitive factors including name recognition and the company s relative newness to the mail order catalog business  lack of availability access to capital or sources of supply for appropriate inventory  lack of effective performance of third party suppliers with respect to production and distribution of catalogs  state tax issues relating to the taxation of out of state mail order companies with neither sales representatives nor outlets in a particular state seeking to impose sales and similar taxes  lack of effective performance of third parties supplying year solutions to the company  lack of effective performance of customer service and the company s order fulfillment system  lack of effective performance of the company s e commerce infrastructure and retailing sites  and changes in strategy and timing related to testing and rollout of new catalogs and those catalogs still in the test stage of development
