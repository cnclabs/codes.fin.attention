as discussed herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company took a significant charge to earnings as a result of these changes in accounting policies and methodologies 
most of these charges were non cash accounting adjustments  in and of themselves  these changes had no direct effect on the company s capital  liquidity or cash flow 
redwood trust earnings for the fourth quarter of were million and earnings per share were 
relative to the fourth quarter of  net income increased by and earnings per share increased by 
this strong increase in quarterly earnings per share was due to an increase in net interest income from reit portfolio operations  a gain on sale of mortgage loans  and a reduction in the number of common shares outstanding due to company share repurchases

in  mortgage prepayment rates accelerated as homeowners refinanced their mortgages in record numbers 
this acceleration was the primary reason the company reported a loss in prepayment acceleration had two negative impacts on earnings 
first  prepayment acceleration caused a decline in the market value of the company s assets 
this reduction in market value was recognized as a reduction in earnings under the mark to market accounting methodologies the company adopted in the third quarter of for the majority of its assets 
second  accelerated mortgage prepayment rates increased mortgage premium amortization expenses 
financial markets went through a period of turmoil and reduced liquidity in the second half of the company entered the liquidity crisis with a strong balance sheet  a strong liquidity position  a significant portion of its borrowings in the form of non recourse long term debt  and relatively modest effective leverage 
as a result  the company was largely unaffected by the liquidity crisis except to the extent which earnings were reduced by mark to market adjustments as the market values of portfolio assets fell during the crisis 
the company s common stock price declined in to a level below tangible book value per share 
because of its strong balance sheet position  the company was able to enhance liquidity for selling shareholders and enhance value for remaining shareholders through its common stock repurchase program 
the company repurchased of its outstanding common stock in the company s core strategy since its founding in has been to become a highly productive and efficient investor in mortgage loan portfolios 
as part of this strategy  the company developed mortgage loan production and securitization operations designed to manufacture attractive mortgage loan investments and credit enhancement opportunities for the company s portfolio and to use its balance sheet to create mortgage backed bonds for sale to investors 
in  the company contributed its loan production operations to rwt holdings  inc holdings 
the company is funding the expansion of holdings loan production operations to enable holdings to efficiently manufacture mortgage investments for sale to all mortgage investors  including the company s reit portfolio 
this expansion of the company s strategy is designed to generate fee income to compliment the net interest income earned from mortgage portfolio operations 
this expansion should also give the company s reit portfolio significant additional opportunities to acquire attractive mortgage assets 
in addition  asset quality control for the portfolio will be enhanced  as investments will be produced by the company s affiliate 
holdings has three new subsidiaries 
each subsidiary sources mortgage loans for aggregation and subsequent re sale to mortgage investors as loan portfolios or as mortgage securities 
redwood financial services  inc buys and sells seasoned loan portfolios and other mortgage assets with banks and thrifts as their primary customer 
redwood residential funding  inc acquires newly originated residential loans from mortgage bankers and sells them as loans or securities to a variety of institutional investors 
redwood commercial funding  inc originates small balance commercial mortgages for sale to banks and other finance companies 
more generally  each of these units is prepared to both buy and sell mortgage assets from and to its client base within its area of product expertise 
collectively  these companies are capable of buying or selling almost any type of high quality mortgage loan in a professional manner  and adding value to the process through their operations 
the company believes that each of holdings new businesses has the potential to generate a return on equity equal to or greater than the return on equity generated by the company s reit portfolio operations 
however  these new businesses are all in their start up phases so additional operating loses will occur in prior to these business generating such profits 
these losses will be reflected in the company s income statements 
furthermore  the company plans to allocate an increasing percentage of its capital to holdings mortgage production businesses during to free capital for holdings  the company plans to reduce the size of its reit mortgage portfolio 
as a result  earnings potential from the reit portfolio will decline even if reit portfolio margins remain healthy 
overall company profitability will likely be reduced until holdings new businesses achieve their profitability targets

in  the company paid million common stock dividends  or per share 
the company was not required under the minimum reit dividend distribution rules to declare a common stock dividend in the third and fourth quarters of  so no such dividend was declared 
while the company had more than ample liquidity and balance sheet strength to pay a dividend in those quarters  the company chose to retain its capital to use for its operations and its common stock repurchase program 
risk management market risks the company s market risks include changes in market valuations  changes in net interest income  liquidity risk  prepayment risk  credit risk and others 
management s discussion and selected information on these risks is included in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k 
liquidity in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into several new short term borrowing commitments with higher haircuts and higher spreads between the cost of these borrowings and libor rates than typically had been the case in the past 
in addition  in at least one instance  a short term lender to the company indicated that  due to their own internal issues  they would not be able to renew certain borrowings as they became due  the company met its financing needs with other lenders 
these were symptoms of the nationwide liquidity crunch which impacted financial markets in general  including the mortgage market and the short term lenders supplying funds to the mortgage market 
at december   the company s short term borrowings and borrowing commitments all had maturities in  mostly in the first quarter of the company s ability to roll over these borrowings as they become due depends on many factors  including any continued effects of the liquidity crunch 
if new financing is unavailable to the company  or only available with onerous terms  the company may be forced to liquidate assets 
if the spread between the cost of new financing and libor rates increases  lower earnings than would otherwise have been the case could result 
if new financings have lower advance rates higher haircuts than has typically been the case in the past  the company s liquidity reserves could be reduced or eliminated and its ability to grow and fund its business plan could be diminished 
in the first quarter of  the company extended some of its short term debt to mature in liquidity conditions generally improved in early from the fourth quarter of at december   billion of mortgage assets served as collateral for sequoia s long term debt 
the remaining mortgage assets  which had a market value of billion  were available to collateralize the company s short term debt 
the company estimates it had additional borrowing capacity in excess of its current requirements of million at year end 
in addition  the company had million of unrestricted cash 
these amounts together represented of short term borrowings at that time 
the monthly principal and interest payments received on the mortgages which serve as collateral to the long term debt are held in trust until the bond payment date and are included in the company s cash balances as restricted cash 
at december   billion of the mortgage assets served as collateral for sequoia s long term debt with the remaining billion in mortgage assets available to collateralize the company s short term debt 
the company estimates it had additional borrowing capacity in excess of its current requirements of million 
in addition  the company had million of unrestricted cash 
together  these balances equaled of short term borrowings at that time 
at december   the company had borrowings equaling of the billion market value of its mortgage assets available to collateralize such borrowings 
the company estimates it had additional borrowing capacity at that time of million  as well as million of unrestricted cash for a total balance equaling of short term borrowings at that time 
capital resources through its risk adjusted capital policy  the company assigns a guideline capital adequacy amount expressed as a guideline equity to assets ratio to each of its mortgage assets 
for short term funded assets  this ratio will fluctuate over time  based on changes in that asset s credit quality  liquidity characteristics  potential for market value fluctuation  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and the over collateralization requirements for that asset set by the company s collateralized short term lenders 
capital requirements for mortgage equity interests assets funded with long term debt generally equal the company s net investment 
the sum of the capital adequacy amounts for all of the company s mortgage assets is the company s aggregate guideline capital adequacy amount 
the total guideline equity to assets ratio capital amount has declined as the company has eliminated some of the risks of short term debt funding through the creation of mortgage equity interests by issuing long term debt 
the company does not expect that its actual capital levels will always exceed the guideline amount 
the company measures all of its mortgage assets funded with short term debt at estimated market value for the purpose of making risk adjusted capital calculations 
if interest rates were to rise in a significant manner  the company s capital guideline amount would rise as the potential interest rate risk of its mortgages would increase  at least on a temporary basis  due to periodic and life caps and slowing prepayment rates while its actual capital levels as determined for the risk adjusted capital policy would likely fall as the market values of its mortgages  net of mark to market gains on hedges  decreased market value declines may be temporary as well  as future coupon adjustments on arms may help to restore some of the lost market value 
in this circumstance  or any other circumstance in which the company s actual capital levels decreased below the company s capital adequacy guideline amount  the company would generally cease the acquisition of new mortgage assets until capital balance was restored through prepayments  interest rate changes  or other means 
in certain cases prior to a planned equity offering or other circumstances  the board of directors has authorized management to acquire mortgage assets in a limited amount beyond the usual constraints of the company s risk adjusted capital policy 
growth in assets and earnings may be limited when the company s access to new equity capital is limited 
holdings and the company can benefit over time from the re investment of any retained earnings at holdings 
redwood reit  however  is generally required to distribute at least of its taxable income as dividends 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates and other factors drive the company s performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the company s dividends are generally determined based on the company s net income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  the company s activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
year readiness disclosure in  redwood trust established a year project 
the goal of this on going project is to ensure that its communications  data and information systems are ready for the year and to employ prudent management to minimize any potential negative impact of the year on the company s business partners and its investors 
senior management has taken an active role in the year project and provides updates to the company s board of directors as necessary 
this update and disclosure pertain to redwood trust  inc and its affiliates  though it is not universally applicable 
our definition of readiness for the year includes testing of our internal systems hardware and software to ensure that year dates are retained and correctly roll from december  to january  and from february  to february  to march  it also includes having an enterprise wide contingency and disaster recovery plan for any known year issues and to the extent possible  other unforeseeable circumstances 
our project management strategies include system risk assessment  system upgrades or workarounds  and contingency planning 
the company believes it is devoting the necessary resources to address all appropriate year issues 
the company does not anticipate incurring costs related to the year issue that would be material to its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in future periods 
the company commenced operations within the past five years and has built its internal systems on a client server model 
thus  we are not aware of any internal legacy computer systems or software issues 
in the third quarter of  internal computer systems were successfully tested 
hardware testing included forward date testing of the december  to january  rollover and leap year critical software applications  used to manage the company s businesses  were also successfully tested 
as systems are modified or new hardware or software systems are implemented in the normal course of business  the company s policy is to receive certification of year compliance and to test for year compliance upon installation 
the company continues to gather and assess information of its business partners yk readiness 
we will monitor public disclosures by key business partners into the new year and solicit disclosures directly through our own year questionnaire and subsequent discussions 
direct data collection should be substantially completed by june  business partners that provide the company information or services through externally controlled or externally coordinated systems have been identified 
joint testing of certain systems has been initiated 
external joint testing is targeted for completion by september  the company and its affiliates are developing contingency plans and workaround systems for critical systems 
workarounds may include substituting compliant business partners for those who are non compliant 
the benefit to the company of this contingency plan is likely to be limited due to the lack of the company s control on external vendors and the lack of the company s ability to replace certain business partners efficiently 
management believes the company is devoting the necessary technical and management resources to address the year issues over which it has control 
while it is inherently difficult to assess the impact our vendors and their vendors may have on the company in the event they are unable to successfully manage their own year issues  the company believes it is on plan to reach its year project goals by october rwt holdings  inc 
rwt holdings  inc holdings was formed in delaware in february and commenced operations on april  holdings start up operations have been primarily funded by redwood  which has a significant investment in holdings preferred stock

holdings earned million in interest on its cash balances 
holdings had total interest expenses for the year of million consisting of interest expenses on short term borrowings  interest expenses on subordinated debt  and credit support fees 
net interest income totaled million operating expenses at holdings totaled million in holdings losses in were million 
each of the holdings operations is still in start up mode 
holdings currently expects these operations to become profitable in aggregate during the second half of item a 
quantatitve and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company 
at the same time  the company s endeavors to provide its shareholders an opportunity to realize an attractive total rate of return through stock ownership of the company 
the company does not seek to avoid all risks 
it does seek  to the best of its ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks it does undertake 
the company s strategy for managing some of these risks includes the use of derivative interest rate agreements 
please see note summary of significant accounting policies for additional discussions on the use of interest rate agreements and their designation as trading instruments 
interest rate risk at december   the company together with the sequoia trusts had billion adjustable rate assets and billion adjustable rate liabilities 
hybrid mortgage assets  with fixed rate coupons for to years and adjustable rate coupons thereafter  were million 
debt that had interest rate reset characteristics matched to these hybrid mortgages totaled million 
fixed rate assets were million  there were no fixed rate liabilities 
on average  the company s cost of funds had the ability to rise or fall more quickly than did the earning rate on the assets 
the risk of reduced earnings in rising interest rate environment is mitigated to some extent by the company s interest rate agreement hedging program 
at december   the company owned billion of adjustable rate mortgages with interest rates that adjust every  or months 
a majority of the company s matching debt has an interest expense that adjusts at least once per month 
as a result  the company s net income may vary somewhat as the yield curve between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies 
adjustable rate assets with earnings rates dependent on us treasury rates totaled billion at december  liabilities with a cost of funds dependent on us treasury rates totaled billion at that time 
as part of its hedging program  the company also had billion notional amount of basis swaps that  in effect  increased the company s us treasury based liabilities to billion 
at december   the company had little earnings risk with respect to the risk of us treasury rates deviating from libor market rates 
market value risk the market value of the company s assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
these fluctuations effect the company s earnings 
at december   the company and sequoia together owned mortgage securities and loans that the company accounts for on a mark to market basis including the lower of cost or market for loans totaling billion 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons and were hybrid mortgage assets 
the company s interest rate agreement hedging program may offset some asset market value fluctuations due to interest rate changes 
all of the company s billion in notional amounts of interest rate agreements are marked to market for income statement purposes 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk of the company arises from financing long maturity mortgage assets with short term debt 
although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are well matched  maturities are not matched 
the company s assets that it pledges to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over its short term debt as it matures  even during the financial market liquidity crisis of the fourth quarter of still  the company cannot give assurances that it will always be able to roll over its short term debt 
at december   the company had unrestricted cash of million 
in addition  the company had million in market value of unpledged aaa rated mortgage securities available to secure additional borrowings 
the resources the company had available to meet margin calls on short term debt that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender over collateralization requirement thus equaled million  or of short term debt 
prepayment risk as the company receives repayments of mortgage principal  it amortizes into income its mortgage premium balances as an expense and its mortgage discount balances as income 
mortgage premium balances arise when the company acquires mortgage assets at a price in excess of the principal value of the mortgages  or when an asset appreciates and is marked to market at a price above par 
mortgage discount balances arise when the company acquires mortgage assets at a price below the principal value of the mortgages  or when an asset depreciates and is marked to market at a price below par 
at december   mortgage premium balances were million and mortgage discount balances were million 
net mortgage premium was million 
long term sequoia debt had associated deferred bond issuance costs  which are amortized as an expense as the bonds are paid off with mortgage principal receipts 
these deferred costs totaled million at december  in addition  premium received upon bond issuance at prices over principal value is amortized as income as the bond issues pay down 
these balances totaled million at december  the combined effect of these two items was to reduce the company s effective mortgage related premium by million 
net premium for the company at december  for assets and liabilities effected by the rate of mortgage principal receipt was million 
this net premium equaled of total common equity 
amortization expense and income will vary as prepayment rates on mortgage assets vary 
in addition  changes in prepayment rates will effect the market value of the company s assets and its earnings 
changes in the basis of the company s assets will also affect future amortization expense 
credit risk the principal credit risk in the company comes from loans owned by sequoia  loans held in portfolio and the smfc a securities 
the company owned million in residential loans at december  of these  million  or were seriously delinquent 
the company also owned million in commercial loans 
these commercial loans were all current 
the three sequoia whole loan trusts owned billion in residential mortgage loans at december  the company s total credit risk from these trusts is limited to its equity investment in these trusts 
these investments had a reported value of million 
at year end  million of these loans  or  were seriously delinquent 
at december   the company had million credit reserves and million mark to market credit reserves to provide for potential future credit losses from company and sequoia loans 
total credit related reserves were million and total seriously delinquent loans were million 
at december   the company had million credit reserves for its smfc a mortgage securities 
the company s total potential credit exposure from these securities after this credit reserve was million 
tabular presentation the information presented in the table below includes all the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets  funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities and also acquires interest rate sensitive derivative financial instruments 
the company designates some of these assets as trading and others as non trading 
the designation of an asset as trading does not necessarily imply that the company has a short term intended holding period for that asset 
the table below includes information about the possible future repayments and interest rates of company s assets and liabilities and constitutes a forward looking statement 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as assumed or that other events will occur that would affect the outcomes 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions  calls  and restructurings could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
for interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of maturity 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of markets as of december  was used to project the average interest rates for each year  based on the existing characteristics of the portfolio 
the maturity of cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance  actual prepayment speeds will vary 
as of december   all short term interest rate sensitive liabilities were scheduled to mature in the balance of long term interest rate sensitive liabilities is amortized with the receipt of principal payments from the mortgages securing such debt 
thus  long term liability maturities are presented based on the principal maturities of the underlying mortgages at assumed prepayment rates 
weighted average interest rates for the year are based on the forward curve and the characteristics of such debt 
information presented on derivative financial instruments includes the notional amounts of such instruments by maturity date and the effective strike  pay or receive rates by the year in which instruments mature 
for those instruments with a variable rate component  the applicable average forward rates for the term of the contract are provided 
the information includes all of the company s derivative instruments owned as of december   regardless of whether they were effective at december  or were scheduled to become effective at a later date
