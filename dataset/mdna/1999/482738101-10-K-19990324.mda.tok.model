item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview kvh industries  inc the company derives its revenues from sensor products and systems sold to a range of commercial  military and oem markets in the communications and navigation industries 
the company s products include stabilized antenna systems for mobile satellite applications such as voice  fax and data transmission and television reception  positional and heading systems for tactical military applications in amphibious and land vehicles and for commercial applications in land vehicles  digital compasses and instrument systems for recreational  commercial and military applications  and embedded fiber optic sensors 
the company s in house sales and marketing groups have established a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors to market the company s products 
the majority of the company s sales  product distribution and customer service is conducted at the company s headquarters in middletown  rhode island  and the european market is managed through the company s subsidiary in hoersholm  denmark 
the company s manufacturing process consists primarily of light assembly and final test  which is conducted at its facilities in middletown  rhode island  and tinley park  illinois 
there was a notable impact on sales in as the company completed its first full fiscal year following a strategic marketing shift towards direct sales with repeat orders and away from dependence upon large  one time oem sales 
the company implemented the new strategy in mid to replace the significant revenue fluctuations caused by non recurring large sales  particularly of its sensor based products for communications applications  with repeat sales that would provide a more consistent revenue stream 
a decrease in military orders during was related to customary funding procedures that commonly cause periodic sales fluctuations in the defense industry 
fiber optic gyro fog sales did not meet internal expectations  primarily because the company withdrew its cps tm based busnav tm system from the mass transportation market when the cost of supplying full service support to customers buying product at oem prices became financially counter productive 
the company has determined that there are greater opportunities for cps systems in other markets such as precision agriculture  power sensors  trains and robotics 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  net sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss profit interest income  net other income  net gain loss on currency translation loss income before income tax benefit expense income tax benefit expense net loss income years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to an anticipated fluctuation in military orders and an unexpected lack of fog revenues that would have offset lower defense sales 
fog revenues were adversely affected by kvh s decision to remove its cps products from the bus navigation market and focus on other markets that the company believes have significantly more sales potential 
product sales were million in and million in with customer funded research at million in both and communications revenues increased in to million from million in as strong growth in direct sales of turnkey mobile satellite systems continued to supplant previous non recurring oem sales 
navigation sales were million in compared to million in  a decrease attributable to a decline in high margin military contracts that adversely affected gross profits 
fiber optic sensor sales constituted million or of navigation revenues 
this compares to fiber optic revenues of million for the two month period in following the company s october acquisition of the fiber optic group assets from andrew corporation 
cost of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  material and indirect manufacturing costs and includes customer funded research and development costs of million in and million in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in due to a proportional decrease in higher margin military product sales 
in addition  fiber optic manufacturing costs exceeded fiber optic revenues to negatively impact gross margins by million 
manufacturing overheads increased to million in from million in as the company moved its fiber optic group from the former andrew corporation site to a new facility in tinley park  illinois 
excluding fiber optic facility and manufacturing costs of million  overhead would have decreased percent in from the company anticipates that cost of goods sold will be level or decrease slightly in as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies and expected sales increases in high margin military products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of direct labor and material  labor and material overhead and other direct costs associated with the company s internally funded product development efforts 
the company expenses all of its software development costs in the period incurred 
research costs increased percent to million in from million in due to costs for developing new directional antenna systems and million for fiber optic sensor integration and development 
total research and development expenditures  including customer funded product development expenditures included in cost of goods sold  were million in and million in  a increase that reflects general growth in company funded research expenditures 
the company expects ongoing growth in research and development expenses as it continues to develop advanced capability products for tactical navigation and broadband communications 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  cooperative advertising  sales literature  advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing costs grew to million in from million in major factors contributing to the growth of sales expenses were staffing  travel and new product introduction costs 
the company anticipates that sales and marketing expense will continue to grow to promote expected new product introductions 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting and human resources operations and legal and other professional services 
administrative costs increased to million in from million in  primarily due to staffing and increased professional fees related to maintaining the company s patent portfolio 
interest income 
interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash in federal short term obligations 
gain on foreign currency translation 
the results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiary  kvh europe  are determined by re measuring its foreign currency denominated operations as if they had taken place in united states dollars 
gains and losses resulting from this translation are included in the company s net income 
the translation gain increase to million in from million in reflects changes in the relative strength of the united states dollar in relation to the danish krone 
income tax benefit expense 
the company realized an income tax benefit in the amount of million in as compared with income tax expense of million in  due to the company s operating loss 
the company s effective tax rate in both years was positively affected by the utilization of state and federal research and development and investment tax credits 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased slightly to million in from million in product sales were million in both and while customer funded research was and million in and  respectively 
navigation sales grew to million in from million in navigation sales increases resulted primarily from a million or increase in navigation defense shipments 
communications sales were million in  a decrease of from million in the anticipated decreases in communication revenues reflected a large non recurring oem sale amounting to million in that was somewhat off set by direct sales of turnkey mobile satellite communications systems that increased to just under million in from million in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes customer funded research and development costs of million in and million in cost of goods sold decreased to as a percentage of net sales in from as a percentage of net sales in due to a mix shift to higher margin navigation sales 
manufacturing overheads increased to million in from million in somewhat off setting the gains in product cost of sales 
factors contributing to the manufacturing overhead increase included fiber optic sensor start up costs and a one time lease modification charge 
research and development expense 
research costs increased to million or in from million in costs of company funded product development accounted for million of the increase while fiber optic start up costs accounted for the remainder of the increase 
total research and development expenditures  including customer funded product development expenditures included in cost of goods sold  were million in and million in  reflecting the expected decline in customer funded research 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing costs grew to million or in from million in major factors contributing to the growth of sales expenses were staffing  travel and new product introduction costs 
general and administrative expense 
administrative costs increased to million or from spending of million  in response to fiber optic start up costs  increased professional fees and staffing costs 
interest income 
the proceeds of the public offering in april fully funded the company s operating and capital requirements in other income expense 
other income increased million in from primarily due to the award of a new hire training grant from the state of rhode island 
gain loss on foreign currency translation 
the translation gain of million in and the loss of million in reflect changes in the relative strength of the united states dollar in relation to the danish krone 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in income taxes was attributable to the utilization of state and federal research and development and investment tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate in was as a percentage of taxable income versus in liquidity and capital resources year ended december  change change in thousands cash and cash equivalents    working capital    the company financed its operations and fixed asset acquisitions of approximately million dollars through a combination of short term bank revolving lines of credit and the remaining proceeds from its public offering 
in january  the company borrowed approximately million pursuant to a year mortgage note agreement and mortgage on its facility at enterprise center  middletown  rhode island see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that existing cash balances  amounts available under its revolving credit facility and funds generated from the mortgage will be sufficient to meet anticipated liquidity and working capital requirements for if the company decides to expand more rapidly  to broaden or enhance its products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to remain competitive  then it may need to raise additional funds 
other matters recent accounting pronouncements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued statement of financial accounting standards number sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging  requiring recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the effect of adopting sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
year the company has evaluated the impact of the year issue as it relates to its navigation and communications products  both sold or intended to sell  and has concluded that the company s products are not affected by year operating issues 
the company has also assessed its software and computer systems ensuring that its computer software and hardware are year compliant 
the most significant element of this process is the upgrading of its enterprise resource planning system at a cost estimated at less than million  of which approximately million has been spent to date 
the company is contacting its customers  suppliers  and financial institutions  with which it does business  to ensure that any year issue is resolved 
while there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies will be year compliant  the company has no knowledge of any such third party year issues that would result in a material adverse affect on its operations 
should the company become aware of any such situation  contingency plans will be developed 
the company could be adversely affected should the company or other entities with whom the company conducts business be unsuccessful in resolving year issues in a timely manner 
the company estimates that it was complete at december   in implementing its new system and believes it will be year compliant by the first half of the company believes the cost of becoming year compliant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
forward looking statements risk factors this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made above are the following the company s products target two industries that are subject to volatility  risks and uncertainties 
the communications industry is experiencing rapid growth fueled by strong worldwide demand and buffeted by competing formats and rapid  unpredictable technology changes 
the defense industry historically experiences variability in supply and demand related to international conditions  national politics  budget decisions and technology changes  all of which are difficult or impossible to predict 
factors in both industries could affect the company s ability to effectively meet prevailing market conditions 
to position itself in these uncertain industries  the company has taken a number of steps that include  but are not limited to acquisition of the fiber optic technology and development of new related products  ongoing analysis of potential technology advances  staff reductions and reallocations  improved operational efficiencies  inventory reduction  recruiting key personnel and implementing cost controls 
there can be no assurance that the objectives of these development and cost reduction activities will be achieved 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated by management include dependence on new products and the marine mobile satellite communications market 
the company s future sales growth will depend to a considerable extent upon the successful introduction of new mobile satellite communications products for use in marine and land applications  and those introductions will be affected by a number of variables including  but not limited to market potential and penetration  reliability of outside vendors  satellite communications service providers financial abilities and products  regulatory issues  maintaining appropriate inventory levels  disparities between forecast and realized sales  and design delays and defects 
the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fog acquisition 
the additional personnel and operating expenses associated with the acquisition of fog technology and assets from andrew corporation in october added significant costs to the company s operations 
as the company continues the process of integrating fog sensors into current product offerings and identifying new  untapped markets for existing fog products  it expects fog related costs to remain level or increase 
although the company believes these opportunities show great promise  to date the company has been successful in marketing only small quantities of products and it does not anticipate that fog enhanced products will provide significant revenues for the next to months 
the company is designing its fog enhanced products to meet what it believes are customer performance and price criteria  however  at this early stage of product development and market introduction the company can provide no assurance that these objectives will be met or that competing technologies will not be developed that may supercede fog technology 
the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon all the foregoing risk factors and including the size and timing of significant orders  the ability of the company to control costs  changes in company strategy and the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
competition 
competitors in the communications market include seatel corporation  datron corporation and nera corporation  any of which could challenge the company s pricing or technology platforms 
the company s satellite phone products could be negatively impacted when iridium world communications  ltd  globalstar telecommunications ltd 
and ico global communications all offering hand held worldwide  satellite voice  data and fax services commence operations  scheduled from late through to the company may be faced with increased competition from the hitachi corporation s newly introduced closed loop fog sensor that is targeted at applications and market segments similar to those the company is pursuing 
possibility of common stock price volatility 
the trading price of the company s common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcement of new products by the company or its competitors  changes in the financial estimates by securities analysts and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market volatility that affects the market price of many high technology companies often is unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
market dynamics 
kvh s key markets for its sensors and integrated systems are particularly volatile 
in the communications industry  there are many technologies and large  well funded companies competing to provide a single source solution for broadband voice  fax  data and video access 
there are significant political  economic and business forces that are restraining near term growth and influencing how the communications consumer market ultimately will resolve such issues as technology transfers  diverse and incompatible encryption standards and the needs of underdeveloped countries 
new initiatives such as the iridium worldwide  handheld telephone system  the advent of low earth orbit leo satellites for low cost messaging and data communication and developments underway at teledesic  alcatel and motorola may pose a threat to the company s products 
in the military navigation industry where governments are the customers  defense funding  equipment focus and performance criteria are continually evolving in reaction to international politics  economic conditions and technological changes 
a number of companies in the military navigation industry have established extensive relationships with united states and foreign defense departments and have the size and capital to develop new technologies 
in the marine navigation industry  there are a number of companies competing for a portion of a relatively small market 
the company s future growth also depends upon expanding sales of its antenna aiming and navigation products 
antenna aiming systems rely upon dbs providers directv  echostar  astra and hotbird and telephony providers inmarsat and skycell 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected if any of these satellite networks experience operating  financial or regulatory problems 
revenues from communications products increased in from and the company expects continued growth in as new products penetrate the market 
sales cycles for the company s tacnav and tacnav light systems for military navigation applications are long and difficult to predict  resulting in a variable revenue stream from this market 
military revenues decreased in from and the company anticipates that revenues will remain relatively flat 
research and development efforts 
the company s future success depends on its ability to achieve technological advances that lead to marketable new products and this requires continued substantial investment in research and development 
a large portion of the company s product development strategy for the near future relies upon fogs and success in product integration  new development  marketing  increasing manufacturing capabilities  market acceptance  and the company s continued ability to fund the fiber optic effort 
prior to the acquisition of the fiber optic group from andrew corporation  the company had no experience with fiber optic manufacturing or applications and the learning and integration curve to date has taken longer than the company initially anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in achieving its fog technological and manufacturing goals or continue to have funds available for developing and marketing fiber optic products
