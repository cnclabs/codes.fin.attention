therefore  the demand for the company s services is directly related to legislative decisions about funding 
these decisions  in turn  depend on public concern with rebuilding and expanding the nation s infrastructure and addressing various environmental problems 
the company is very dependent upon the existence of these government programs and upon its ability to participate in such programs 
there is no assurance that public pressure for these programs will continue  that governments will have the available resources to fund such programs especially in light of budget constraints  that such programs will continue to be funded even if governments have available financial resources  or that the company will continue to be awarded contracts under such programs 
more than of the company s current and anticipated work is related to government contracts 
some of these contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually  so continued work by the company under these contracts in future periods is not assured 
contracts with government agencies are subject to termination for convenience by the agency 
contracts with government agencies that have adopted federal acquisition regulations are subject to an audit of actual costs incurred and provide for upward or downward adjustment of payments if audited costs differ from billed costs 
pricing risks the company s services are billed on a cost plus  fixed price  or time and materials basis 
under cost plus contracts  the rates for the company s direct and indirect costs are negotiated and fixed before work commences 
under fixed price contracts  the entire contract price is fixed before work commences 
frequently  the company submits proposals on extremely complex projects to be performed over several years  which makes the accurate forecasting of costs very difficult 
in the past  the company experienced low profit margins or losses on certain of both its cost plus and fixed price contracts because overhead and general and administrative costs were excessive and could not be factored into contract proposals 
the company subsequently reduced its overhead and general and administrative costs 
however  to the extent the company does not control overhead  general and administrative and other costs  or underestimates such costs  the company may have low profit margins  or may incur losses 
environmental and professional liability exposure  adequacy of insurance coverage the company s business involves the planning  design and program and construction management of a wide variety of complex projects 
if problems develop with these projects  either while under construction or after they have been completed  claims may be made against the company alleging breach of contract or negligence in the performance of its professional services 
in addition  the company s professional services involve the planning  design and program and construction management of waste management and pollution control facilities 
federal laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  and various state and local laws  strictly regulate the handling  removal  treatment and transportation of toxic and hazardous substances and impose liability for environmental contamination caused by such substances 
moreover  so called toxic tort litigation has increased markedly in recent years as those injured by hazardous substances seek recovery for personal injuries or property damage under common law theories 
while the company does not directly handle  remove  treat or transport toxic or hazardous substances  some of the company s contracts require the company to design systems for those functions or to subcontract for or supervise such work 
the company may therefore be exposed to claims for damages caused by environmental contamination arising from projects on which the company has worked 
the company currently maintains an insurance program which includes insurance coverage for primary professional liability and errors and omissions e o claims and environmental impairment liability claims  excess e o coverage  and both primary and excess comprehensive general liability insurance coverage  all up to specified coverage limits and with a variety of standard exclusions 
while the company believes that its insurance program currently is adequate  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain its existing insurance coverage  that insurance coverage will be available under the company s existing or previous insurance programs with respect to claims made against the company  or that claims will not exceed the amount of any insurance coverage which is available 
various legal proceedings are pending against the company or its subsidiaries alleging breaches of contract or negligence in connection with the performance of professional services 
in some actions punitive or treble damages are sought which substantially exceed the company s insurance coverage 
the company s management does not believe that any of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position and operations of the company 
attraction and retention of qualified professionals whether the company can retain and expand its staff of qualified technical professionals will help determine the company s future success 
there can be shortages of qualified technical professionals in various fields 
the market for engineering and environmental professionals is competitive and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such professionals 
in addition  the company relies heavily upon the experience and ability of its senior executive staff and the loss of a significant portion of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
principal stockholders  concentration of stock ownership a significant portion of the company s common stock is held by a small number of institutional investors 
rcba is the sole general partner of richard c 
blum associates  lp rcba  which  as the sole general partner or the investment advisor to certain entities  has voting and dispositive control with respect to an aggregate of  shares of common stock  or approximately of the outstanding common stock 
richard c 
blum  vice chairman of the board of directors of the company  is the majority stockholder of rcba and directly owns  shares of common stock  is the beneficiary of a keogh plan which holds  shares of common stock  and holds options to purchase  shares of common stock  all of which are currently exercisable 
in addition  heartland advisors  inc and fmr corp 
hold an aggregate of  shares of common stock  or approximately of the outstanding common stock 
a sale by one or more institutional investors of their common stock could materially adversely affect its market price 
a significant decline in the price of the common stock due to these or other factors might make it more difficult for the company to sell equity securities or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that the company deems appropriate 
volatility  market for the shares the company s common stock is listed for trading on the new york stock exchange and the pacific exchange 
the stock has been thinly traded  which may have caused substantial fluctuations in its market price 
fluctuations in quarterly financial results and general economic conditions such as recessions or high interest rates may also cause the market price of the stock to fluctuate substantially 
competition the architectural and engineering services industry is highly fragmented and very competitive 
as a result  in each specific market area  the company competes with many engineering and consulting firms  several of which are substantially larger than the company and which possess greater financial resources 
competition is based upon reputation  quality of service  price  expertise and local presence 
year compliance generally 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in the computer shutting down or performing incorrect computations 
as a result  before december   computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company s year issues  state of readiness 
year issues which may affect the company fall into two basic categories business disruption issues 
in certain situations  a year problem could interfere with the operation of the company s business 
for example  a year problem could adversely impact a the company s ability to interface with third parties  such as receiving payments from clients or supplies from vendors on a timely basis  b the reliability of the company s internal information management systems  such as accounting systems  or c the physical operation of systems used by the company which have embedded technology  such as elevator and telephone systems  security systems and other physical office infrastructure 
such business disruption issues could arise from internal year problems in software used by the company or from external year problems encountered by third parties 
the company has commenced a year compliance program to address such issues third party interfaces the company is discussing with its clients and vendors the potential impact the year issue will have on their systems  including possible delays in receiving payment from clients resulting from year problems affecting such clients accounting and payables systems 
as the company assesses these issues  it expects to develop contingency plans against such payment delays and other year problems which may include  for example  holding additional cash reserves 
internal information systems the company has completed an inventory of its internal hardware and software and is currently performing a year readiness assessment and impact analysis for these systems 
year issues for many of the company s critical internal information systems have been or are being addressed as part of the previously planned upgrade of such systems following the company s acquisition of w c 
for example  the company believes that its e mail software is currently year compliant and anticipates that in the near future its upgraded company wide accounting and financial reporting system and its payroll and human resources system will be year compliant 
embedded technology systems the company currently is examining infrastructure issues on an office by office basis 
as the company renegotiates its office leases or enters into new leases  it is incorporating language designed to protect the company against potential business interruption stemming from year problems 
the company expects to develop contingency plans to address any such embedded technology issues as they are identified 
client deliverables 
a limited number of projects undertaken by the company include the specification of computer based components as part of the work delivered to clients  and an even fewer number of projects involve the actual development of software and hardware 
the company is implementing a plan of action related to such client deliverables  which includes developing an inventory of affected projects and contacting affected clients and offering assistance with their year compliance issues 
however  because the company generally has not manufactured or designed this hardware or software  it anticipates that the responsibility for any year problems associated with these deliverables ultimately will rest with the hardware or software manufacturer 
the company also has drafted contract clauses to address year issues which have been distributed to all officers with contracting authority for insertion in the company s future client contracts 
costs 
the company has not incurred substantial incremental costs in connection with its year compliance programs 
for example  the company has been working on integrating its internal information management systems after the acquisition of w c regardless of the year issue and did not accelerate the replacement of such systems due to year compliance issues 
the company has  however  devoted internal resources and hired some external resources to assist with the implementation and monitoring of its year compliance programs 
such costs are not significant 
risks 
at this time  the company does not anticipate that costs of its year compliance program or the risks to the company which might arise from the year problem are likely to be material 
however  because the company has no control over third parties products or services  the company cannot ensure year compliance by third parties 
problems encountered by the company s clients and vendors arising from the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the company s plans to address the year issue are not successfully or timely implemented  the company may need to devote more resources to the process and additional costs may be incurred  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the costs of the company s year compliance programs and the timetable on which the company plans to complete such programs are based on management s best estimates  and reflect assumptions regarding the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the compliance plans of third parties and similar uncertainties 
however  due to the complexity and pervasiveness of the year issue  and in particular the uncertainty regarding the compliance programs of third parties  no assurance can be given that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
