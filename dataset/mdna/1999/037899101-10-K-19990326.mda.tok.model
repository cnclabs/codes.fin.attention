new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for the company for periods beginning in fiscal year the company believes that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on its financial statements  based on current activities 
impact of the year the year will have a broad impact on the business environment in which the company operates due to the possibility that many computer systems across all industries will be unable to process information containing dates beginning in the year the company has established a team to assess risk  identify and correct exposures when possible  and develop contingency plans for year compliance issues 
this team has conducted a detailed assessment of its accounting  finance  operational and other systems in order to identify and address potential issues relating to the year systems that are not compliant will be modified or replaced with systems that are year compliant 
the team is also responsible for identifying and investigating the year readiness of critical suppliers  franchisees and other third parties  and for developing contingency plans where necessary 
key systems have been inventoried and assessed for compliance  and detailed plans are in place for required system modifications or replacements 
remediation and testing activities are well underway with approximately of the systems already compliant 
the company expects to be fully compliant by the end of the third quarter of inventories and assessments of non information technology non it systems were completed during remediation of substantially all non it systems began in the fourth quarter of with a mid year target completion date 
progress toward remediation programs is also monitored by senior management and periodically reported to the company s board of directors 
questionnaires have been sent to substantially all of the company s suppliers to obtain reasonable assurance that plans are being developed to address the year issue 
risk assessments and contingency plans  where necessary  will be finalized in the first half of to the extent that vendors do not provide the company with satisfactory evidence of their readiness to handle year issues  contingency plans will be developed to obtain qualified replacement vendors 
information has also been provided to all franchisees regarding the potential risks associated with year compliance 
contingency plans for year related interruptions that are critical to the ongoing operation of the business are being developed and will include  but not be limited to  the development of emergency backup and recovery procedures  remediation of existing systems parallel with installation of new systems  replacement of electronic applications with manual processes  and identification of alternate suppliers 
all contingency plans are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of however  no contingency plans are being developed for the availability of key public services and utilities 
the company s year efforts are ongoing and its overall plan  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
while the company anticipates no major interruption of its business activities  that will be dependent  in part  upon the ability of third parties  particularly franchisees  to be year compliant 
although the company has implemented the actions described above to address third party issues  it has no direct ability to influence the compliance actions by such outside parties 
accordingly  while the company believes its actions in this regard should have the effect of minimizing year risks  it is unable to eliminate them or to estimate the ultimate effect year risks will have on the company s operating results 
the company believes that its significant systems are generally year compliant  and the costs associated with such compliance have not had  and will not have  a material impact on the company s results of operations 
this assumes that the company will not incur significant year related costs on behalf of its suppliers  franchisees or other third parties 
the estimated total cost of the company s year efforts is approximately  the total amount expended through december  was approximately  and the estimated costs to be incurred in fiscal year are approximately  these amounts include the costs of external consultants  the purchase of software and hardware  and the compensation of internal employees working on year projects 
all estimated costs have been budgeted and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations 
forward looking statements the statements contained herein regarding restaurant development  capital expenditures and the impact of the year are forward looking and based on current expectations
