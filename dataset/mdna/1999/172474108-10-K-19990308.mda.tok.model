cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the companies cinergy  a delaware corporation  is a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
cinergy was created in the october merger of the cincinnati gas electric company cg e and psi resources  inc cinergy is the parent holding company of psi energy  inc 
psi  cg e  cinergy investments  inc investments  cinergy global resources  inc global resources  and cinergy services  inc 
services 
psi is a public utility primarily engaged in providing electric service in north central  central  and southern indiana 
cg e is a public utility primarily engaged in providing electric and gas service in the southwestern portion of ohio and through its subsidiaries in adjacent areas in kentucky and indiana 
cg e s principal subsidiary  the union light  heat and power company ulh p  is an operating utility primarily engaged in providing electric and gas service in northern kentucky 
investments holds virtually all of cinergy s domestic non utility businesses and interests 
global resources  formed in  holds cinergy s international businesses and certain other interests 
services provides cinergy companies with a variety of administrative  management  and support services 
cinergy conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates 
the company is functionally organized into four business units through which many of its activities are conducted energy commodities business unit ecbu  energy delivery business unit edbu  energy services business unit esbu  and the international business unit ibu 
the traditional  vertically integrated utility functions have been realigned into the ecbu  edbu  and esbu 
as the industry continues its evolution  cinergy will continually analyze its operating structure and make adjustments as appropriate 
in early  certain organizational changes were begun to further align the business units to reflect cinergy s strategic vision 
reference is made to note of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion on financial information by business unit as of december  financial condition competitive pressures electric utility industry cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p introduction the electric utility industry is continuing to transition from a monopoly cost of service regulated environment to an industry in which companies will ultimately compete to be the retail customers energy provider 
this transition will continue to impact the operations  structure  and profitability of cinergy 
energy companies are positioning themselves for full competition through the pursuit of mergers and acquisitions  strategic alliances  and the development of energy products and services 
cinergy s success in this transition is in large part dependent on legislative and regulatory outcomes with respect to electricity deregulation in its three franchise states ohio  indiana  and kentucky  as well as other regions in the us where cinergy chooses to compete in the retail and wholesale markets 
restructuring process wholesale markets the wholesale electric markets have been open to competition since when the ferc issued orders and these rules provided for mandatory filing of open access comparability transmission tariffs  functional unbundling of all services  utilities use of these filed tariffs for their own bulk power transactions  establishment of an electronic bulletin board for transmission availability and pricing information  and establishment of a contract based approach to recover stranded investments as a result of customer choice at the wholesale level 
competitors within the wholesale market include traditional utilities and non utility competitors such as exempt wholesale generators ewgs  independent power producers  and power marketers 
cinergy  through its ecbu  is involved in wholesale power marketing and trading 
during late june  midwestern wholesale electric power markets experienced unprecedented price volatility due to several factors  including unseasonably hot weather  unplanned generating unit outages  transmission constraints  and defaults by certain power marketers on their supply obligations 
the simultaneous occurrence of these events resulted in temporary but extreme price spikes in the midwestern electricity markets 
during this period  cinergy s subsidiaries met both their statutory obligation to serve retail franchise customers and contractual obligations with wholesale customers 
since the events of june  the midwestern markets have continued to experience price volatility and illiquidity 
for further discussion  see the market risk sensitive instruments and positions section herein 
during  the new york mercantile exchange nymex began trading contracts with delivery points located in the midwest and southern regions of the country 
cinergy s transmission system is the delivery point for the midwest region and one of only four nymex delivery points in the us 
retail markets regulation and the transition to competition at the retail ie  end user level currently remains under the jurisdiction of individual states 
see state developments for a discussion on the current status of customer choice in each of cinergy s franchise states 
in most states where restructuring legislation has been enacted  all customers have been given the right to choose an electricity supplier 
the incumbent utility has retained the right and obligation to provide the distribution and transmission of electricity  which continues to remain a regulated service 
significant issues facing state legislators  regulators  and incumbent franchise utilities in the restructuring to a competitive retail market include o the responsibility for unrecovered costs of the utilities in excess of the amounts which would be recovered under competitive market prices and the mechanism to recover these costs 
o the period allowed for transition to full competition 
o the extent to which incumbent utilities continue to have the obligation to serve during the transition period  or in the alternative  the extent to which competitive bidding for existing franchise customers is required or allowed 
o default supplier responsibility following the transition period and the compensation for the associated risk 
o the extent to which utilities are granted the flexibility to position themselves for competition during the transition period  including the right to sell assets and retain the proceeds from such sales 
o resolution of potential market power issues either through forced divestiture of generation and or participation in a regional transmission organization 
o the need for a power exchange or similar mechanism to establish a market clearing price 
o codes of conduct regarding the separation of the monopoly and non monopoly functions of a utility and the treatment of affiliate transactions 
o restructuring of state tax laws applicable to utilities necessitated by the disproportionate allocation of state tax liability to public utilities 
the anticipated restructuring of retail electric markets will create risks as well as opportunities for utilities  eg  the risks and opportunities arising from the termination of the regulated fuel adjustment clause  which provides protection against escalation in fuel and purchased power costs 
additionally  a number of implementation issues  including enhancements or replacements to existing customer information and billing systems  will be required 
cinergy will continue to focus on reducing costs and maintaining its status as a low cost provider of electricity as well as identifying and addressing the likely implementation issues associated with retail customer choice 
additionally  cinergy will continue to execute its strategy of developing and offering a portfolio of energy products and services for the retail market 
cinergy continues to be an advocate of competition in retail electricity markets and continues to pursue customer choice legislation at both the state and federal levels 
cinergy believes that the transition to competition can best meet the interests of all stakeholders where the rules are prescribed to the fullest extent possible in legislation that embodies the following o price freezes that provide an opportunity for the utility to recover its transition costs and provide immediate flexibility for the utility to restructure its portfolio of supply assets in preparation for competition  keeping any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of assets to offset transition costs 
o a transition period with choice immediately available to all 
during this period customers can adapt to the rights and responsibilities associated with choosing an alternative electricity supplier 
o mitigation of market power issues through participation in a large  regional transmission organization 
o adequate recovery of regulatory assets 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p state developments at present  a number of states have enacted legislation that will lead to complete retail electric competition over the next several years 
these states generally have required up front rate reductions and the opportunity for all customer classes to choose an electricity provider in return for recovery of utility stranded costs  including the ability to securitize revenue streams associated with such stranded costs 
every state that has passed legislation has included a mechanism for the recovery of some stranded investment 
however  states have varied on the methodology to be applied in determining the level of stranded investment  with divestiture of generating assets being one such method 
as discussed below  the three states in which cinergy operates electric utilities are in various stages of addressing customer choice 
none of these states has yet passed legislation  but policymakers and stakeholders continue to work to resolve the issues 
cinergy and psi indiana customer choice legislation was introduced in the indiana general assembly in by a coalition of customer organizations and two investor owned utilities ious  including cinergy 
after hearing and consideration by a senate committee  the bill was defeated in the full senate 
legislation proposed by a group of large industrial customers was introduced in january at present  cinergy continues to work with ious in indiana and other stakeholders to develop customer choice legislation that can be enacted into law in indiana 
the outcome of this effort is uncertain 
cinergy and cg e ohio electric restructuring legislation was introduced in the ohio legislature during this legislation  companion electric restructuring bills sb and hb  proposed to afford choice to all retail electric customers in ohio beginning january  neither bill was passed during the legislative session 
during the third quarter of  ohio s ious  including cg e  released a draft bill that sets forth the utilities proposed approach to comprehensive electric restructuring in ohio 
under the ious proposal  choice to all retail electric customers would be introduced by january  rates would be frozen during a transition period  a fixed charge for certain transition costs would continue after the freeze period for a set time  and customers would be provided a market based shopping credit to stimulate the development of a competitive market 
the proposal also included a restructuring of the tax laws with respect to electric utilities 
in january  a place holder bill was introduced in both the house and senate 
these bills set forth a legislative intent to develop comprehensive electric restructuring legislation in ohio during key policymakers in the state continue to meet with the ious and other stakeholders to see whether compromise legislation can be developed 
it is uncertain whether this effort will produce legislation in ohio in cinergy  cg e  and ulh p kentucky house joint resolution  which required the formation of an executive task force comprised of members from the governor s office and the kentucky general assembly to further study electric restructuring  was passed by the kentucky general assembly and signed by the governor in april task force members will study electric restructuring in anticipation of the next legislative session  which occurs in january cinergy united kingdom transition to full competition in the united kingdom s uk electric utility industry began with the industry s privatization in as a result of the transition plan  larger users of electricity have been free to choose their supplier since as early as in september  a phase in of choice for all remaining customers commenced and is to be completed by march the power suppliers sell power into a pool from which regional electric companies recs purchase power for their customers through the supply segment of their business 
midlands electricity plc midlands is one of twelve recs in the uk 
in november  midlands entered into an agreement to sell its power supply business to one of the uk s primary power generation companies 
the sale is contingent upon uk government and regulatory approvals 
midlands power supply business purchases  markets  and supplies electricity to million customers in the uk 
after the sale  midlands will continue to own and operate its electric distribution business  which will remain regulated by the office of electricity regulation 
midlands electric distribution business accounted for approximately of its net income before interest and income taxes for the fiscal year ended march all the recs  including midlands  are in the process of a distribution price review 
this process occurs every five years and is scheduled to take effect april  the public must be notified six months prior to any price changes  therefore  prices must be set and announced by october  see note of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for an additional discussion of cinergy s investment in midlands 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p other matters midwest iso during  the ferc approved the formation of a midwest independent system operator midwest iso 
the midwest iso is the result of cinergy s collaboration with other midwestern utility companies to form an independent system operator iso that will assume functional control of their combined transmission systems and facilitate a reliable  efficient market for electric power 
the iso will provide non discriminatory open transmission access consistent with ferc order no 
the iso will also be responsible for system reliability and administration of a regional transmission tariff  which will eliminate pancaking of transmission rates in the region 
the midwest iso will be governed by a recently elected  disinterested board of directors 
in addition to the iso concept  other utilities have proposed to transfer their transmission assets to a for profit independent regional transmission company transco 
although cinergy is not opposed to the formation of transcos in the long run  it believes that an iso is a more efficient and effective interim measure to immediately address market power issues and improve system reliability 
currently  there are utility members participating in the midwest iso 
the midwest iso consists of  miles of transmission lines and covers portions of states  and includes over billion of transmission investment  forming one of the largest isos in the country 
the midwest iso plans on beginning operations in the year repeal of the puhca puhca limits registered public utility holding companies such as cinergy from competing for growth opportunities both domestically and internationally 
under puhca  registered public utility holding companies are limited in the amount of foreign investments and in domestic investments in generation they can make 
it also restricts business combinations through its requirement that the electric systems of combining entities be integrated 
past efforts to repeal puhca have not been successful 
in february  a bill to repeal significant parts of puhca s 
 was introduced in the us senate 
recently  the bill was voted out of the senate banking committee without markup  and now goes to the full senate 
while it is uncertain whether this bill will be enacted into law  cinergy continues to support the repeal of this act either as part of comprehensive reform of the electric industry or as separate legislation 
substantial accounting implications historically  regulated utilities have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation statement 
the accounting afforded regulated utilities in statement is based on the fundamental premise that rates authorized by regulators allow recovery of a utility s costs 
these principles have allowed the deferral of costs ie  regulatory assets based on assurances of a regulator as to the future recoverability of the costs in rates charged to customers 
certain criteria must be met for the continued application of the provisions of statement  including regulated rates designed to recover the specific utility s costs 
failure to satisfy the criteria in statement would eliminate the basis for recognition of regulatory assets 
based on cinergy s current regulatory orders and the regulatory environment in which it currently operates  the recognition of its regulatory assets as of december   is fully supported 
however  in light of recent trends in customer choice legislation  the potential for future losses resulting from discontinuance of statement does exist 
such potential losses  if any  cannot be determined until such time as a legislated plan has been approved by each state in which cinergy operates a franchise territory 
cinergy intends to continue its pursuit of competitive strategies which mitigate the potential impact of these issues on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
gas utility industry cinergy and cg e customer choice choice of gas supplier or pilot customer choice programs are operating in several states 
cg e currently participates in a gas customer choice program in ohio 
this program  which made customer choice available to all residential and small commercial customers in november  was extended during gas customers in approximately two thirds of the state of ohio are now eligible to participate in this voluntary program 
large industrial  commercial  and educational institution customers already had the ability to select their own gas supplier 
cinergy resources  inc cri  cinergy s gas retail marketing subsidiary  is one of many entities competing for customer gas supply business in these programs 
cg e continues to provide gas transportation services for substantially all customers within its franchise territory without regard to the supplier of the gas commodity 
cg e receives a transportation charge from customers  which is based on its current regulated rates 
cinergy acquisition of proenergy in june  cinergy  through cinergy capital trading  inc cc t  acquired producers energy marketing  llc proenergy from apache corporation apache and oryx energy company oryx 
proenergy has exclusive marketing rights to north american gas production owned or controlled by apache and oryx  which represents approximately billion cubic feet per day of dedicated natural gas supply 
these supplies  combined with the active marketing of third party gas  are geographically diverse and are spread through the southwest  rocky mountains  gulf coast  gulf of mexico  and michigan 
the acquisition was funded with cash and the issuance of  new shares of cinergy common stock

rate orders and other regulatory matters cinergy and psi indiana indiana utility regulatory commission iurc orders psi s retail rate order and demand side management dsm order in september  the iurc issued an order september order approving an overall average retail rate increase for psi of million annually 
the order reflects a return on common equity of and an overall rate of return on net original rate base of 
in settlement of a challenge by consumer groups to the september order  the iurc approved a settlement agreement which reduced the original rate increase by million in august in a separate order issued by the iurc in december december dsm order  psi was granted permission to recover million per year for the four years ending december   through a non bypassable charge in psi s retail rates for previously incurred dsm costs and associated carrying costs 
further  psi is authorized to spend up to million annually on ongoing dsm programs through the year and to collect such amounts currently in retail rates 
coal contract buyout costs in august  psi entered into a coal supply agreement with eagle coal company eagle for the supply of approximately three million tons of coal per year 
the agreement  which expires december   provides for a buyout fee of million including interest to be included in the price of coal to psi over the term of the contract 
this fee represents the costs to eagle of the buyout of a previous coal supply agreement between psi and exxon coal and minerals company 
the buyout charge  excluding the portion applicable to joint owners  is being recovered through the wholesale and retail fuel adjustment clauses  with carrying costs on unrecovered amounts  through december see note f of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
coal gasification contract buyout costs in november  psi and destec energy inc destec entered into a year contractual agreement for the provision of coal gasification services at psi s wabash river generating station 
the agreement requires psi to pay destec a base monthly fee including certain monthly operating expenses 
psi received authorization in the september order for the inclusion of these costs in retail rates 
in addition  psi received authorization to defer  for subsequent recovery in retail rates  the base monthly fees and expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the september order 
over the next five years  the base monthly fees and expenses for the coal gasification service agreement are expected to total million 
in september  psi reached agreement with dynegy inc dynegy inc 
purchased destec in june to purchase the remainder of its year contract for coal gasification services for approximately million 
the proposed purchase  which is contingent upon regulatory approval satisfactory to psi  could be completed in psi is investigating its financing alternatives 
the transaction  if approved as proposed  is not expected to have a material impact on psi s earnings 
currently  natural gas prices have fallen to a level which causes the synthetic gas supply taken under the current gasification services agreement to be substantially above market 
if the buyout of the gasification services agreement is approved  the combustion turbine will be fired with natural gas  or with synthetic gas if it can be produced at a cost competitive with natural gas 
in nominal dollars  it is estimated that the total savings  primarily as a result of the purchase  would be approximately million over the life of the contract 
cinergy and cg e ohio public utilities commission of ohio puco order cg e s gas rate order in december  the puco issued an order december order approving an overall average increase in gas revenues for cg e of million annually 
the puco established an overall rate of return of  including a return on common equity of 
the puco disallowed certain of cg e s requests  including the requested working capital allowance  recovery of certain capitalized information systems development costs  and certain merger related costs 
these disallowances resulted in a pretax charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of of million million net of taxes or 
per share basic  
per share diluted 
cg e s request for a rehearing on the disallowed information systems costs and other aspects of the order was denied 
in april  cg e filed a notice of appeal with the supreme court of ohio challenging the disallowance of information systems costs and the imputation of certain revenues 
cinergy and cg e cannot predict what action the supreme court of ohio may take with respect to this appeal 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p kentucky in exchange for the kentucky public service commission s kpsc support of the merger  in may  ulh p accepted the kpsc s request for an electric rate moratorium commencing after ulh p s next retail rate case which has not yet been filed and extending to january  in addition  the kpsc has authorized concurrent recovery of costs related to various dsm programs of ulh p 
ulh p has deferred its portion of merger costs incurred through december   for future recovery in customer rates 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p sec order authorizing the retention of gas operations in its order approving the merger  the sec reserved judgment over cinergy s ownership of cg e s gas operations for three years  at the end of which period cinergy would be required to address the matter 
in november  the sec issued an order unconditionally approving the retention of cg e s gas businesses 
environmental issues cinergy  cg e  and psi clean air act amendments of caaa the revisions to the clean air act require reductions in both sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxide nox emissions from utility sources 
reductions of these emissions are to be accomplished in two phases 
compliance under phase i was required by january   and phase ii compliance is required by january  to achieve the so reduction objectives of the caaa  emission allowances have been allocated by the us environmental protection agency epa to affected sources eg  cinergy s electric generating units operated by the ecbu 
each allowance permits one ton of so emissions 
the caaa allows compliance to be achieved on a national level  which provides companies the option to achieve this compliance by reducing emissions and or purchasing emission allowances 
all required modifications to cinergy s generating units to implement the phase i compliance plans were completed prior to january  to comply with phase ii so emission requirements  cinergy s current strategy includes a combination of switching to lower sulfur coal blends and utilizing an emission allowance banking strategy to the extent a viable emission allowance market exists 
this cost effective strategy will allow for meeting the phase ii so reduction requirements while maintaining optimal flexibility to meet changes in output due to increased customer choice  as well as potentially significant future environmental requirements 
to meet nox reductions required by phase ii  additional burner modifications are planned on certain affected units in addition to using a system wide nox emission averaging strategy 
capital expenditures are forecast to be less than million to comply with the phase ii nox reductions  substantially all of which are expected to be incurred during these expenditures are included in the amounts provided in the capital requirements section herein 
ozone transport rulemaking in june  the state collaborative known as the ozone transport assessment group made a wide range of recommendations to the epa to address the impact of ozone transport on serious nonattainment areas in the northeast  midwest  and south 
in late  in response to this recommendation  the epa published its proposed call for revisions to state implementation plans sips for statewide reductions in nox emissions 
in october  the epa finalized its ozone transport rule nox sip call 
it applies to states in the eastern half of the us  including the three states in which the cinergy electric utilities operate  and also proposes a model nox trading program 
this rule recommends that states reduce nox emissions from primarily industrial and utility sources to a certain limit by may the epa gave the affected states until september   to incorporate utility nox reductions with a trading program into their sips 
if the states fail to revise their sips accordingly  the epa has proposed to implement a federal plan to accomplish nox reductions by may ohio  indiana  a number of other states  and various industry groups  including some of which cinergy is a member  filed legal challenges to the nox sip call in late ohio and indiana have also provided preliminary indications that they will seek fewer nox reductions from the utility sector in their implementing regulations than the epa has budgeted in its rulemaking 
the state implementing regulations will need the epa s approval 
the current estimate of capital expenditures required for compliance with the epa limits in the new nox sip call is between million and million in dollars between now and this estimate is significantly dependent on several factors  including the final determination regarding both the timing and stringency of the final required nox reductions  the output of cinergy s generating units  the availability of adequate supplies of resources to construct the necessary control equipment  and the extent to which a nox allowance trading market develops  if any 
ambient air standards and regional haze during  the epa revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter and proposed rules for regional haze 
the epa is scheduled to finalize new regional haze rules by the summer of and congress  as part of the funding bill for the surface transportation act  combined the schedules for fine particulates and regional haze implementation 
these new rules increase the pressure for additional nox and so emissions reductions 
depending on the ultimate outcome of the nox sip call  additional nox reductions may be required from states by to address the new eight hour ozone standard 
the epa estimates it will take up to five years to collect sufficient ambient air monitoring data to determine nonattainment areas 
the states will then determine the sources of these particulates and determine a regional emission reduction plan 
the ultimate effect of the new standard could be requirements for newer and cleaner technologies and additional controls on conventional particulates and or reductions in so and nox emissions from utility sources 
at this time  the exact amount and timing of required reductions cannot be predicted 
global climate change in december  delegates to the united nations climate summit in japan adopted a landmark environmental treaty kyoto protocol to deal with global warming 
the kyoto protocol establishes legally binding greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations 
on november   the us signed the kyoto protocol 
however  for the kyoto protocol to enter into force within the us it will have to be ratified by a two thirds vote of the us senate 
the kyoto protocol  in its present form  is unlikely to be ratified by the us senate since it does not contain provisions requiring participation of developing countries 
significant uncertainty exists concerning both the science of climate change and the clinton administration s environmental and energy policies and how it intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
cinergy s plan for managing the potential risk and uncertainty of climate change includes implementing cost effective greenhouse gas emission reduction and offsetting activities  encouraging the use of alternative fuels for transportation vehicles a major source of greenhouse gases  funding research of more efficient and alternative electric generating technologies  funding research to better understand the causes and consequences of climate change  and encouraging a global discussion of the issues and how best to manage them 
the ecbu believes that voluntary programs  such as the us department of energy doe climate challenge program  which cinergy joined in  are the most cost effective means to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
air toxics the air toxics provisions of the caaa exempted fossil fueled steam utility plants from mandatory reduction of air toxics until the epa completed a study 
the final report  issued in february  confirmed utility air toxic emissions pose little risk to public health 
it stated mercury is the pollutant with the greatest potential threat  while others require further study 
a mercury study report  issued in december  stated that mercury is not a risk to the average american and expressed uncertainty whether reductions in current domestic sources would reduce human mercury exposure 
us utilities are a large domestic source  but they are negligible compared to global mercury emissions 
the epa was unable to show a feasible mercury control technology for coal fired utilities 
in november  the epa finalized its mercury information collection request icr 
pursuant to the icr  all generating units must provide detailed information about coal use and mercury content 
the epa will also select about generating units for one time stack sampling 
at that time  the epa also announced that it would make its regulatory determination on the need for additional regulation by the fourth quarter of it will utilize the new information from the icr  a new study by the national academy of sciences  and other additional information 
if more air toxics regulations are issued  the compliance cost could be significant 
the outcome or effects of the epa s determination cannot currently be predicted 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p other as more fully discussed in note b ii of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data  psi has received claims from indiana gas company  inc igc and northern indiana public service company nipsco that psi is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites  and therefore is responsible for the costs of investigating and remediating these sites 
in november  nipsco  igc  and psi entered into an agreement which settled the allocation of cercla liability for past and future costs among the three companies  at seven mgp sites in indiana 
similar agreements were reached between igc and psi which allocate cercla liability at mgp sites with which nipsco had no involvement 
these agreements conclude all cercla and similar claims between the three companies relative to mgp sites 
pursuant to the agreements  the parties are continuing to investigate and remediate the sites as appropriate 
in the case of some sites  the parties have applied to the indiana department of environmental management for inclusion of such sites in the indiana voluntary remediation program 
reserves recorded  based on information currently available  are not material to cinergy s financial condition or results of operations 
however  as further investigation and remediation activities are undertaken at these sites  the potential liability for mgp sites could be material to cinergy s financial condition or results of operations 
refer to notes b and c of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for a more detailed discussion of the status of certain environmental issues 
capital requirements construction and other investing activities cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the regulated businesses of cinergy cg e  ulh p  and psi forecast construction expenditures for and over the next five years to be approximately million and million for cg e including million and million for ulh p and million and million for psi  respectively 
the timing and amount of investments by cinergy s non regulated businesses is dependent upon the development and favorable evaluation of opportunities 
the above forecast excludes the estimated expenditures necessary to comply with the epa s proposed stricter nox emission control standards associated with the state nox sip call 
cinergy estimates that the capital costs for additional nox controls at its facilities could range between million and million in dollars over the next five years 
the above forecast also excludes any capital expenditures that may be required for the construction of new generating facilities 
in order to meet the power supply demands of its customers  the ecbu must constantly assess the adequacy of its supply portfolio and determine which supply alternatives to pursue to most effectively meet demands  hedge risks  and satisfy regulatory requirements 
supply alternatives include investments in existing facilities  investments in new facilities  and or acquisitions of power supply from the market 
in addition  cinergy s present demand requirements could be impacted if customer choice legislation is passed in any of the states in which cinergy has a regulated franchise 
all forecasted amounts  excluding nox compliance amounts  are in nominal dollars and reflect assumptions as to the economy  capital markets  construction programs  legislative and regulatory actions  frequency and timing of rate increases  and other related factors  all or any of which may change significantly 
cinergy cinergy s mission is to reach the top five in our industry within three years on five key dimensions market capitalization  number of customers  electric and gas commodity trading  international presence  and productivity 
cinergy has entered into various growth initiatives in its pursuit of these goals 
these initiatives include  among others  energy marketing and trading  retail energy products and services  and additional international investment 
in addition  cinergy is working toward maximizing the value of its existing operations and assets and continues to explore the potential for mergers  acquisitions  and strategic alliances 
certain legal and regulatory requirements  including puhca  limit cinergy s ability to invest in growth initiatives 
puhca restricts the amount which can be invested outside the regulated utility  including foreign utility company fuco investments and investments in domestic power plants that qualify as qualifying facilities qfs under the public utility regulatory policies act of or are certified as ewgs by the ferc 
under these restrictions  cinergy may invest or commit to invest i an amount equal to of consolidated retained earnings defined under applicable sec regulations as the average of cinergy s consolidated retained earnings for the four most recent quarterly periods in ewgs and fucos equal to million at december   and ii an amount equal to of consolidated capitalization million at december  in qfs and other energy related nonutility investments as defined in the applicable sec regulation 
at december   under these sec restrictions  cinergy had available capacity for additional ewg fuco investments of million and available capacity for additional qfs and energy related nonutility investments of million 
other commitments cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p securities redemptions mandatory redemptions of long term debt total million million for cg e and its subsidiaries  including million for ulh p  and million for psi during the period through the maintenance and replacement fund provisions contained in psi s first mortgage bond indenture require cash payments  bond retirements  or pledges of unfunded property additions each year based on an amount related to psi s net revenues 
cinergy will continue to evaluate opportunities for the refinancing of outstanding securities beyond mandatory redemption requirements 
cinergy guarantees at december   cinergy had issued million in guarantees primarily related to the energy marketing and trading activities of its subsidiaries and affiliates 
in addition  cinergy had guaranteed million of the debt securities of its subsidiaries and affiliates 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p year the year issue generally exists because many computer systems and applications  including those embedded in equipment and facilities  use two digit rather than four digit date fields to designate an applicable year 
as a result  the systems and applications may not properly recognize dates including and beyond the year or accurately process data in which such dates are included  potentially causing data miscalculations and inaccuracies or operational malfunctions and failures  which could materially affect a business s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
cinergy has established a centrally managed  company wide initiative  known as the cinergy year readiness program  to identify  evaluate  and address year issues 
the cinergy year readiness program  which began in the fourth quarter of  is generally focused on three elements that are integral to this initiative business continuity  risk management  and regulatory compliance 
business continuity includes providing reliable electric and gas supply and service in a safe and cost effective manner 
this element encompasses mission critical generation  transmission  and distribution systems and related infrastructure  as well as operational and financial information technology it systems and applications  end user computing resources  and building systems such as security  elevator  and heating and cooling systems 
risk management includes a review of the year readiness efforts of cinergy s critical suppliers  key customers and other principal business partners  and  as appropriate  the development of joint business support  contingency plans  and the inclusion of year concerns as a regular part of the due diligence process in any new business venture 
regulatory compliance includes communications with regulatory agencies  other utilities  and various industry groups 
while this initiative is broad in scope  it has been structured to identify and prioritize efforts for mission critical electric and gas systems and services and key business partners 
under the cinergy year readiness program  cinergy has established a target date of june   for the remediation and testing of its mission critical generation  transmission  and distribution systems gas and electric 
an innovative remediation and testing effort which cinergy has initiated involves operating several electric generating units with post year dates 
cinergy s experience has been that those units have continued to operate without any material adverse result relating to a year issue 
cinergy s progress to date ranges from approximately regarding it systems to approximately regarding assessment of critical suppliers 
cinergy has also reviewed its existing contingency and business continuity plans and modified them in light of the year issue 
contingency planning to maintain and restore service in the event of natural and other disasters including software and hardware related problems has been part of cinergy s standard operation for many years  and cinergy is working to leverage this experience in the review of existing plans to address year related challenges 
these reviews have assessed the potential for business disruption in various scenarios  including the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and to provide for key operational back up  recovery  and restoration alternatives 
cinergy cannot guarantee that third parties on whom it depends for essential goods and services those where the interruption of the supply of such goods and services could lead to issues involving the safety of employees  customers  or the public  the continued reliable delivery of gas and or electricity  and the ability to comply with applicable laws or regulations will convert their mission critical systems and processes in a timely manner 
failure or delay by any of these third parties could significantly disrupt business 
however  to address this issue  cinergy has established a supplier compliance program  and is working with its critical suppliers in an effort to minimize such risks 
in addition  cinergy is coordinating its findings and other issues with other utilities and various industry groups via the electric power research institute year embedded systems project and the year readiness assessment program of the north american electric reliability council nerc  acting at the request of the doe 
the doe has asked nerc to report on the integrity of the transmission system for north america and to coordinate and assess the preparation of the electric systems in north america for the year nerc submitted its initial quarterly status report and coordination plan to the doe in september  and a second quarterly status report for the fourth quarter of was submitted on january  cinergy currently estimates that the total cost of assessment  remediation  testing  and upgrading its systems as a result of the year effort is approximately million 
approximately million in expenses have been incurred through december   for external labor  hardware and software upgrades  and for cinergy employees who are dedicated full time to the cinergy year readiness program 
the timing of these expenses may vary and is not necessarily indicative of readiness efforts or progress to date 
cinergy anticipates that a portion of its year expenses will not be incremental costs  but rather  will represent the redeployment of existing it resources 
since its formation  cinergy has incurred  and will continue to incur  significant capital improvement costs related to planned system upgrades or replacements required in the normal course of business 
these costs have not been accelerated as a result of the year issue 
the above information is based on cinergy s current best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including the availability and future costs of certain technological and other resources  third party modification actions  and other factors 
given the complexity of these issues and possible unidentified risks  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and discussed above 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  among others  the ability to locate and correct all affected computer code  the timing and success of remedial efforts of third party suppliers  and similar uncertainties 
the above information is a year readiness disclosure pursuant to the federal year information and readiness disclosure act 
capital resources cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the regulated businesses of cinergy forecast that their need for external funds during the through period will primarily be for the refinancing of existing securities 
it is currently expected that funds required to pursue the various non regulated growth initiatives underway will be obtained primarily through short term borrowing and the issuance of long term debt and or equity securities 
this forecast reflects nominal dollars and assumptions as to the economy  capital markets  construction programs  legislative and regulatory actions  frequency and timing of rate increases  and other related factors  all or any of which may change significantly 
internal funds cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p currently  a substantial portion of cinergy s revenues and corresponding cash flows are derived from cost of service regulated operations 
cinergy believes it is likely that the generation component of the electric utility industry will ultimately be deregulated 
however  the timing and nature of the deregulation and restructuring of the industry is uncertain 
in the interim  revenues provided by cost of service regulated operations are anticipated to continue as the primary source of funds for cinergy 
as a result of its low cost position and market strategy  over the long term  cinergy believes it will be successful in a more competitive environment 
however  as the industry becomes more competitive  future cash flows from operations could be subject to a higher degree of volatility than under the present regulatory structure 
common stock cinergy during   and  cinergy issued approximately   and  new shares  respectively  of common stock pursuant to various stock based employee plans 
in addition  cinergy purchased approximately  and million shares on the open market to satisfy the majority of its and obligations  respectively  under these plans 
cinergy currently plans to continue using market purchases of common stock to satisfy the majority of its obligations under these plans  however  given its future capital requirements  it will continue to re evaluate this decision 
in the event cinergy begins issuing shares of common stock to satisfy these obligations  it has authority under puhca to issue and sell through december   up to approximately million additional shares of cinergy common stock 
short term debt cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p cinergy has authority under puhca to issue and sell  through december   short term notes  long term unsecured debentures  and commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed billion 
the entire amount may be outstanding as short term debt  however  long term unsecured debentures outstanding may not exceed million at any time 
in connection with this authority  cinergy has established committed and uncommitted lines of credit  of which million remained unused and available at december  also at year end  global resources had million available under its revolving credit facility 
as of december   cinergy s utility subsidiaries had regulatory authority to borrow up to million for cg e and its subsidiaries  including million for ulh p  and million for psi 
pursuant to this authority  committed and uncommitted lines of credit have been established for cg e and psi of which  million and million  respectively  remained unused and available at december  for a detailed discussion of the registrants short term indebtedness  refer to note of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
long term debt cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p under the authority mentioned above  cinergy had long term debt authorization of million  of which million was issued and outstanding at december  cg e has filed an application with the puco requesting authorization to issue up to million of additional long term debt 
as of december   psi and ulh p had state regulatory authority for additional long term debt issuance of million and million  respectively 
regulatory approval to issue additional amounts of securities will be requested as needed

market risk sensitive instruments and positions energy commodities sensitivity cinergy  cg e  and psi the transactions associated with the energy marketing and trading activities give rise to various risks  including market risk 
market risk represents the potential risk of loss from changes in the market value of a particular commitment arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
these operations subject cinergy to the risks and volatilities associated with the energy commodities primarily electricity and natural gas which it markets and trades 
the wholesale energy marketing and trading business continues to be very competitive 
as the ecbu continues to develop and expand its energy marketing and trading business  its exposure to movements in the price of electricity and other energy commodities will become greater 
as a result  cinergy is likely to be subject to future earnings volatility 
the energy marketing and trading activities of the ecbu principally consist of cg e s and psi s power marketing and trading operation which markets and trades over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity primarily in the midwest region of the us  where owned generation is located 
these activities are conducted by services on behalf of cg e and psi 
the power marketing and trading operation consists of both physical and trading activities 
transactions are designated as physical when there is intent and ability to physically deliver the power from company owned generation 
all other transactions are considered trading transactions 
substantially all of the contracts in both the physical and trading portfolios commit cinergy  cg e  and or psi to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future ie  fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts  full requirements contracts 
the ecbu also markets and trades over the counter option contracts 
substantially all of the contracts in the physical portfolio require settlement by physical delivery of electricity 
contracts within the trading portfolio generally require settlement by physical delivery or are netted out in accordance with industry trading standards 
the use of these types of physical commodity instruments is designed to allow the ecbu to manage and hedge contractual commitments  reduce exposure relative to the volatility of cash market prices  and take advantage of selected arbitrage opportunities 
the ecbu structures and modifies its net position to capture expected changes in future demand  seasonal market pricing characteristics  overall market sentiment  and price relationships between different time periods and trading regions 
therefore  at times  a net open position is created or allowed to continue when it is believed future changes in prices and market conditions will make the positions profitable 
position imbalances may also occur because of the basic lack of liquidity in the wholesale power market 
to the extent net open positions exist  there is the risk that fluctuating market prices of electric power may potentially impact cinergy s  cg e s  and or psi s financial condition or results of operations adversely if prices do not move in the manner or direction expected 
the ecbu measures the risk inherent in the trading portfolio utilizing value at risk analysis and other methodologies  which utilize forward price curves in electric power markets to quantify estimates of the magnitude and probability of potential future losses related to open contract positions 
predominantly all of the contracts in the physical portfolio require physical delivery of electricity and generally do not allow for net cash settlement 
therefore  these contracts are not included in the value at risk analysis 
the value at risk expresses the potential loss in fair value of the trading portfolio over a particular period of time  with a specified likelihood of occurrence  due to an adverse market movement 
the value at risk is reported as a percentage of operating income  based on a confidence interval  utilizing one day holding periods 
on a one day basis as of december   the value at risk for the power trading activities was less than of cinergy s consolidated operating income 
the average value at risk  on a one day basis at the end of each quarter in  for the power trading portfolio was less than of cinergy s consolidated operating income 
the daily value at risk for the power trading portfolio as of december   was also less than of cinergy s consolidated operating income 
the value at risk model uses the variance covariance statistical modeling technique and historical volatilities and correlations over the past day period 
the estimated market prices used to value these transactions for value at risk purposes reflect the use of established pricing models and various factors including quotations from exchanges and over the counter markets  price volatility factors  the time value of money  and location differentials 
cinergy the ecbu  through cinergy s acquisitions of proenergy and greenwich energy partners  in and  respectively  actively markets physical natural gas and actively trades derivative commodity instruments  customarily settled in cash  including futures  forwards  swaps  and options 
the esbu  through cri  utilizes derivative commodity instruments  customarily settled in cash  primarily to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas 
the aggregated value at risk amounts associated with these trading and hedging activities  utilizing confidence intervals and one day holding periods  were less than million as of december  and the market risk exposures of these trading activities is not considered significant to cinergy s financial condition or results of operations 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p credit risk represents the risk of loss which would occur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations with the company 
concentrations of credit risk relate to significant customers or counterparties  or groups of customers or counterparties  possessing similar economic or industry characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
concentration of credit risk with respect to the esbu s trade accounts receivable from electric and gas retail customers is limited due to the large number of customers and diversified customer base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers 
contracts within the physical portfolio of the ecbu s power marketing and trading operations are primarily with traditional electric cooperatives and municipalities and other ious 
contracts within the trading portfolio of the power marketing and trading operations are primarily with power marketers and other ious 
as of december   approximately of the activity within the trading portfolio represents commitments with counterparties 
the majority of these contracts are for terms of one year or less 
as a result of the extreme volatility experienced in the midwest power markets during  several new entrants into the market began experiencing financial difficulties and failed to perform their contractual obligations 
as a result  the bad debt provisions of approximately million with respect to settled transactions were recorded during the year 
counterparty credit exposure within the power trading portfolio is routinely factored into the mark to market valuation 
at december   credit exposure within the power trading portfolio is not believed to be significant 
prior to  credit exposure due to nonperformance by counterparties was not significant 
as the competitive electric power market continues to develop  counterparties will increasingly include new market entrants  such as other power marketers  brokers  and commodity traders 
this increased level of new market entrants  as well as competitive pressures on existing market participants  could increase the ecbu s exposure to credit risk with respect to its power marketing and trading operation 
as of december   approximately of the activity within the ecbu s physical gas marketing and trading portfolio represents commitments with counterparties 
credit risk losses related to the ecbu s gas and other commodity physical and trading operations have not been significant 
based on the types of counterparties and customers with which transactions are executed  credit exposure within the gas and other commodity trading portfolios at december   is not believed to be significant 
cinergy  cg e  and psi cinergy has established a risk management function and has implemented active risk management policies and procedures to manage and minimize corporate and business unit exposure to price risks and associated volatilities  other market risks  and credit risk 
cinergy maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties in order to manage and minimize its exposure to credit risk 
these policies include requiring parent company guarantees and various forms of collateral under certain circumstances and the use of mutual netting closeout agreements 
cinergy manages  on a portfolio basis  the market risks inherent in its energy marketing and trading transactions subject to parameters established by cinergy s risk policy committee 
market and credit risks are monitored by the risk management and credit function  which operates separately from the business units which originate or actively manage the market and credit risk exposures  to ensure compliance with cinergy s stated risk management policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and monitored to ensure their responsiveness to changing market and business conditions 
in addition  efforts are ongoing to develop systems to improve the timeliness and quality of market and credit risk information 
exchange rate sensitivity cinergy cinergy has exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar uk pound sterling exchange rate through its investment in midlands 
cinergy used dollar denominated variable interest rate debt to fund this investment  and has hedged the exchange rate exposure related to this transaction through a currency swap 
under the swap  cinergy exchanged million for million pounds sterling 
when the swap terminates in the year  these amounts will be re exchanged  that is  cinergy will be repaid million and will be obligated to repay to the counterparty million pounds sterling 
to fund this repayment  cinergy could buy million pounds sterling in the foreign exchange market at the prevailing spot rate or enter into a new currency swap 
the purpose of this swap is to hedge the value of cinergy s investment in midlands against changes in the dollar pound sterling exchange rate 
when the pound sterling weakens relative to the dollar  the dollar value of cinergy s investment in midlands as shown on its books declines  however  the value of the swap increases  offsetting the decline in the investment 
the reverse is true when the pound sterling appreciates relative to the dollar 
the translation gains and losses related to the principal exchange on the swap and on cinergy s original investment in midlands are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is reported as a separate component of common stock equity in the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with this swap  cinergy must pay semi annual interest on its pound sterling obligation and will receive semi annual interest on the dollar notional amount 
at december   the estimated fair value of this swap was million 
this was partially offset by a million currency translation gain to date on cinergy s investment in midlands 
cinergy also has exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar czech koruna exchange rate through its investments in the czech republic 
cinergy has hedged the exchange rate exposure related to certain of its czech koruna czk denominated investments through foreign exchange forward contracts 
the contracts require cinergy to exchange  million czech korunas for million 
when the czech koruna strengthens relative to the dollar  the dollar value of cinergy s investment increases  however  the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts decreases  offsetting the increase in the investment 
the reverse is true when the czech koruna declines relative to the dollar 
translation losses related to the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is reported as a separate component of common stock equity in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the estimated aggregate fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts was million 
cinergy has investments in various other countries where the net investments are not hedged 
the company does have exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of these countries 
at december   cinergy does not believe it has a material exposure to the currency risk attributable to these investments 
the following table summarizes the details of the swap and the foreign exchange forward contracts

under these swaps  cinergy or its subsidiaries agree with counterparties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated on an agreed notional amount 
this interest differential paid or received is recognized in the consolidated statements of income as a component of interest expense 
through one interest rate swap agreement  cinergy has effectively fixed the interest rate on the pound sterling denominated obligation created by the currency swap discussed above 
this contract requires cinergy to pay semi annually a fixed rate and receive a floating rate through february the notional amount of the swap is million pounds sterling 
the fair value of the swap was approximately million at december  translation gains and losses related to cinergy s interest obligation  which is payable in pounds sterling  are recognized as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   the fair value of this swap decreased from million at december  primarily due to a projected decline in the average variable interest rate received on the dollar denominated leg of the swap over its remaining term

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement 
statement requires companies to record derivative instruments  as defined in statement  as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting
