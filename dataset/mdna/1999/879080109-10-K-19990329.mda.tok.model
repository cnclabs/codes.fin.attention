these forward looking statements are subject to factors beyond the control of registrant such as weather and market and economic forces and  with respect to the registrant s future development of its land  the availability of financing and the ability to obtain various governmental entitlements 
no assurance can be given that actual future events will be consistent with the forward looking statements made in this annual report 
overview in january  registrant implemented a new strategic plan that sets out a broad strategy for enhancing shareholder value 
specifically  the plan focuses on development and making more productive use of registrant s largest and most valuable asset  its  acre land holding  and increasing revenue and net income in the three core businesses of real estate  livestock  and farming 
registrant intends to focus on increasing revenues and net income by continuing to develop its significant land holding and by expanding its core business lines 
currently  registrant is working to take advantage of existing resources and market conditions as well as to anticipate and create future market trends and demand 
part of this effort includes evaluating registrant s land and water resources to ensure that the resources essential for growing the core businesses are available when and where needed 
in the future  registrant will continue to assess the feasibility of entering into complementary new related lines of business and refining or reconfiguring current core businesses to take advantage of opportunities presented and changing market conditions 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  net income was  in   in  and  in net income for increased when compared to due primarily to increased sales within the livestock division and the real estate division 
net income for increased when compared to due to higher operating profits within the livestock division  and increased easement sales within the real estate division 
changes in revenues and expenses of registrant s industry segments for years and are summarized below 
real estate 
real estate net operating income of  in is  greater than net operating income 
this increase in net operating income during was due primarily to the sale of  acres of previously leased land to northrop grumman  which resulted in a gain of   net of tax 
in addition to the sale of land  real estate revenues increased approximately  due to increased lease revenues and the sale of land for a pump station to pacific pipeline 
these increases in revenue are partially offset by higher fixed water costs and the recording in of a one time payment of  related to the acquisition of easement rights by a pipeline company 
fixed water costs increased due to the cost of additional water entitlement and water banking charges 
in future years the real estate division could continue to see an increase in costs primarily related to professional service fees and staffing costs as registrant continues to increase its real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
registrant will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for its land holdings 
future sales of land  as in  are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
registrant s goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial  industrial  and residential programs 
see part i  item  business commercial and land use for a further discussion of and activity and future planning activities 
real estate operating profits of  in is a  increase when compared to s operating loss 
the increase during is due primarily to the receipt of a one time payment of   net of tax in revenue from a pipeline company for the acquisition of easement rights 
this increase is partially offset by higher professional service and planning fees  and higher staffing costs 
professional service fees increased due to market evaluations being conducted to determine the feasibility of developing a destination land use at grapevine center and a rural ranch estates program 
staffing costs increased due to the hiring of a new vice president of real estate 
livestock 
livestock net operating profits of  in is  less than net operating income 
the decrease when compared to is primarily attributable to reduced cattle prices throughout that reduced the net margins on cattle sold 
net margins at champion feeders  registrant s feedlot  were also reduced due to increased feed inventory costs 
cattle sales revenue increased approximately  during due to  additional head of cattle being sold 
on a comparable basis with sales  the increase in cattle sales revenues was less than it should have been due to lower cattle prices throughout and the moving of sales scheduled for november and december to february to take advantage of improving market conditions 
revenues at the feedlot increased approximately  in when compared to due to owning champion feeders for the entire year of  increased average occupancy in the feedlot during july and august  and the sale of cattle as to which the feedlot was in partnership with customers of the feedlot 
champion feeders was purchased march  these increases in revenues were more than offset by an increase in the cost of sales on cattle sold and to increased feedlot expenses 
cost of sales of cattle increased primarily due to the increase in the number of cattle sold and to a slight increase in costs due to owning the cattle for longer periods of time 
feedlot expenses increased approximately  when compared to due to the timing of the purchase of the feedlot during  increased feed inventory costs and to cost of sales related to cattle sold as described above 
registrant  with the purchase of the feedlot in  changed its operating procedures and now continues to own cattle through the feedlot phase in order to have more direct control over the quality of beef the cattle are producing 
by holding the cattle for a longer period of time  the weights on the cattle will increase and registrant will receive more for the animals but the cost of sales will also increase due to the cost of feeding for the additional period of ownership 
registrant continued to use the futures and options markets to protect the future selling price of cattle and purchase prices of feed throughout without the ability to manage cattle and feed positions during  registrant s net operating income from livestock would have been  less 
during  due to the increase in cattle prices throughout most of that year  registrant recognized approximately  in losses on hedge positions 
many of the gains from these activities in were due to the decline of cattle prices during  especially during the first half of the year 
registrant s goal in managing its cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allows registrant to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in managing cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap potential gains from the increase in price and the risk in managing feed costs is that it can add additional costs for feed if grain prices fall dramatically 
cattle prices during were depressed due to the supply of cattle held in feedlots and to lower export sales 
with beef being the largest dollar agricultural export and asia receiving much of the beef exported  prices fell significantly beginning in december and throughout the first five months of not only did prices decline in the beef market  but prices for hides  which are used in the production of leather  also declined 
hide prices declined almost over this time period 
continued periods of declining cattle placement in united states feedlots may result in tightening supplies relative to demand  even with the reduced demand from asia and other parts of the world 
the effect of this could be improving prices during  but the prices may still be lower than might normally be the case due to continued pressure on exports 
on march   registrant purchased the assets of champion feeders  a feedlot that is located in western texas 
registrant will operate this feedlot for its use as well as that of other customers who want to feed cattle 
the feedlot was purchased for million  has a cattle head capacity of  and covers approximately acres 
registrant believes that by controlling the feeding phase of its cattle before sending them to packing houses  a better quality product will be produced providing higher margins to registrant 
in connection with the purchase of the feedlot registrant began a program in to expand the cattle herd 
at december   registrant had  head of cattle  which is approximately  head more than in this will allow registrant to provide additional cattle for the feedlot operation and potentially increase the earnings from its cattle operations 
registrant also became involved in a strategic alliance during with other select producers and a packer to produce a high grade beef product to be sold to steak restaurants and higher end grocery stores 
the strategic alliance was formed in order for the producers of cattle to gain higher margins on the beef they produce and sell 
livestock net operating income of  in was an increase of  when compared to net operating income 
the growth in net operating income was due primarily to an increase in cattle sales revenue  and net operating income provided by the cattle feedlot that was purchased early in 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in cost of sales on cattle sold of approximately  cattle sales revenue grew during due to an increase in volume of cattle sold  and higher prices on the cattle sold 
during  additional head of cattle were sold and the weights at which the cattle were sold averaged approximately pounds per head greater than in cost of sales increased due to owning the cattle for longer periods of time during than in past years 
see part i  item business livestock operations for a further discussion of registrant s livestock operations for and future expectations 
farming 
net operating income within the farming division was  a decrease of  when compared to net operating income 
the decrease in net operating income is due to lower grape revenues  and pistachio revenues  and higher fixed water costs 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher almond revenues  an increase in farming lease payments  and lower cultural costs 
registrant s almond production increased despite poor weather during the spring  due primarily to the increase in production from newer almond plantings 
revenues from almonds also reflect higher estimated prices than the prior year due to the lower statewide crop and a minimal inventory carryover from the prior year 
the combination of increased production and higher estimated prices led to almond revenues increasing approximately in grape yields in declined when compared to  which caused grape revenues to decline when compared to pistachio production fell during due to weather related factors during the spring 
due to the reduction in yield  pistachio revenues fell when compared to walnut production increased during but revenues remained flat when compared to due to lower prices on walnuts 
walnut prices declined due to the high inventory levels at the beginning of overall crop production from registrant s farming operation was greater than levels but less than expected due to winter and spring storms during the pollination and bloom period for the crops 
statewide throughout california production on average was down due to weather factors 
this reduction in statewide production kept the prices received on most crops higher than might otherwise be expected 
industry expectations are that statewide nut crop yields should continue to improve  which may negatively impact prices 
in addition  industry projections show a continuation of new almond and pistachio plantings that could impact prices once full production begins 
within the grape industry there continues to be new land developed  which could begin to depress prices in the future once all new developments are in full production 
pricing pressure on grapes did begin during and due to improving production and should continue through all of registrant s crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
for a further discussion of the farming year refer to part i  item business farming operations 
farming operating profits of  in were  less than operating profits 
the decline in operating profits was due to a drop in almond revenues  lower walnut revenues  and higher cultural costs 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased grape revenues  the receipt in of revenues associated with the almond and grape crops  and lower fixed water costs the decrease in almond revenues during was due to a decrease in production of when compared to and a decrease in prices of approximately 
registrant s production fell during due to the timing of rains and cold weather during the critical pollination period 
prices declined due to the california almond industry producing a near record crop 
walnut revenues declined due to a drop in production during the decline in walnut production was due primarily to below normal chilling hours that are required by walnut trees for adequate dormancy during the winter months 
grape revenues increased primarily due to an increase in production of when compared to production increased due to favorable summer weather 
resource management 
resource management operating profits of  in were  or below operating profits 
the decrease in operating profits during is due to lower revenues from oil and gas royalties  increased staffing costs and to increases in the costs related to the annual quarter horse events 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by an increase in revenues from the equestrian program 
oil and gas royalties continue to decline due to lower prices for crude oil and a decline of exploration activities on ranch lands 
the resource management division has been very profitable over the last several years 
however  oil and gas royalties are expected to be adversely affected over the next few years by the fact than little or no new oil and gas exploration is taking place on registrant s lands and oil prices  are expected to stay depressed as they were throughout registrant does expect royalties from cement production to grow over the next year due to increased construction activity and to the cement manufacturing plant being renovated and production capacity being increased but only if economic conditions continue to be favorable for the construction industry 
see part i  item business resource management  for a further discussion of activities and future expectations 
resource management net operating income of  in was  or below net operating income 
the decrease in net operating income during was due to lower revenues from oil and gas royalties  increases in professional service fees and an increase in staffing costs 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased sand rock aggregate royalties  cement royalties  and game management permits 
oil and gas royalties declined due to lower prices for crude oil 
professional service fees and staffing costs increased due to the ongoing monitoring of the activities of oil and gas lessees and monitoring of environmental activities at the national cement lease site 
sand rock and cement royalties increased during due to the growth of construction within southern california and kern county 
game management permit revenues increased due to an expansion of services offered and an increase in hunting programs 
interest 
interest income of  fell  when compared to interest income 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and the continuing growth of registrant that resulted in a  decrease in funds invested 
invested funds declined due to the continued growth of the cattle herd  capital expenditures  payment of dividends and the financing of greater receivables and inventories 
interest income declined to  during from  in due to a  reduction in funds invested 
investment funds declined due to the purchase of the feedlot  capital expenditures  an increase in the cattle herd  payment of dividends and the financing of greater receivables and inventories 
interest expense during was  an increase of  over interest expense in the increase in interest expense is due to the short term funding of the cattle inventory as well as funding the continuing growth in the cattle herd and to infrastructure and construction costs related to development at the tejon industrial complex 
the short term funding of infrastructure costs will be replaced in with longer term debt  but interest costs related to this expense will remain in see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of short term and long term debt 
interest expense for was  an increase of  over the growth in interest expense was due to the addition of long term debt associated with the purchase of the cattle feedlot  outstanding at december  and the short term funding of the growth in the cattle herd 
the feedlot also borrows on a short term basis to provide cattle and feed financing for its outside customers 
the cost of this borrowing approximates the lending bank s prime interest rate 
the feedlot then charges its customers the bank s prime interest rate plus one to one and one half percent for any financing it does 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses during were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase in is due primarily to an increase in staffing costs 
this increase in staffing costs is tied primarily to a change in registrant s short term incentive compensation program 
partially offsetting this increase in staffing costs was a reduction in professional service fees 
corporate expenses for were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase is due to higher professional service charges and staffing costs 
staffing costs increased due to the fact that registrant s new chief executive officer joined registrant in may and served the full year of professional service fees increased due to costs associated with consulting contracts with an investment banking firm 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on registrant s operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to registrant s farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received by registrant for many of its products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for registrant to accurately predict revenue  just as it cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
impact of accounting change 
effective january   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas superseded fasb statement no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
sfas establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of sfas did not affect results of operations or financial position  nor did it affect the disclosure of segment information previously or currently provided by the company 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of january   the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
sfas establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components  however adoption of this statement had no impact on the company s net income 
sfas requires unrealized gains or losses on the company s available for sale securities  foreign currency translation adjustments and defined benefit minimum liability adjustments  to be included in other comprehensive income 
as of january   the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
sfas revises employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
adoption of this statement had no impact on the financial results or financial condition of the company 
effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas standardizes accounting for all derivative contracts and requires that all derivative contracts be reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives meeting certain specific requirements can be designated as hedges and the special accounting of sfas applied 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in the statement of income 
management has elected to not designate its futures and option contracts as hedges 
accordingly  the company reported a  net of tax of  cumulative effect adjustment 
impact of year many older computer hardware  software and imbedded micro controllers are designed to read and store dates using only the last two digits of the year 
as a result they cannot correctly interpret dates beyond the year if not corrected  this problem could cause processing errors or computer system failures that materially adversely affect registrant 
during early registrant initiated a review of all its financial and accounting systems and implemented a conversion plan involving the acquisition of new hardware and software that read and store dates in four digits 
this conversion was completed in at a cost of approximately  of which approximately  was for the purchase of new software and consulting services relating to the conversion 
these expenditures were capitalized and are being depreciated over a three year useful life 
the funds were provided by operations  including use of registrant s short term line of credit 
registrant has conducted limited testing of the new system and believes that it will function effectively when the dates beyond the year are processed 
while registrant believes that its financial and accounting systems are its principal exposure to the year problem  registrant intends to undertake a review of the balance of its operations to determine the extent to which other computer programs and imbedded micro controllers are utilized 
registrant will then undertake to modify or replace any such programs or devices in advance of the end of registrant has communicated with and is communicating with all significant suppliers  customers  financial institutions  utilities  and other third parties upon which it is dependent to determine the extent to which registrant s business operations are vulnerable the failure of those parties to correct their own year problems 
although all responses received to date have been satisfactory  registrant has not completed this phase of its year readiness program 
registrant does not intend to independently test or verify which third parties correct their year problems 
registrant also intends to develop contingency plans to handle its most likely worst case scenarios with respect to the year problem 
registrant intends to complete its determination of worst case scenarios after it has received and analyzed responses to substantially all of the inquiries made of third parties 
the contingency plans are expected to include methods of dealing with third parties that are not dependent upon computer or micro controller technology 
the registrant estimates that it will complete its inquiry of third parties and development of contingency plans well in advance of the end of registrant believes that substantially all of the costs of completing its efforts to be year ready will consist of the compensation expense allocable to employees who work on the project 
registrant does not separately track these costs related to the year project but does not expect them to be material 
all statements in this report regarding the year problem involve forward looking information as to which there is a great uncertainty 
the actual results of the registrant s program to deal with the year problem could differ materially from what registrant plans and anticipates because of the lack of experience of registrant and others with problems of this kind  the extent to which computer and other systems of business and other entities are inter related and the lack of control over  and access to information of third parties upon whom registrant s business is dependent 
the failure of the registrant to correctly analyze and anticipate year problems in its own operations or those of third parties or the failure or inability to develop effective contingency plans could have a material adverse effect on the registrant s business 
financial condition 
registrant s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately  at december   an increase of  from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is approximately  less than working capital at the end of registrant has a revolving line of credit of  that as of december   had a balance of  bearing interest at the rate of  which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
in addition  registrant has an outstanding short term borrowing with an investment banking firm with a balance of  at december  at an interest rate of 
registrant s feedlot also has a short term revolving line of credit for the feedlot with a local bank for  with an outstanding balance at december  of  with an interest rate approximating the bank s prime lending rate of which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
the revolving lines of credit are used as short term cash management tools and for the financing of customer cattle and feed receivables at the feedlot 
the use of short term credit has grown when compared to due to increases in inventories as a result of the growth of registrant s core business lines  and to the funding of infrastructure construction costs on a short term basis 
the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during   and consisted of capital expenditures  expansion of the cattle herd  purchase of the cattle feedlot  purchase of land  payments of long term debt  the payment of dividends and the financing of greater receivables and inventories 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows by registrant is made difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of registrant s products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
registrant  based on its past experience  believes it will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes new equipment and improvements to existing facilities 
registrant is currently expanding its farming operations with the planting of additional almonds completed in early  will continue the expansion of the cattle herd  and is investing approximately  in the infrastructure and off site improvements related to the tejon industrial complex 
these new projects have been and will be funded from current cash resources and registrant s excess borrowing capacity 
registrant has traditionally funded its growth and capital additions from internally generated funds 
management believes that the combination of short term investments  excess borrowing capacity  and capital presently available to it will be sufficient for its near term operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of registrant due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
registrant is exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks registrant is exposed to financial market risks  including changes to interest rate and credit risk related to marketable securities  interest rate related to its own outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of registrant s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields while prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  registrant limits its investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years to limit interest rate exposure and with an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors to minimize credit risk 
in addition  market value changes due to interest rate changes are minimized because a large portion of the portfolio has interest rates that float and are reset on a quarterly basis 
see note  marketable securities  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
registrant is exposed to interest rate exposure on its short term working capital line of credit and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the short term line of credit interest rate is tied to the lending bank s prime rate  and changes when that rate changes 
the long term debt has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of the long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
registrant typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its exposure on this debt through the use of any financial instrument derivatives 
registrant manages its interest rate exposure through negotiation of the terms 
registrant s credit and market risk related to its inventories and receivables ultimately depends on the value of the cattle  almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  registrant believes its credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following table provides information about registrant s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents the company s debt obligations  principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity fair value there after total assets marketable securities       average interest rate liabilities short term debt    average interest rate long term debt        average interest rate in comparison to the prior year registrant s risks in regards to fluctuations in interest rates has increased overall due to the growth in the use of short term lines of credit that fluctuate with the bank s prime lending rate 
the use of short term debt increased approximately million in changes in interest rates in had the same effect under the terms of the debt instruments outstanding as they had in commodity price exposure registrant has exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories  gross margins  accounts receivables  and certain anticipated transactions in its livestock and farming divisions 
commodities such as corn and cattle are purchased and sold at market prices that are subject to volatility 
in order to manage the risk of market price fluctuations  registrant enters into various exchange traded futures and option contracts 
registrant closely monitors and manages its exposure to market price risk on a daily basis in accordance with formal policies established for this activity 
these policies limit the duration to maturity of contracts entered into as well as the level of exposure to be hedged 
registrant s goal in managing its cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allow registrant to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
see note  commodity contracts used to manage risk of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gains on future contracts and options as of december  were  as compared to the approximately  in losses at december  the change is primarily due to a decline in cattle prices during  which caused future contracts and options to be repriced which created gains on the derivative positions 
these gains partially offset the decline in prices received on the sale of cattle 
inventories consist primarily of cattle for sale and price fluctuations are managed with futures and options contracts 
see table below for contracts outstanding at year end 
registrant is at risk with respect to changes in market prices with respect to cattle held for sale that are not protected by futures and options contracts 
at december  approximately of the cattle held in inventory or  head of cattle were not protected by futures and options for price movement 
this compares to  head of cattle at december  the number of head of cattle equates to approximately million pounds of beef 
for each 
per pound change in price  registrant has a potential exposure of  in future value 
although the price which the cattle will ultimately be sold is unknown  over the last three years the market price has ranged from 
per pound to 
per pound and the current market price is 
per pound 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates to almonds and pistachios 
these receivables are recorded at estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is not known until the third or fourth quarter of the following year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december   only  is at risk to changing prices of almonds and  is at risk to changing prices of pistachios 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  and  respectively 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every 
change in the price of almonds registrant s receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years the final prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  each 
change in the price increases or decreases the receivable by  and the range of final prices over the last three years has been
