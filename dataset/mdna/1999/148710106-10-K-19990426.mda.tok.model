year compliance the statements in this section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company is faced with year remediation issues 
many computer programs were written with a two digit date field  which  if not made year compliant  will be unable to correctly process date information on or after january  the company s state of readiness the company established a year committee comprised of senior management of the company and also engaged an independent consulting firm to assist in remediation of the company s year issues 
the company evaluated its internal computer systems and while the data processing systems were found to be impacted to some extent  year issues were found to be most significant in connection with various mainframe computer programs 
in fiscal  the company developed a plan to address year issues as they related to the mainframe computer programs and began the process to convert such computer programs to be year compliant 
during fiscal  the company completed the conversion of its three primary mainframe computer programs to be year compliant 
during fiscal  the company undertook an inventory of its non information technology systems 
such inventory is substantially complete and  where appropriate  the company has made contingency plans in order to minimize any adverse effect year issues may have on such non information technology systems 
during fiscal  the company communicated with and completed a compilation of detailed information regarding its key business partners and major suppliers to determine to what extent the company may be vulnerable to third party year issues 
although the company does not currently anticipate it will experience any material business interruptions or shipment delays from its key business partners and major suppliers due to year issues  at this time  the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of its key business partners and major suppliers to achieve year compliance 
the company is not dependent on a single source for any products or services 
in the event a third party is unable to provide material products or services to the company due to a year computer systems failure  the company believes it has adequate alternate sources for such products or services 
if alternate sources are used  there can be no guarantee that similar or identical products or services would be available on the same terms and conditions or that the company would not experience some adverse effect as a result of switching to such alternate sources 
costs to address the year the company s total year expenditures are estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million are for incremental costs  and are being funded through operating cash flows 
certain other non year computer system projects were deferred in order to ensure completion of the company s year compliance efforts 
although management believes deferring such projects has not had a material adverse effect on the company s operations  it expects these projects  when implemented  will positively impact future results 
the company is expensing all costs associated with year computer system changes as the costs are incurred 
to date  the company has expended approximately million on year projects 
risk analysis similar to most large business enterprises  the company is dependent upon its own internal computer technology and relies upon timely performance by its key business partners and major suppliers 
although the full consequences are not known  the failure of either the company s systems or those of material third parties to conform to the year  as noted above  could impair the company s ability to deliver product to its stores in a timely fashion  which could result in potential lost sales opportunities and additional expenses 
the company s year project seeks to identify and minimize this risk and includes testing of internally generated systems and purchased hardware and software to ensure  to the extent feasible  all such systems will function before and after the year contingency plans the company has developed contingency plans  which will attempt to minimize disruption to the company s operations in the event of year computer systems failures 
while no assurances can be given  because of the company s extensive efforts to formulate and carry out an effective year program  the company believes its program will be completed on a timely basis and should effectively minimize disruption to the company s operations due to year issues
