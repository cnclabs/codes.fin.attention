item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  the description of the company s business operations  and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the matters discussed in this annual report contain forward looking statements regarding the company s future business which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and government regulations 
these issues  and other factors  which may be identified from time to time in the company s reports filed with the sec  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
in a restructuring completed on december   the company acquired all of the assets and businesses formerly held by ffp partners  except that the real estate used in its retail operations was retained by ffp partners 
ffp partners also retained certain liabilities  principally bank debt and debt secured by the retained real estate 
all other liabilities including trade accounts payable  money orders payable  accrued expenses  deferred income taxes  obligations under capital leases and other debt secured by various equipment were transferred to the company 
the businesses transferred to the company include the operation of convenience stores  truck stops  and self service motor fuel concessions at independently operated convenience stores  motor fuel wholesaling activities  the sale of money orders through the outlets operated by the company and third party agents  and the operation of a motor fuel terminal and processing facility 
the real estate retained by ffp partners is leased to the company for use in the conduct of its retail convenience store and motor fuel operations 
the selected financial data that accompanies this discussion reflects the historical operations of ffp partners to which the company succeeded in connection with the aforementioned restructuring 
however  the financial data for years prior to is not comparable to prior years in the following respects rental expense is included in  but not in prior years  for the leasing of the real properties retained by ffp partners in the december restructuring  depreciation expense related to such real properties is not included for nor will it be incurred in future years  but is included for prior years  and interest income received by the company from its note receivable from ffp partners is included in but not in years prior to also in december  the company initially acquired additional convenience stores 
ten of the stores acquired were sold to an unrelated party concurrently with the closing of the purchase  and three other stores were sold to another unrelated party shortly thereafter  resulting in a net increase from these transactions of stores 
the purchase of the stores was completed on a store by store basis throughout december  therefore  their operations had little impact on results 
the results from operations from these stores had a positive impact on results in and are expected to continue to have a similar impact in future years 
the company reports its results of operations using a fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in december 
most fiscal years have weeks  but some consist of weeks 
fiscal years    and were week years  while fiscal year was a week year 
this variation in time periods most affects revenues and related costs of sales and salary costs  as other expenses such as rent and utilities are usually recorded on a monthly basis 
however  differences in the number of weeks in a fiscal year should be considered in reviewing the financial data 
business segments the company and its subsidiaries conduct business in two primary business segments i the operation of retail convenience stores  truck stops  and motor fuel concessions at independently operated convenience stores  money orders sales through company stores and third party agents  underground tank monitoring and testing  and motor fuel wholesaling activities the retail and wholesale operations  and ii the operation of a motor fuel terminal and processing facility the terminal operations 
each of these business segments is subject to differing opportunities and challenges 
the following table sets forth certain information about each segment s financial information in   and retail and terminal wholesale operations eliminations consolidated in thousands revenues from external sources    revenues from other segment   depreciation and amortization   interest income  interest expense   income loss before income taxes   total assets    capital expenditures   revenues from external sources   revenues from other segment   depreciation and amortization   interest income interest expense   income loss before income taxes total assets    capital expenditures    revenues from external sources   revenues from other segment depreciation and amortization   interest income interest expense   income loss before income taxes   total assets    capital expenditures    the company plans to expand its retail and wholesale operations in by seeking the acquisition of additional convenience stores if acceptable terms and properties can be found 
one such acquisition has already been made 
in february  the company acquired the operations of additional convenience stores and two additional truck stops 
eleven of these stores are located in san antonio  texas  and the remainder are located in smaller towns throughout the state of texas 
eleven of the stores are third party leasehold locations where the company purchased the existing leasehold interest 
the company s purchase of those leasehold interests was financed with a third party lender consisting of four fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  maturity dates ranging from to months  interest accruing at per annum  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
real estate at stores was purchased by ffp partners and immediately leased to the company under year leases 
the company s rental payments under those leases equal  per month 
the company guaranteed the acquisition indebtedness of ffp partners of  which amount is no greater than the company s aggregate rental payments to ffp partners over the initial year period of the leases 
the company expects that its operation of these additional stores will provide funds to repay its acquisition financing and also enhance its cash flows from operations  but future results are subject to risks and are not assured 
the company plans to expand its activities in in connection with its terminal operations with the commencement of an ethanol blending process at the terminal 
although management believes that this new ethanol blending will be profitable  it is a new processing procedure at the terminal and therefore subject to economic risks  accordingly  future results are not assured 
compared with the company incurred a net loss of  in  compared to net income of  in the major reasons for this decline are the following additional bad debt losses of  were incurred in in money order operations a substantial portion of which the company is currently seeking to recover  rent expense of  was paid in to ffp partners in the leasing of real property for certain of the company s retail sites  compared to none in  which was partially offset by an increase in interest income of  and a decrease in depreciation of  the company s terminal operations segment incurred a loss before income taxes of  in  compared to a segment loss of  and an income tax benefit of only  was recorded in compared to an  income tax benefit in the company s total revenues increased to  a increase over total revenues of  this increase resulted primarily from a  increase in merchandise sales  which was primarily attributable to merchandise sales at the additional stores acquired in december retail motor fuel sales increased by  gallons in over due to sales from the additional convenience stores acquired in december in addition  wholesale fuel sales increased by  gallons over the prior year 
total motor fuel sales  in dollars  were flat in  when compared to  because motor fuel sales prices were lower in as compared to the company sold more motor fuel volume in  which offset the price decline 
in addition  the company s margin on such sales increased by  over levels 
retail fuel gross profit increased in absolute and per gallon terms 
retail margins showed a cent per gallon increase in over and was principally attributable to higher margins in the areas served by the additional stores acquired by the company in december a cent per gallon decline in wholesale margins resulted primarily from competitive pricing pressure from other wholesalers in the texas wholesale markets served by the company 
merchandise sales improved from  in to  in this large increase resulted principally from an increase of stores in the average number of convenience stores in  a increase over  which was partially offset by a decline in the average weekly merchandise sales to  per convenience store 
major categories of merchandise sales in were grocery sales  deli and restaurant sales  soft drink sales  beer and wine sales  cigarette sales  fast food sales  and money order equipment and supplies 
the company s gross profit on merchandise sales increased by  in this increase came from two sources the additional merchandise gross profit realized from the stores acquired in december  and an increase in gross margin on merchandise sales to in  compared to in this increase in merchandise margins follows a five year trend of increasing merchandise margins 
for example  merchandise margins have increased from in to in  representing a overall increase during that five year period 
miscellaneous revenues increased significantly to  in  representing a  increase in as compared to  primarily due to the greater number of stores in operation for the full year 
miscellaneous revenues is one area of operations that the company emphasizes in its efforts to improve profitability 
categories of miscellaneous income include money order fees  lottery ticket revenue  pay phone and calling card income  automated teller machine income  gasoline excise tax handling fees  check cashing fees  game machine income  gain or loss on property sales  interest income  scale charges and copier income 
direct store expenses those costs directly attributable to the operation of retail outlets  such as salaries and other personnel costs  supplies  utilities  rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance  and commissions paid to the operators of the self service motor fuel outlets increased by  in  compared to direct store expenses in this increase was primarily attributable to the stores acquired during december the remaining increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to increased wage costs  related to the federally mandated minimum wage increase which took effect on september  since the december restructuring of ffp partners  all of the real estate used in the company s retail operations was retained by ffp partners and is now leased to the company 
as a result  rent expense increased by  in general and administrative expenses increased  in over of this amount   resulted from increased bad debt expense arising out of the money order operations  a substantial portion of which the company is currently seeking to recover 
in addition  a full year of costs were incurred in for wages and initial operating costs at the company s fuel terminal and processing facility opened in mid  and for field supervisory personnel added in december to manage the additional stores acquired in late depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  in reflecting the impact of increased charges related to the company s significant capital expenditures in the last three years  primarily related to the upgrading of the company s underground storage tanks to meet environmental regulatory requirements  the start of operations at the company s fuel terminal in mid  and depreciation of equipment acquired in the late acquisition of convenience stores 
offsetting the foregoing was a decline in depreciation expense of  attributable to buildings that were retained by ffp partners in the december restructuring 
a  decrease in net interest expense in  as compared to  was the result of lower interest rates during and the receipt of interest income of  from ffp partners in the second half of partially offsetting that reduction in interest expense was additional interest incurred as a result of increased borrowings to fund the company s financing of its december purchase of convenience stores  investment in its fuel terminal and processing facility  and purchase of equipment to upgrade its underground storage tanks to meet environmental standards that became effective in december as a partnership  the company paid no federal or state income tax prior to the december restructuring of ffp partners 
rather  the income or loss of the company was allocated to its partners to be included in their respective income tax returns 
because the company expected to become taxable as a corporation beginning in  applicable accounting pronouncements required it to record a tax liability for those taxes it would have to pay on items of income and expense recognized for financial reporting purposes before but which would be recognized for tax reporting purposes in or later years 
accordingly  the company provided for these deferred tax expenses in its consolidated statements of operations  while the current tax benefit of the deferral of the recognition of income  or the acceleration of expenses  for tax purposes was allocated the company s partners 
the primary items giving rise to differences between financial and tax reporting were differences in the tax bases and depreciation methods of the company s fixed assets 
in  the company was able to substantially shorten the lives over which certain buildings used in its retail operations were depreciated for tax purposes 
the benefit of this additional tax depreciation was allocated to the company s partners while the company was required to record a deferred tax expense related to it 
in connection with the december restructuring of ffp partners  the ownership of the depreciable real property that gave rise to the large deferred tax provision in was retained by ffp partners  which continues as a publicly traded limited partnership  and not distributed to the company 
accordingly  the deferred taxes attributable to these buildings were reversed in as a corporation  the company provides for both current and deferred federal and state income tax expense on its earnings or benefit on its loss 
for the company recorded an income tax benefit of  compared with a  decline in the company s total revenues in from the level was principally due to a  decline in motor fuel sales 
this decline in fuel sales resulted from the absence in of a large volume of lower margin wholesale sales to a customer that purchases from the company infrequently along with the effect of generally lower fuel sales prices in as compared to the price of motor fuel also dropped steadily throughout wholesale fuel sales declined  gallons due to the absence of the sales mentioned above  while retail fuel sales increased  over the prior year due to the sales from the convenience stores acquired in december although revenues from fuel sales declined  the margin on such sales increased  over levels 
both retail and wholesale fuel gross profit increased in absolute and per gallon terms 
the cent increase in retail margin per gallon in over was attributable to the lessening in the fourth quarter of the year of the competitive pricing pressures that had existed over the prior months 
the cent per gallon improvement in wholesale margins resulted primarily from the absence of the low margin sales referred to previously 
partially offsetting the decline in fuel sales was a  increase in merchandise sales in this increase primarily resulted from the additional merchandise sales of the stores acquired in december excluding the sales from the acquired stores  merchandise sales decreased  reflecting the absence of merchandise sales from the outlets which the company sold to independent operators during and excluding the impact of the stores acquired in december  the company operated an average of six fewer stores in than although overall merchandise sales declined  excluding the impact of the stores acquired in december  average weekly merchandise sales per store at the company s convenience stores excluding the impact of the stores acquired in december increased to  the company s gross profit on merchandise sales increased by  in about of this increase came from the additional merchandise gross profit from the stores acquired in december 
the remainder is attributable to the increase in average weekly merchandise sales  mentioned above  and the increase in gross margin on merchandise sales to in from in miscellaneous revenues declined  in  as compared to  primarily due to the lesser amount of gains recognized on sales of convenience store merchandise operations to independent operators 
of the  increase in direct store expenses   related to the additional expenses attributable to the stores acquired during december the remaining  increase in these expenses are primarily attributable to increased wage costs  related to the federally mandated minimum wage increase which took effect on september  general and administrative expenses increased  in over of this amount   were legal  accounting  and other expenses directly attributable to the december restructuring of ffp partners 
excluding those costs  general and administrative expenses increased  primarily as a result of increased wage costs due to the opening of the company s fuel terminal and processing facility in mid and an increase in field supervisory personnel added in december to manage the stores acquired in december  offset by reductions in bad debt expense and advertising and promotion costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  in reflecting the impact of increased charges related to the company s significant capital expenditures in and  primarily related to the upgrading of the company s underground storage tanks to meet environmental regulatory requirements  and the start of operations at the company s fuel terminal in mid the  increase in interest expense in  as compared to  was the result of the generally higher level of interest rates during the period and to the company s higher debt levels 
the increased borrowings funded the company s investment in its fuel terminal and processing facility and purchase of equipment to upgrade its underground storage tanks to meet environmental standards that were effective at the end of in  the company was able to substantially shorten the lives over which certain buildings used in its retail operations were depreciated for tax purposes 
as discussed above  the benefit of this additional tax depreciation was allocated to the company s partners while the company was required to record a deferred tax expense related to it 
in connection with the december restructuring of ffp partners  the ownership of the real estate that gave rise to the large deferred tax provision in was retained by ffp partners 
accordingly  the deferred taxes attributable to these buildings was reversed in this reversal of deferred tax expense accounted for the significant change in the deferred provision between and liquidity and capital resources the majority of the company s working capital is provided from two sources i cash flows generated from its operating activities  and ii borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company believes that operating activities  coupled with available short term working capital facilities  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund current commitments for operating and capital expenditure programs  as well as to service debt requirements 
actual capital expenditure funding will be dependent on the level of cash flow generated from operating activities and the funds available from financings 
the company s notes payable at year end aggregated  such amount was comprised of the following a bank revolving credit facility  and term loan  debt  incurred in june to refinance its acquisition financing incurred in purchasing additional convenience stores in december  an equipment loan  incurred in april to refinance a previous capitalized lease obligation  and other debt  to finance the installation of sewer equipment in a prior year 
of the total notes payable   is classified as short term  and  is long term debt 
the bank revolving credit line provides for borrowings up to  with the amount available at any time limited to a borrowing base equal to of the company s trade receivables plus of the company s inventories 
on december   the borrowing base was  the revolving credit facility and term loan both bear interest at the lender s prime rate  payable monthly 
the term loan requires monthly principal payments of  and both loans mature in november the loans are subject to a loan and security agreement between the lender  the company and two subsidiaries of the company 
the agreement contains numerous  but typical  restrictive covenants including financial covenants relating to the maintenance of a specified minimum tangible net worth  a maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio  and a minimum cash flow coverage ratio  all as defined in the agreement 
as of year end  the company was not in compliance with certain requirements under the loan agreement for the principal reason that the assets and operations of ffp partners are no longer included in the financial covenant calculations 
the lender has waived declaring a default due to such noncompliance and amended the applicable restrictive covenants to place the company in compliance subsequent to december  the loans under the agreement are secured by the company s trade accounts receivable  inventories  and its equipment not otherwise encumbered  and by a negative pledge of its other assets  and a collateral assignment of the company s deed of trust lien against the real properties of ffp partners 
in june  the company refinanced its december purchase of convenience stores 
that financing consists of fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  an interest rate of per annum  maturities ranging from to months  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
the proceeds of these loans were used to repay a bridge loan with an original principal balance of  used to finance the purchase of the outlets and for general corporate purposes 
effective june  the company  the company s primary bank lender and ffp partners reached an agreement to restructure the revolving credit facility and term loan due to the lender 
in connection with the restructuring of ffp partners in december  both the company and ffp partners retained the liability for this debt as both entities were primary obligors on the loans 
in accordance with the june agreement  the lender made a loan to the company  the company made a loan to ffp partners  and ffp partners repaid the balance of its debt to the lender  all of which was effective on june  this transaction included the execution of a promissory note by ffp partners payable to the company in the amount of  the then current balance on the debt due to the lender  which was recorded by the company as a note receivable from affiliate  and ffp partners was released by the lender from all obligations under the loan and security agreement 
as a result of the june transaction  joint liability no longer exists on the debt obligations to the lender  and the reduction of  to the company s stockholders equity for such liability was removed 
at december   the company was indebted to the lender in the amount of  and owned a promissory note from ffp partners with an unpaid principal balance of  the interest rate and repayment terms of the company s loan to ffp partners mirror such terms of the company s debt to the lender  including a maturity date of november the revised agreement with the lender also required that the loan be secured by real estate owned by ffp partners  which was pledged to the company and then also pledged by the company to the lender as additional collateral on the company s debt to the lender 
ffp partners makes monthly principal payments to the company of  plus accrued interest on the unpaid balance at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate 
all proceeds received by the company from its loan to ffp partners are required to be applied to the balance of the company s debt to the lender 
the company is currently seeking to refinance all or a substantial portion of its bank revolving credit facility and term loan described above in the second quarter of although the company executed a letter of intent with a lender in april to obtain such refinancing  it has not received a binding commitment for such refinancing 
accordingly  such refinancing is not assured 
as proposed  such refinancing loan would be fully amortized over years in equal  monthly installments and be secured by approximately of the company s convenience stores and truck stops 
the company has been advised by ffp partners that it expects to refinance its existing indebtedness to the company during the second quarter of although ffp partners obtained a favorable response to such refinancing from a lender in march  it has not received a binding commitment for such refinancing 
accordingly  the company s receipt of proceeds from such refinancing is not assured 
when the company operated as a publicly traded limited partnership  it made cash distributions to its partners from time to time  a portion of which represented the amount the partners were required to pay in income taxes on the company s income that was allocated to them 
with the change in the company s tax status to a corporation  management does not currently anticipate that any dividends will be paid on the company s common stock within the next twelve months 
the company s cash flows from operating activities were  in  an increase of  over this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in cash flows as a result of operating an average of more convenience stores in than in the company s investment in property and equipment during was  a decrease of  compared to the company s capital expenditures were principally to refurbish the company s stores and to continue the upgrading of the company s underground storage tanks to meet the environmental regulations for underground storage tanks by the december deadline 
capital expenditures decreased in because no major purchase of additional convenience stores was made in as were made in  when an convenience stores were purchased 
in addition  the company reduced its net long term debt and net capital lease obligations by  
the company paid for its capital expenditures and reduced its long term debt and capital lease obligations from operating cash flow 
subject to obtaining satisfactory deal terms and suitable financing  the company intends to purchase additional convenience stores in and beyond as the convenience store industry goes through as period of consolidation 
any such acquisitions will impact the company s financial results and liquidity 
for example  the company expects that the operation of the additional stores acquired in february will provide funds to repay its acquisition indebtedness and enhance its cash flow  but future results are not assured 
the company is party to commodity futures contracts and forward contracts to buy and sell fuel  both of which are used principally to satisfy balances owed on exchange agreements 
both of these types of contracts have off balance sheet risk as they involve the risk of dealing with others and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk associated with unmatched positions and market fluctuations 
the open positions under these contracts were not significant at year end see note to the consolidated financial statements 
over the last few years  the company s money order sales have increased significantly 
for example  money order payables at the end of fiscal year were  compared to money order payables of  at the end of fiscal money order payables represent those sales of money orders for which the payee of the money order has not yet requested payment 
although the company collects money order receipts on a daily basis on sales of money orders made by its own stores  the company relies on receiving timely payment from its third party money order sales agents 
in the company incurred an additional bad debt loss from its money order operations 
the company is attempting to recover a substantial portion of these losses that were attributable to two reasons bank encoding errors and fraudulent actions by a third party money order agent 
the company s failure to receive money order payments from an agent on a timely basis could negatively impact the company s liquidity 
the company had negative working capital of  at the end of  compared to a negative  at year end the company has traditionally been able to operate its business with minimal or negative working capital  principally because most sales are for cash and it has received payment terms from vendors 
the change resulted primarily from a  increase in money order payables  a  increase in accrued expenses and a  increase in trade receivables 
the company believes that the availability of funds from its store operations  its revolving line of credit as discussed above and its traditional use of trade credit will permit operations to be conducted in a customary manner 
year issues the year issue yk is the result of computer software programs being coded to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some of computer programs that have date sensitive coding may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this coding could result in system failures or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations 
the company has approached the yk issue in phases 
a yk project office manager  together with strong support from management  has designed a yk work plan that is currently being implemented 
the yk work plan includes identifying and inventorying all year tasks and items  assigning priorities to all tasks and items  remediation of information systems is application code  testing and reintegration to production  as well as testing all replaced systems software and non remediated applications  contacting third party vendors to verify their compliance and perform selected interface tests with major vendors  determining the company s yk responsibilities to its subsidiaries and affiliates  and establishing contingency alternatives assuming worst case scenarios 
the company continues to progress favorably in its completion of the various tasks and target dates identified in the yk work plan 
the company believes it has identified and prioritized all major yk related items 
in addition  many non is  merchandise  equipment  financial institution  insurance and public utility vendors are being contacted  inquiring as to their readiness and the readiness of their respective vendors 
the company will perform follow up efforts with the above vendors as required 
testing compliance with major vendors is now being planned 
the following reflects management s assessment of the company s yk state of readiness on december  estimated estimated percentage completion completed date phase internal is and non is systems and equipment awareness dec assessment jun remediation sep testing oct contingency planning sep suppliers  customers and third party providers awareness identify companies may assessment questionnaire completed by major suppliers aug assessment review with third party providers aug review contractual commitments jul risk assessment jun contingency planning sep testing as applicable sep the company s estimates are judgmental and subject to error 
it believes that work should be significantly finished at the estimated completion date  but the company will continue to reevaluate awareness  send follow up questionnaires and update contingency plans as considered necessary 
the company estimates that the cost of the yk project will be approximately  to  of which about one half will be capital costs 
the costs incurred to date approximate  with the remaining cost for outside consultants software and hardware applications to be funded through operating cash flow 
this estimate includes costs related to the upgrade and or replacement of computer software and hardware  costs of remediated code testing and test result verification  and the reintegration to production of all remediated applications 
in addition  the costs include the testing of applications and software currently certified as yk compliant 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project  which are primarily the related payroll costs for the is and various user personnel participating in the project 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk process  primarily due to issues surrounding the yk readiness of third party suppliers and vendors  a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult to determine at this time 
the company does not anticipate more than temporary isolated disruptions attributed to yk issues to affect either the company or its primary vendors 
the company is concentrating on four critical business areas in order to identify  evaluate and determine the scenarios requiring the development of contingency plans merchandise ordering and receipt  petroleum products ordering and receipt  disruption of power at retail sites  and cash collection and disbursement systems 
to the extent vendors are unable to deliver products due to their own year issues  the company believes it will generally have alternative sources for comparable products and does not expect to experience any material business disruptions 
although considered unlikely  the failure of public utility companies to provide telephone and electrical service could have material consequences 
contingency planning efforts will escalate as the company continues to receive and evaluate responses from all of its primary merchandise vendors and service providers 
these contingency plans are scheduled to be complete by september the costs of the yk project and the date on which the company plans to complete the yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these forward looking estimates will be achieved and the actual costs 
vendor compliance could differ materially from the company s current expectations and result in a material financial risk 
in addition  while the company is making significant efforts in addressing all anticipated yk risks within its control  this event is unprecedented 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the yk issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
inflation and seasonality the company believes inflation has not had a material effect on operating results in recent years except for the upward pressure placed on wages  primarily store wages  by the federal minimum wage increases which took effect in and operations for the foreseeable future are not expected to be significantly impacted by inflation 
generally  increased costs of in store merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices to customers 
the price of motor fuel  adjusted for inflation  has declined over recent years 
significant increases in the retail price of motor fuels could reduce fuel demand and the company s gross profit on fuel sales 
the company s businesses are subject to seasonal influences  with higher sales being experienced in the second and third quarters of the year as customers tend to purchase more motor fuel and convenience items  such as soft drinks  other beverages  and snack items  during the warmer months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to insignificant market risks related to variable interest rates and commodity prices 
although interest expense on the company s bank loan containing the revolving credit facility and term loan is calculated at the prime rate of interest  which is subject to change  the company is also the holder of a note receivable from ffp partners containing payment terms which mirror that of the company s debt 
thus  any increase in interest expense of the company attributable to an increase in the prime rate will be offset by an increase in its interest income 
the company is also subject to the market risk of increasing commodity prices and sometimes is a party to commodity futures and forward contracts to hedge that risk 
however  open positions under these futures and forward contracts were not significant at year end or see note to the consolidated financial statements
