same store customer counts increased at village inn and at bakers square 
consolidated restaurant sales decreased in versus the company operated  on average  approximately eleven fewer restaurants in compared to due to restaurant closures 
a comparable same store sales decline of also contributed to the overall decrease in sales 
the bakers square concept registered a decrease in same store sales and a decrease in customer counts when compared to same store sales and customer counts in the village inn concept were respectively up and over the prior year 
consolidated restaurant operating profit increased in versus bakers square accounted for the majority of the improvement as a result of increased sales coupled with programs to control waste and gain efficiencies 
village inn s restaurant operating profit improved due largely to reduced food costs 
consolidated restaurant operating profit increased in versus bakers square s restaurant operating profit increased over the prior year  while profit as a percent of sales increased from in to in village inn s profit improvement was versus the prior year  with profit as a percent of sales increasing from to 
programs developed to improve efficiencies  control food costs and minimize controllable operating costs added to the profit improvements realized by the closure of unprofitable units 
franchise income increased in versus due to four new franchise units offset partially by the closing of two franchise units 
net franchise income was basically unchanged from to  as reduced franchise fees were offset by lower administrative costs 
general and administrative expense was of revenues in and in the increase of million  or  was largely due to higher bonus payouts to operating management as the result of improved operating results 
general and administrative expenses  as a percent of restaurant sales  remained virtually unchanged in from at 
however  actual expenses decreased million  or  as a result of the continuing programs of cost containment and improved efficiencies of support functions 
interest expense decreased for versus and for versus due to significantly reduced levels of borrowing and reduced capital lease interest 
other income for decreased from due to disposal of some subleased units and lower interest earned on notes receivable 
other income for decreased from due to lower interest earned on notes receivable and investments 
in  the company recorded a  asset disposal charge related to its decision to close its angel s diner restaurants after determining that its strategy of using that concept to invigorate underperforming restaurant properties was not economically viable 
the charge reduced the carrying values of related assets to net realizable value and provided for closure and carrying costs 
in  the company recorded a  charge related primarily to a plan to close and dispose of underperforming restaurants and discontinue a portion of the company s manufacturing and distribution activities 
also  included was the recognition of the impairment of the carrying values on four properties and an accrual for administrative restructuring costs 
as of october   all of the restaurants scheduled for disposition had been closed 
during fiscal  and  one  six and two additional units were closed  respectively 
operating results for the closed restaurants for the past three fiscal years were as follows bakers square sales   restaurant operating profit loss   village inn sales    restaurant operating profit loss   angel s sales   restaurant operating profit loss   total sales    restaurant operating profit loss    the company closed its bakery facilities in denver  colorado  and orlando  florida  in the effective income tax rates used for financial reporting were in  in and in the higher rate benefit in was largely due to the greater impact of tax credits  primarily the fica tax credit relative to pre tax income loss 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of funds is cash provided by operations 
cash flow from operations increased in due primarily to higher operating income 
the company s working capital is generally in a deficit position because  like most restaurant businesses  substantially all sales are for cash  while credit is received from trade suppliers 
furthermore  the company has not maintained large excess cash balances  but rather has utilized available cash for capital spending  repayment of borrowings or the repurchase of its common stock 
the company supplements cash provided by operations with bank borrowings and occasional lease financing 
during fiscal  the company reduced its outstanding debt borrowings by million 
at november  the company had no outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facility  with million available for additional direct advances 
at november   the company had properties which it was trying to dispose of 
three of these properties were owned in fee and the rest were leased 
the company intends to sell the fee properties over the next year and approximately million of proceeds are expected to be realized from their sale 
the company does not anticipate significant proceeds from the disposition of the leased properties 
it is expected that the majority of the leased properties will be disposed of through sublease over the next six to eighteen months 
cash carrying costs of approximately  are expected to be incurred over that period 
the company expects to sublease six of the properties at rentals lower than the company s obligations under the prime leases 
those sublease losses will be funded over the remaining years of the leases and the company does not anticipate any material affect on the company s liquidity 
in   shares of the company s common stock were repurchased for  under authorizations approved by the board of directors 
at november   authorization to repurchase an additional  common shares was available 
future purchases with respect to this authorization may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be dependent upon various business and financial considerations 
capital expenditures in totaled million and consisted of million for construction of new restaurants  million for improvements to existing restaurants  and million for other support related projects 
capital expenditures of million are planned for ten to twelve new restaurant openings are planned during cash flow from operations  funds available under a bank credit facility  or other financing sources are expected to be adequate for planned capital projects and any repurchases of common stock authorized by the board 
at november   the company had  of net deferred tax assets  the majority of which relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling  the company also has investment tax credit itc carryforwards totaling  which expire in and the company has established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards because the itc carryforwards are not expected to be realized and only a portion of the operating loss carryforwards are expected to be applied against future taxable income before they expire 
the remaining valuation allowance at november   is based on an assumption that the company will report taxable income in of approximately million 
to the extent actual taxable income for fiscal varies from the assumed amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be required 
actual taxable income for fiscal was approximately million 
management is currently pursuing certain tax planning strategies it believes can be implemented to increase taxable income currently projected for fiscal to at least million 
however  there can be no assurance these tax planning strategies will be successfully implemented and the adequacy of the allowance is principally dependent on the actual amount of taxable income ultimately reported for fiscal vicorp has guaranteed certain leases for restaurant properties sold to others in and restaurant leases of certain franchisees 
minimum future rental payments remaining under these leases were approximately million and million as of november  and october   respectively 
these guarantees are included in the definition of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk of accounting loss  however  the company has not been required to make payments with respect to these guarantees and presently has no reason to believe any payments will be required in the future 
the company believes it is impracticable to estimate the fair value of these financial guarantees eg  amounts the company could pay to remove the guarantees because the company has no present intention or need to attempt settlement of any of the guarantees 
yk the company completed a review of its computer systems during fiscal  resulting in a decision to replace a large portion of the existing systems at a cost of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount was spent in fiscal the new systems are year compliant 
as of january   the company implemented year compliant systems at its corporate headquarters 
these new erp enterprise resource planning systems have been designed to provide the infrastructure to support corporate and field based systems 
a system wide rollout to all restaurants of a new back of house point of sale pos system  as well as a modification of front of house systems to be year compliant  is planned to begin in march with a targeted completion date of september  in house testing of the new pos system is complete and a pilot store test will begin february  the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan for restaurant operations should the initial store testing and the rollout fall behind schedule 
the company is currently conducting a review of its physical facilities in order to identify potential areas of embedded technology heating  lighting  fixtures  and equipment  communications systems  waste treatment  emergency backup systems  etc 
that may not be year compliant 
the company believes its exposure is limited in this area and is formulating plans to address any issues that may surface 
with respect to third parties  the company has been in contact with and is preparing written communications to send to all third parties considered critical to the company s ongoing operations 
written communication will request written confirmation from mission critical third parties of reasonable assurance that plans are being developed to ensure year readiness 
reasonable assurance will include verification that critical third party vendors have a plan in place for review of year readiness for their supplier base 
to the extent that critical third party vendors do not provide the company with satisfactory evidence of readiness  contingency plans will be developed and implemented by the company by december  the company has sent written notice to franchisees regarding the need for year readiness 
approximately one half of the company s franchise restaurants have plans in place to replace non compliant restaurant based systems with the company s new year ready pos system 
all installations are targeted to be completed by october  the company does not believe the costs related to the year readiness project will be material to its financial position or results of operations 
however  the cost of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were made utilizing numerous assumptions including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
unanticipated failures by vendors and franchisees  as well as the failure by the company to execute its own remediation efforts  could have a material adverse effect on the cost of the project and its completion date 
in addition  any such unforeseen occurrences  if combined with failures of other third parties or public services beyond the company s control  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the forward looking estimates contained herein will be achieved and the actual cost could differ materially from the projections contained herein 
in the event they are needed  the company s contingency plans  in management s estimate  will be in place by december  management outlook the mid scale segment of the restaurant industry remains extremely competitive 
improvements in future operating performance will be primarily dependent upon the company s ability to increase comparable sales  especially given the significant profit impact associated with incremental sales at existing restaurants 
cost controls will also play a significant factor in future profit growth 
in addition  numerous external factors could have a significant impact on future performance  including  but not limited to  food costs  labor availability  site availability  the economy  the weather and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates  mandated benefits and taxes 
historically  the company has mitigated the effects of inflation through cost controls and periodic price increases 
management believes it will be able to minimize the effects of future inflation through similar measures  although such price increases will be subject to competitive constraints and other business considerations 
certain matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as the company believes  anticipates  expects or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe the company s future plans  objectives or goals are also forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are described in close proximity to such statements and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated 
shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements made herein are only made as of the date of this report and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances
