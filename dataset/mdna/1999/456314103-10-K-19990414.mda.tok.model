general the registrant continued to pursue a growth strategy in the waste management services arena servicing over  customer locations throughout the country and building a base of approximately  vendors 
this strategy will allow for diversity of business opportunities so that the registrant is not as dependent upon the profitability of the recycling division 
this diversity has helped to stabilize revenues and gross profit during a period of time when commodity prices fluctuate and affect the ferrous and non ferrous markets 
this strategy is evidenced by the purchase of the management services accounts of mgm services  inc mgm in september the impact of this acquisition for the full year of added approximately  in revenue 
much of management s focus and attention now and in the future is directed towards the growth of this business segment through an acquisition strategy 
it is management s plan to expand in the management services segment in at the same time  the registrant will be seeking more operational cost control  increased efficiency in the information technology area and emphasize sales and marketing efforts 
management continues to maintain and grow the recycling business  although not actively seeking any further acquisitions or mergers 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the registrant held cash and cash equivalents of  the registrant currently maintains a working capital line of credit with bol in the amount of  indebtedness under this credit facility accrues interest at bol s prime rate as promulgated from time to time 
the maturity date under this agreement is july  the credit line is collateralized by eligible accounts receivable  inventories  equipment and the personal guarantees of the chief executive officer of the registrant  harry kletter 
as of december    was outstanding under the credit facility as compared to  as of december  as consideration for the acquisition of the metal center  the registrant provided two notes payable to the sellers in the amount of  each  payable one half on january  and one half on or before july  the payments were made timely 
results of operations the following table presents  for the years indicated  the percentage relationship which certain captioned items in the registrant s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues and other pertinent data year ended december  statements of operations data total revenue cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the revenue in was  representing an increase of  or compared to the management services business grew to  by increasing the same account and new account business serviced to over  accounts nationwide 
recycling revenues grew to  contributing to much of the remaining overall growth 
the major products include recycling of copper  aluminum and brass  referred to herein as non ferrous scrap 
the ferrous recycling business increased its revenues by through an increase in direct sales to mills and more aggressive purchasing practices 
the total cost of goods sold was  increasing  or compared to the cost of goods sold in management services increased by versus an increase in recycling cost of goods sold of 
the increase in management services mirrored the sales increase within one percentage point  but the major cost of sales impact was realized in the recycling business 
commodity prices of the ferrous and non ferrous markets began to decline during the third and fourth quarters of the influx of foreign steel due to the depressed asian market caused domestic commodity pricing to plummet 
due to the lack of domestic steel production  many of the regional steel mills  which consume the registrant s ferrous product  had limited scrap purchasing during the fourth quarter 
the registrant s inventory volume increased due to the local dismantling of an automotive plant 
offsetting this quantity increase in inventory is a decrease in inventory market value 
the registrant estimates that these factors had a  adverse impact on its operations 
the gross margin was  representing a decrease of  or as a percentage to revenue a decrease 
a slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage to revenue from to was realized in the management services segment due to some fixed fee contracts which experienced store location growth during the year 
the recycling division experienced a decrease in gross margin as a percentage to revenue of due mainly to the declining commodity price index 
it is estimated that the decline in commodity values had an adverse gross margin impact on operations of approximately  the equipment sales leasing business incurred a decline in gross margins due to the changing mix of higher sales relative to the rental and leasing volume 
the selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from the increase was primarily attributable to goodwill and non compete amortization related to two recent acquisitions 
the loss from operations in resulted not only from the  due to inventory devaluation  but also from the additional  due to an aggregate of non cash charges made in financial condition at december  compared to december  trade accounts receivable increased  to  at december  this represents a increase while overall revenue increased 
average days outstanding in were days versus days in although there was a slight increase in days outstanding due to the revenue mix  it still reflects management focus on working capital through the liquidation of accounts receivable 
inventory increased  from  to  representing a 
increase 
the inventory of equipment and parts increased from  to  or a increase 
non ferrous materials inventory decreased to  and the inventory of ferrous materials increased or  the increase is due primarily to the purchase of a major ferrous scrap plant rework which occurred at the end of accounts payable trade increased  from december  to  as of december  this increase was due to higher volumes in operations 
as of december  the registrant s working capital deficit was  which represents a decrease of  from the total current assets increased  due to the  in accounts receivable and the  increase in cash 
the total current liabilities increased  affected primarily by total accounts payable increase of year ended december  compared to year ended december  the revenue in was  representing an increase of  or compared to the revenue from the newly acquired the metal center is included for six months and represented of the overall growth 
the major products include recycling of copper  aluminum and brass  referred to herein as non ferrous scrap 
except for equipment and corrugated recycling  all other existing businesses had solid growth contributing the remaining of the total 
one of the major contributors to the remaining growth was the ferrous recycling business  which includes iron and steel products 
recycling revenues grew to  through an increase in direct sales to mills and more aggressive purchasing practices 
the management services business grew to  by increasing the same account and new account business serviced from approximately  locations on december  to  locations on december  in addition  the management services business absorbed approximately additional locations from mgm in the last quarter 
the total cost of goods was  increasing  or compared to the cost of goods sold in management services increased by versus an increase in recycling cost of goods sold of 
this divergence was caused by the addition of the non ferrous business  which has typically a lower gross profit percentage than the existing business base 
secondly  the ferrous business spreads narrowed due to competitive pressures 
finally  the corrugated recycling business  while the most profitable product line in recycling and which showed an improved percentage gross margin in  experienced a drop in revenue during the equipment division had cost of goods sold of  or less in versus this cost decrease compares with a revenue decrease of 
the business experienced a cost decrease in equipment sales to approximately  while experiencing a increase in rental leasing 
the registrant has focused on the growth of the rental leasing portion of its business 
the gross margin was  representing a decrease of  in or from the gross margin was of revenue  which was lower than a reduced gross margin percentage of was experienced in management services due to some fixed fee contracts which experienced store location growth during the year 
finally  the recycling division experienced a gross profit decrease due to the new mix of non ferrous products and narrowing spreads on the ferrous products  and lower volume of corrugated scrap processing 
the equipment business had higher gross margin percentage  due to a favorable mix of higher rental and leasing business relative to equipment sales 
the selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased  as compared to as a percent of revenue  the selling  general  and administrative expenses dropped from of revenue to 
financial condition at december  compared to december  trade accounts receivable increased  to  at december  last year the registrant received a december receivable payment of  at year end  and as a result of this timing difference  trade receivables decreased from  to  therefore  the adjusted increase as of december  was  which represented a increase in this increase is significantly less than the increase in revenue  reflecting management focus on working capital through the liquidation of accounts receivable 
inventory increased  or to  of the total increase  equipment increased  and the non ferrous scrap inventory increased  due primarily to the new non ferrous operation 
the remaining increase was due to the purchase of a major ferrous scrap plant rework  which occurred at the end of the year  resulting in a temporary increase in ferrous unprocessed scrap inventory 
accounts payable trade increased  from december  to  as of december  this increase was due to higher volumes in all areas of the registrant s operations except corrugated paper 
as of december   the registrant s working capital was a deficit of  which represents a  decrease from the total current assets increased  due to the  increase in inventory  and the increase in total receivables of  offset by impact of the lower cash of  the current liabilities increased  affected primarily by total accounts payable increases of  and additional short term bank borrowings of  inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not and is not expected to have a significant impact on the registrant s operation in the near term 
the registrant has no long term fixed price contracts and the registrant believes it will be able to pass through most cost increases resulting from inflation to its customers 
the global economy  due to the devaluation of currency in various foreign nations and the limited commodity export opportunities  has created a weak domestic and international commodity market 
the registrant is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the commodity business 
in response to these economic conditions  the registrant has focused on the management consulting area of the business and is working to liquidate inventories while efforts are made to enhance gross margins

year risk factors in february  the registrant implemented its year project to address the potential problem with which substantially all users of automated data processing and information systems must deal 
this problem is mainly with older systems with only two digits to represent the year  rather than the full four digits 
older computer systems may not operate when the two digit year becomes as will happen in the year the registrant uses primarily microsoft software  which is already year compliant 
the registrant s accounting system is a dos based system  which could create the problem with 
the registrant in its endeavor to alleviate this dos based problem has contracted with the programmer of the registrant to write software to prevent this potential problem 
the software upgrade was completed in february and the registrant is testing the program to verify all is in working order 
by having the upgrade this far in advance it will enable the registrant to run a test system to avert any future problem 
the only software that the registrant uses that is beyond its control is edi or electronic data interchange 
the vendor of this software used by the registrant and many fortune companies  has promised a fix for this problem with its spring release software upgrade 
this area is the one over which the registrant has the least control 
if edi completes its upgrade as promised the registrant does not anticipate a year problem with this software 
in summary  the registrant s year project s goal and expectation are that all necessary modifications and upgrades will be in place  with the exception of edi that is promised by the vendor in spring the registrant currently has no reason to believe and does not anticipate the cost of year compliance to be a significant expense or problem 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the registrant will bear some minimal risk due to customers who fail to address the issues appropriately  or should the one vendor fail to meet the spring deadline 
presently  the registrant has no reason to believe that any of its customers are failing to take appropriate action to effect year compliance or that its software will be unable to perform as before with the upgrades 
the registrant believes that the worst case risk is a loss of its power source due to local utility year problems  resulting in computer malfunctions 
however  as a matter of corporate policy  the registrant nightly backs up all information systems 
historical records are maintained in hard copy and current and future transactions could be manually undertaken until restoration of the information systems occurs
