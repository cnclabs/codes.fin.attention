as a result  principal repayments on the company s loans outpaced the demand for the company s adjustable rate loan products 
the company sought to supplement loan production with loan purchases 
net loans receivable increased million  or  from million at december  to  million at december  loan origination activity in continued to be strong  totaling million compared to million in however  principal repayments experienced a increase during  totaling million compared to million during loan purchases totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the company supplements asset growth with the purchase of investment and mortgage backed securities

average balance  interest and average yields and costs the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities including the average yield on such assets and the average cost of such liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average month end balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods indicated 
during the periods indicated  nonaccrual loans are included in loans receivable 
the table also presents information for the periods indicated with respect to the company s net interest margin which has traditionally been used by financial institutions as an indicator of the profitability of their core operations 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average balance of interest earning assets and is a function of the company s interest rate spread the difference between the weighted average yield on its interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the ratio of its average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

net interest income decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in the company s interest rate spread from during to during partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the decrease in the company s interest rate spread was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on loans receivable 
the improvement in the average balance of interest earning assets was primarily the result of growth in the average balance of loans receivable 
interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from the decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average volume of interest earning assets 
interest income on loans receivable decreased million  or 
the decrease in interest income from loans receivable is attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  partially offset by a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable during the year ended december  refinancings continued to erode the company s higher yielding loans resulting in a shift in the company s loan portfolio into lower margin loans 
the company invests in adjustable rate loans to limit its exposure to interest rate risk and its ongoing strategy continues to focus on rebuilding the adjustable rate loan portfolio and on enhancing its interest rate margin through other areas of lending 
in order to be competitive with fixed rate loans in a low interest rate environment  however  adjustable rate loan products must be priced at a narrower spread over the company s cost of funds during the first year after origination resulting in additional pressure on the company s net interest margin 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased million  or 
nearly all of the decrease was attributable to the million decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities as management shifted the proceeds from sales and repayments into loans receivable and investment securities 
interest income on investment securities increased million  or 
the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance outstanding partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on the investment portfolio from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the decrease in the average yield on the investment portfolio was due to a decline in market interest rates between the periods 
interest expense 
total interest expense decreased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to decrease in interest expense on savings deposits which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on borrowed money 
interest expense on savings deposits decreased  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a million decrease in the average balance of savings deposits and a decrease in the average cost of deposits from during to during interest expense on borrowed money increased  for the year ended december  due to a million increase in the average balance partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of borrowed money from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the bulk of the company s new borrowings was made late in at rates lower than those on existing borrowings resulting in a decline in the average cost of borrowed money and only a small increase in the average balance 
provision for losses on loans 
the company recaptured million of loan loss reserves during the year ended december  by recording a credit to the provision for losses on loans 
the provision for losses on loans for the year ended december  totaled  the ots  after a examination  had required the company s texas subsidiary  first federal  to base its loan loss reserves on certain thrift industry average loss experiences that were significantly higher than the actual loss experience of first federal 
as a result of the ots examination  the ots removed these requirements  and the company  like other financial institutions  can now maintain its allowance for loan losses at an amount considered adequate to provide for potential losses in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb potential loan losses determined on the basis of management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio and its judgement as to the impact of economic conditions on the portfolio 
the evaluation by management includes consideration of past loan loss experiences and trends  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the current volume and condition of loans outstanding and the probability of collecting all amounts due

at december  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december  noninterest income 
total noninterest income for the year ended december  increased  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  gain on sales of loans increased million from  for to million for due to an increase in loan sales from million in to million in the increase in loan sales reflects the decline in interest rates on home mortgages which increased demand for fixed rate mortgage loans which the company originates for resale in the secondary market 
the gains on sales of loans represent origination and other fees retained by the company in connection with the sales of long term  fixed rate loans to institutional investors generally on an individual loan basis 
the company generally does not hold this type of loan in its portfolio due to its interest rate characteristics 
additionally  the company sells loans out of portfolio when loans convert from adjustable rate to fixed rate loans 
combined net gains on sales investment and mortgage backed securities declined  during due to a decrease in sales activity 
during  the company sold million in available for sale investment securities and million in available for sale mortgage backed securities  resulting in a combined net gain of  during  the company sold no investment securities and million in available for sale mortgage backed securities  resulting in a net gain on sale of mortgage backed securities of  following the purchases of texas heritage and l b financial  the company decided to restructure a large portion of its investment and mortgage backed securities portfolios during to strengthen the interest rate risk profile of its balance sheet

total noninterest expense increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  compensation and employee benefits increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  a large part of this increase was due to increased expenses associated with the company s employee stock ownership plan esop which increased  or  from million during to million during employee benefit expense associated with the company s esop is based on the average market value of the company s common stock  which increased approximately during compared to in addition  the company recorded a  charge to earnings during the second quarter of in connection with a change in the method of allocating benefits under the esop 
since the inception of the esop in  terminated employees who were participants were only allocated esop shares for the year of termination if they were employed by the company on the last day of the year 
such participants should have been allocated shares for the year of termination if they met certain hours of service requirements during that year 
the remainder of the increase was due to normal salary increases and the hiring of additional staff to implement the company s retail banking strategy 
compensation expense for was also reduced by the reversal of a  accrual for prior year bonuses which the board determined not to pay in view of declines in the market price of the company s stock 
occupancy expense increased  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to additional depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of additional premises and equipment and increases in rent expense and real estate taxes

also contributing to the improvement in net interest income has been a continued expansion in the net interest margin which the company attributes to several factors including the sale of lower yielding mortgage backed securities during the third quarter of  which provided the company with funding for additional loan originations in the texas market  and the upward adjustment of rates on the company s existing adjustable rate loan portfolio 
another significant contributor to the increase in loan portfolio yields during recent periods has been the company s construction and development lending through its texas subsidiary

 accounting for income taxes  which requires the asset and liability method 
the objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
interest rate risk sensitivity the primary component of the company s net income is derived from the spread between interest earning asset yields and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in a changing interest rate environment this spread can widen or narrow depending on the relative repricing and maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a principal strategy of the company has been to achieve acceptable net interest margins while decreasing the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rate fluctuations by matching more closely the cash flows and effective maturities or repricings of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
in implementing this strategy  the company has sought to increase the sensitivity of its assets to changing interest rates by emphasizing the origination and or purchase of adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with shorter terms and or adjustable rates 
the company also originates fixed rate mortgage loans which are generally sold in the secondary market 
the company actively manages the maturity and repricing characteristics of its liabilities and has sought to limit the interest sensitivity of its liabilities by emphasizing certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or longer 
the company has utilized short term borrowings from federal home loan banks to fund loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or balloon features 
interest rate risk at a given point in time can be represented by an interest rate sensitivity position gap 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which mature or reprice in each of the time periods shown 
the table projects principal prepayments for loans receivable using the historical prepayment rates for pools of similar loans and for mortgage backed securities using the historical prepayment rate for each individual security 
all other information is based on contractual terms to maturity or repricing 
this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
more than more than three months one year three months through through more than or less one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable      mortgage backed securities      investment securities and other interest earning assets      total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings deposits      borrowed money      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     ratio of cumulative gap to total assets a static gap report consists of an inventory of the dollar amounts of assets and liabilities that have the potential to mature or reprice within a particular period 
it does not consider the probability that potential maturities or repricings of interest sensitive accounts will occur  or to what extent 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in the company s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the ots also produces a similar analysis using its own model based upon data submitted on the quarterly thrift financial reports filed by the subsidiary thrifts 
the results of the ots model may vary from the company s internal model due to differences in assumptions utilized  including loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposits decay rates 
the following table sets forth the company s npv as of december  npv as of net portfolio value portfolio value of assets change in interest rates dollar percent npv change in in basis points rate shock amount change change ratio basis points dollars in thousands static  as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s npv and will differ from actual results 
income simulation analysis captures the potential and probability of the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities 
moreover  income simulation analysis measures the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
also  income simulation analysis permits management to assess the probable effects on balance sheet items of interest rate changes and management strategies that address such changes 
for these reasons  the company relies primarily upon income simulation analysis in measuring and managing exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity and capital resources the company currently has no business other than that of jefferson heritage 
the company s assets consist almost entirely of its investments in and advances to its subsidiaries 
its primary funding needs are for interest payments on certain bank debt and funds for the payment of dividends to stockholders 
to fund these activities  the company is dependent on future earnings  dividends from jefferson heritage  or borrowings 
jefferson heritage is subject to certain regulatory limitations with respect to the payment of dividends to the company 
at december   jefferson heritage had a total of approximately million available for the payment of additional dividends to the company under these regulations 
jefferson heritage met all existing regulatory capital requirements at december  jefferson heritage is required by federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid assets  consisting of cash and eligible investments  which include  among other investments  certain united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  certificates of deposit at insured banks  federal funds sold  and bankers acceptances 
the current level of liquidity required by the ots is of the sum of net withdrawable deposits and borrowings due within one year 
jefferson heritage has consistently maintained liquidity in excess of required amounts 
jefferson heritage s liquidity ratio was at december  jefferson savings and first federal s liquidity ratios were and  respectively  at december  the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from maturing investment securities and cash flows from operations 
borrowings consist primarily of advances and lines of credit from the federal home loan banks 
while scheduled amortization of loans securities and mortgage backed securities and maturities of investment securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company chooses among these different sources of funds based on comparative costs  availability  and the company s asset liability objectives 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which are short term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and include interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold 
at december    and  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million  and million respectively 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  and investing activities during any given period 
these activities for the years ended december    and are summarized below year ended december  in thousands operating activities net income    adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year    cash and cash equivalents at end of year    the company s operating activities continued to provide strong cash flows during although the primary source of cash continued to be net income  a greater portion of operating cash flows were attributable to non cash adjustments for items such as depreciation and amortization expense which increased by approximately million from to the primary investing activity of the company is the origination and or purchase of mortgage loans 
the company also purchases investment and mortgage backed securities to supplement loan production 
as the result of increased loan purchases  investing activities were a significant user of cash during rather than being a provider of cash as they were in and during the years ended december    and  the company originated loans in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
purchases of mortgage loans totaled million  million  and million  respectively  in those same periods 
purchases of investment and mortgage backed securities totaled million  million  and million  respectively  in those same periods 
these activities were funded in part by principal payments on loans and mortgage backed securities and maturities of investment securities totaling million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
during and  the company funded a substantial portion of its operations with cash flows from its investing activities  principally in the form of proceeds from sales and principal repayments on mortgage backed securities 
due to the increased volume of its loan purchases  however  the company had to fund a significant portion of its investing activities from financing activities in the primary financing activity of the company is the attraction of savings deposits supplemented by borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
savings deposits decreased million during the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  savings deposits increased million  and million  respectively 
the increase in includes deposits assumed in the acquisition of l b financial in the amount of million 
the increase in includes deposits assumed in the acquisition of texas heritage in the amount of million 
borrowed money increased million during the year ended december  by contrast  borrowed money decreased million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s higher level of borrowings during turned its financing activities into a provider of cash flows in rather than a user of cash as they had been in and the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments 
at december  the company had commitments to originate loans of million  and to purchase residential adjustable rate mortgages of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million 
management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the company 
year readiness disclosure the company is subject to risks associated with the year issue  a term which refers to uncertainties about the ability of various date processing hardware and software systems to interpret dates correctly after the beginning of the year the company began working on its year plan in and formed a project committee committee that reports monthly to the board of directors 
the committee has formulated a comprehensive year plan plan which follows guidelines outlined by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
the ffiec requires all banks to develop a plan that includes five phases relating to awareness  assessment  renovation  validations and implementation 
the plan establishes a timetable and summarizes each major phase of the project and the estimated costs to renovate and test systems in preparation for the year the awareness phase included a company wide campaign to communicate the problem and the potential ramifications to the organization 
concurrent with this phase  the committee began the assessment phase  which included the inventorying of systems that may be impacted 
the business use of each inventoried item was then analyzed and prioritized in varying degrees from critical to non critical  based upon the perceived adverse effect on the financial condition of the company in the event of a loss or interruption in the use of each system 
the renovation  validation and implementation phases consist of testing the individual systems and replacing or reconfiguring systems that are not year compliant 
the company has completed the awareness and assessment phases of the project 
the company has identified its most critically important system as its on line account processing system which the company maintains on its own mainframe computer using third party vendor application software 
the company has extensively tested the ability of the mainframe computer to handle the year date change under a variety of circumstances and believes that its mainframe hardware and software  as currently configured  will not be adversely affected by the year problem 
the company has identified various other less critical internal data processing and software systems that could potentially be affected by the year problem 
these consist primarily of desk top personal computers and the word processing and other software used on them 
these systems have been tested and have either been found to be year ready or replaced with systems that are year ready 
in the normal course of business  the company continually upgrades its computer systems and software 
these upgrades are tested as they are installed 
to date  the primary expense involved in the implementation of the company s year plan has been management and staff time which the company estimates to have been approximately  hours through the end of to the extent that any modifications to third party vendor software have been required  these modifications have been made by the vendors without any direct additional cost to the company 
the costs of equipment upgrades have either not been material or involved equipment that had already reached the end of its useful life and was due for replacement in any event 
as part of its year plan  the company has been identifying and assessing the year risks posed by third parties including customers and other entities whose operations may affect the company s business 
in this regard  the company has been working to increase the year awareness of its loan customers through mailings and other communications 
the company has surveyed its larger commercial loan customers as to their year readiness and considers year exposure in underwriting commercial loans 
the majority of the company s loan customers  however  are either individuals or small businesses which are not dependent on information technology in their day to day operations and are therefore not considered to pose a direct year risk 
although the company s loan customers may be collaterally affected by the year problems of others such as the failure of their employers to make timely salary payments  the company believes that its portfolio is sufficiently diversified that such failures will not have a material impact on operations 
in its day to day operations  the company also deals with a number of other third parties whose year readiness may affect the company s operations 
these third parties include the fnma and fhlmc to which it sells mortgage loans  various mortgage banks from which it purchases mortgage loans  credit bureaus  the fhlbs and a variety of other third parties 
pursuant to its year plan  the company has corresponded with each of these entities and received assurances as to their year readiness 
when feasible  the company has participated in testing of all automated links to these entities 
on the basis of these inquires and testing  the company does not believe that year issues related to these entities will have a material impact on the company operations 
the plan also includes provisions which address the year compliance of environmental systems  which include items such as security systems and heating and air conditioning systems 
no significant business risks have been revealed regarding these types of systems 
additional investigating is scheduled for first quarter concurrent with the development and execution of the plan is the evolution of the company s year contingent plan contingency plan 
the contingency plan addresses a wide variety of issues including failure of a system during year testing  failure of electrical  telecommunications  or water systems  failure of a system during the century date change and liquidity plan 
special consideration has been given to the weekend of the century date change 
the contingency plan is intended to be a changing document based on the ongoing results of the project and is updated on a regular basis 
the risks associated with the year issue can be grouped into two categories 
the first is the risk that one or more of the company s internal systems will be adversely affected by the century date change 
on the basis of its testing and preparation  the company believes that the risk of a failure in a critical system is low 
accordingly  the company believes that its primary internal risk is a failure in a less critical environment that will not materially disrupt operations 
the second risk category consists of external risks which are largely outside of the company s control 
the company would be most seriously affected if year failures of others caused basic services such as electrical power  telecommunications or government agencies to be disrupted 
although the preparation of such providers has been reviewed  there can be no assurance that year failures of third parties will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards reporting comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued sfas which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenue  expenses  gains  and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
the company adopted sfas on january  and displays comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in june  the fasb issued sfas which establishes standards for the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim reports issued to shareholders 
sfas is a disclosure requirement only and there is no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  see footnote for segment information 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fasb issued sfas which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivative and hedging activities 
the company has not yet determined the financial impact to its financial condition or results of operations but plans to adopt sfas on january  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk reference is made to the discussion captioned interest rate risk sensitivity in item of this annual report on form k
