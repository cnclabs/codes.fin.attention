results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in com s consolidated statements of income years ended may  may  may  sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative non recurring charges purchased in process technology merger related charges credits and other total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision equity interest in loss of consolidated joint venture net income excluding non recurring charges total operating expenses operating income net income comparison of fiscal years ended may  and may  sales fiscal sales totaled billion  an increase of six percent from fiscal sales of billion 
network systems 
sales of network systems products eg  switches  hubs  remote access concentrators  routers and customer service and support in fiscal were billion  an increase of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
the increase in network systems products sales when compared to fiscal was primarily due to growth in workgroup switching product sales  customer service sales  and the introduction of our corebuilder enterprise switch  partially offset by a decrease in certain other enterprise systems products 
sales of network systems products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal personal connectivity 
sales of personal connectivity products eg  desktop network interface cards nics  desktop modems  and personal computers pc cards for mobile computers in fiscal were billion  a decrease of eight percent from fiscal sales of billion 
the decline in personal connectivity sales when compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower sales of desktop analog modems 
sales of personal connectivity products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal handheld computing 
sales of handheld computing products in fiscal were million  an increase of percent when compared to fiscal sales of million 
the increase in handheld computing sales when compared to fiscal was due to increased market acceptance of our products and expansion of the market for handheld computing 
sales of handheld computing products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to five percent of total sales in fiscal com s sales in fiscal were primarily impacted by the transformation of our business mix 
historically  a significant portion of our sales has been derived from desktop nics  analog modems  and stackable hubs  which have entered the mature phase of their product life cycles 
sales in these product markets are flat to declining  because these products are particularly sensitive to price competition  are beginning to be replaced by newer technologies  and are increasingly being distributed through the pc original equipment manufacturer oem channel which carries lower average selling prices 
further  our sales of nics and modems are highly correlated with sales in the pc market 
while the overall pc market continues to grow  sales of low end pcs are growing faster than high end pcs 
lower priced pcs are not typically sold with high performance nics and modems such as those offered by com 
com s aggregate sales increased on a year over year basis primarily because of growth in handheld computing and workgroup switching 
us sales represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and increased four percent when compared to fiscal international sales in fiscal increased nine percent when compared to fiscal historically  the asia pacific and latin american regions have been high growth regions for the networking industry and com 
we believe that fiscal sales were impacted by the economic turmoil that occurred in these markets 
fiscal sales in the asia pacific region increased by only one percent when compared to fiscal in addition  sales in the latin american region decreased by percent when compared to fiscal gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the year over year gross margin improvement came from virtually all product lines and was primarily the result of product cost reductions  increased mix of certain higher margin network systems products  improved inventory management and improved manufacturing capacity utilization 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were billion  or percent of sales  compared to billion  or percent of sales in fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million and a credit of million for merger related and other primarily associated with the us robotics merger  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million and a charge of million for merger related and other primarily associated with the us robotics merger  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal the decline as a percentage of sales was primarily due to cost reductions as a result of post merger consolidation activities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million or two percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars is attributable to increased spending on handheld computing products and customer service programs  consistent with sales growth in those areas 
these expense increases were partially offset by decreased spending related to mature product lines such as analog modems 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million or nine percent compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the cost of developing new products and enhancements in the areas of switching  handheld computing  voice over the internet protocol voip and lan telephony voip  wireless access  broadband access primarily cable and digital subscriber line dsl and nics 
we believe the timely introduction of new technologies and products is crucial to our success  and we plan to continue to make acquisitions or strategic investments to accelerate time to market where appropriate 
com has continued to develop technologies that were in process at nbx  ics  smartcode and euphonics as of the dates of the acquisitions 
the costs for the projects in process are primarily labor costs for design  prototype development and testing 
as of may   we estimate that approximately million dollars will be expensed over the next months in connection with completion of such acquired research and development projects 
we anticipate future research and development spending  including costs remaining for the completion of these purchased in process research and development projects  will not significantly differ from the historical trend of research and development expenses as a percent of sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million or four percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars is primarily due to the elimination of duplicate infrastructure from the us robotics merger  partially offset by an increase in the provision for bad debts  primarily related to receivables in certain international regions 
purchased in process technology 
during fiscal  com recorded a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million associated with the acquisitions of smartcode  nbx  and certain assets of ics 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
merger related charges credits and other 
during fiscal  com recorded net pre tax merger related and other credits of approximately million 
this net amount reflects adjustments to previously recorded merger and restructuring charges  which totaled a net pre tax credit of approximately million  a million charge reflecting a change in the estimated net realizable value of closed manufacturing plants in chicago  and a million net gain on the sale of land in california 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher interest income due to higher average cash and investment balances  improved foreign currency results  and reduced interest expense 
interest and other income  net for fiscal included foreign currency losses of approximately million  primarily related to korean operations  where foreign exchange hedges were not available  or were available only to a limited extent 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to an early call premium and write off of unamortized issuance fees associated with the redemption of convertible notes 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
where available  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge significant balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
income tax provision com s effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the tax rate in fiscal reflected certain merger related and other costs associated with the merger with us robotics that were not deductible 
excluding the non deductible portion of merger related and other charges primarily associated with the merger with us robotics  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal the decrease in tax rate from to was primarily due to the increase in offshore manufacturing in countries with tax rates significantly below the us statutory rate 
equity interest in loss of consolidated joint venture equity interest in loss of consolidated joint venture was million for fiscal this amount represents the pro rata share of the joint venture s loss allocated to the other investors for the period between the date of investment and the end of our fiscal year 
com entered into this joint venture in the third quarter of fiscal see notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income and net income per share net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for fiscal excluding the purchased in process technology  net pre tax merger related charges credits  and other  net income was million  or per share for fiscal excluding the net pre tax charge for purchased in process technology and merger related charges credits and other  net income was million  or per share for fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended may  and sales fiscal sales totaled billion  a decline of three percent from fiscal sales of billion 
network systems 
sales of network systems products in fiscal were billion  an increase of one percent from fiscal sales of billion 
sales of network systems products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal personal connectivity 
sales of personal connectivity products in fiscal were billion  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
sales of personal connectivity products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal handheld computing 
sales of handheld computing products in fiscal were million  an increase of percent from fiscal sales of million 
sales of handheld computing products represented five percent of total sales in fiscal compared to two percent of total sales in fiscal geographic 
sales in the us represented percent of total sales in fiscal and fiscal com experienced a decline from fiscal in domestic and international sales of four and two percent  respectively 
com believes that sales in fiscal year were affected by the following factors industry growth rates 
networking industry growth rates have slowed since the beginning of calendar while the industry had grown at rates in excess of percent in prior years  market research reports indicate that the networking industry worldwide grew by less than percent during  and this pattern continued into channel inventory 
in the second quarter of fiscal  com adopted a new inventory business model  which generally calls for fewer weeks supply of inventory in the distribution channel 
we transitioned to this model during the second and third quarters of fiscal as a result  sales during these periods were adversely affected 
modems 
fiscal sales of modem products decreased compared to fiscal in january  the international telecommunications union itu determined the v 
standard for kilobits per second kbps technology 
com believes that the previous lack of such a standard contributed to delays in customers purchasing decisions for higher speed modems and remote access concentrators 
although we began shipping v 
standard modems late in the third quarter of fiscal  we believe these delays  as well as product transitions  adversely affected sales 
in addition  the delay in the v 
standard caused aggressive pricing in older generation modem products  which in connection with the channel inventory reduction mentioned above  contributed to a year over year decrease in sales 
pricing 
the pricing environment was very competitive  and although com experienced significant year over year unit growth in key products such as fast ethernet nics and workgroup switches  these gains were partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
for example  in fiscal  we experienced price decreases between and percent compared to fiscal in a number of product segments  including modems  workgroup switches  hubs and remote access concentrators 
remote access concentrators 
fiscal sales of remote access concentrators decreased compared to fiscal factors affecting this decrease included aggressive price competition  including the introduction of new higher density products at prices similar to the older lower density products 
in addition  sales of remote access concentrators were impacted by the channel inventory reduction described above 
asia pacific economic turmoil 
during fiscal  sales in the asia pacific region increased only four percent compared to fiscal sales growth was percent in fiscal compared to fiscal historically  the asia pacific region had been a high growth region for the networking industry and com 
during fiscal  however  several asian countries experienced a weakening of their local currencies and turmoil in their financial markets and institutions  which we believe adversely affected financial results during fiscal handheld computing and switching products 
fiscal sales of handheld computing products more than doubled compared to fiscal and achieved growth in market share  according to industry reports 
growth rates and market share gains in the handheld computing market may not be sustainable in the face of increasing competition from new entrants to the market 
in addition  our workgroup switching products experienced significant unit volume growth and increased sales  despite significant declines in average selling prices and the effect of the channel inventory reduction  as described in the above paragraphs 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal in addition to the factors mentioned above  com s year over year gross margin decline was affected by several factors  including product mix  increased price competition  and higher period costs 
com s product mix included higher sales of certain nics and workgroup switching products  as well as an increase in sales to oems  which carry lower gross margins 
the us robotics brand modems with x technology were introduced in the third quarter of fiscal with significantly higher margins  reflecting first to market pricing 
during fiscal  increased product and price competition in this product segment resulted in a decline in gross margin percent 
additionally  com experienced aggressive pricing on remote access products  as described above  which resulted in a decline in gross margin percent 
fixed manufacturing costs and period costs were a higher percentage of sales  primarily as a result of the decrease in sales in the second and third quarters of fiscal  but also due to excess manufacturing capacity 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were billion  or percent of sales  compared to billion  or percent of sales in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of sales were higher than historical levels  in part due to the reduced level of sales in fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million and merger related and other charges of million primarily associated with the us robotics merger  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million associated with the acquisition of scorpio and a merger related charge of million associated with the acquisition of onstream  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million or percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase is attributable to the expansion of field sales and marketing activities worldwide  primarily internationally  and increased spending for com s customer service programs 
in addition  spending on com s global branding campaign during fiscal contributed to increased marketing expenses compared to the prior year 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million or percent compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars and dollars as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the cost of developing com s new products in the areas of personal connectivity and switching  and its expansion into new technologies and markets  such as dsl 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million or seven percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent of sales  compared to percent in fiscal the year over year increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and dollars as a percentage of sales is attributable to the expansion of com s infrastructure  including personnel  as well as an increase in the provision for bad debts 
purchased in process technology 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  com recorded a charge of approximately million for purchased in process technology associated with the lanworks acquisition 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
merger related charges credits and other 
during fiscal  we recorded merger related and other charges of million 
these charges consisted of a merger related charge and other charges associated with past merger activities and disposition of real estate 
the merger related charge of approximately million related to the merger with us robotics 
during the fourth quarter  we reversed approximately million of previously recorded merger accruals 
com also sold a parcel of land near its headquarters site in santa clara  which resulted in a net gain of approximately million 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made a decision to close a manufacturing site in illinois in order to consolidate two chicago area manufacturing facilities into one location 
we recognized a charge of approximately million associated with this closure 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher interest income due to higher average cash balances 
interest and other income  net for fiscal included a charge of approximately million related to an early call premium and write off of unamortized issuance fees associated with the redemption of million of convertible notes in december the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
where available  com enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
fiscal interest and other income  net included foreign currency losses of approximately million  primarily related to korean operations  where foreign exchange hedges were not available  or were available only to a limited extent 
income tax provision com s effective income tax rate was approximately percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal excluding the non deductible portion of merger related and other charges primarily associated with the merger with us robotics  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal excluding a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million and tax benefit of approximately million associated with the acquisition of scorpio and the non deductible portion of the merger related charge associated with the merger with onstream  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal net income and net income per share net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share for fiscal excluding a charge for purchased in process technology and merger related and other charges mentioned above  net income would have been million  or per share for fiscal excluding the purchased in process technology and tax benefit  and the merger related charge  net income would have been million  or per share for fiscal business environment and industry trends com s future results may be affected by industry trends and specific risks in our business 
some of the factors that could cause future results to materially differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements include those discussed below 
slower growth in our industry our financial success is dependent on the overall growth rate of the networking industry 
in and  the networking industry grew more slowly than in the past 
industry reports indicate that the segments of the industry in which we participate grew in aggregate by less than percent during and in aggregate by less than percent during independent market analysis indicates that industry growth rates in our markets may continue to decline in calendar  both because the industry is maturing and because many companies may delay equipment purchases through at least the end of the calendar year due to costs associated with year date conversion 
the growth of related industries such as the pc market also affects com s growth 
recent industry reports indicate that the pc market grew by percent in and is projected to grow by percent in much of the growth in this sector is occurring in the low end of the market 
these inexpensive pcs typically do not include high performance nics and modems such as those offered by com 
our business  operating results or financial condition may be adversely affected by any decreases in growth rates of networking or pc markets 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our results in any particular period will be consistent with the future growth rate of the industry 
consolidation in our industry there have been many mergers and acquisitions in the networking industry in the past several years 
more recently  there have also been mergers between telecommunications equipment providers and networking companies  as well as between networking companies and computer component suppliers 
examples from january through june include com acquired lanworks  euphonics  smartcode  nbx and certain assets of ics and entered into a joint venture with a taiwanese networking company  lucent technologies  a telecommunications company  acquired companies  including networking equipment supplier ascend communications  cisco systems  a networking equipment supplier  acquired companies  nortel networks  a telecommunications company  acquired five companies  including bay networks  a networking equipment supplier  alcatel  a telecommunications company  acquired five companies  including xylan  a networking equipment supplier  siemens ag  a telecommunications company  announced plans to acquire three networking firms  general electric company  an engineering firm  acquired fore  a networking equipment supplier  intel corporation  a computer components manufacturer  acquired a data networking company and a manufacturer of telecommunications computer components 
future business combinations in the networking industry may result in companies with greater resources and stronger competitive positions and products than com 
continued industry consolidation may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
managing strategic relationships in addition to mergers and acquisitions  technology companies are continually entering into strategic relationships 
for example  during fiscal  we announced or expanded strategic relationships with several companies including the following microsoft corporation siemens ag dell computer ibm hewlett packard sun microsystems motorola symbol our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we experience difficulties managing relationships with our partners or if projects with partners are unsuccessful 
in addition  if our competitors enter into successful strategic relationships  they could increase the competition that we face 
increased competition in our distribution channels we distribute many of our products through indirect distribution channels that include distributors  systems integrators  value added resellers  and retailers 
we believe these indirect distribution channels are experiencing heightened competition from internet based suppliers and pc manufacturers that distribute directly to end user customers 
these changes in the pattern of distribution of networking products could have a material adverse affect on our sales and financial results 
further  com is building in house capabilities to sell directly to end user customers over the internet e business 
if this initiative is successful  it could cause conflict with our current indirect channels of distribution 
if we are unsuccessful in selling through our e business channel  we could lose market share to competitors who have more successfully developed these capabilities 
either of these outcomes could have a material adverse affect on our operating results or financial condition 
shift to pc oem distribution pc related networking products such as modems and nics are increasingly being sold through the pc oem channel rather than the distribution channel 
we derive a significant portion of our personal connectivity product sales from pc oems such as dell computer  toshiba  gateway  hewlett packard and ibm  who incorporate our nics  analog modems  or chipsets into their products 
while sales to pc oems are important  products sold through the pc oem channel typically have a lower average selling price than those sold through other channels 
therefore  our sales and margins may be adversely impacted if sales to pc oems continue to become a larger percentage of our business 
in addition  pc oems sometimes choose to integrate nic and modem functions onto the pc motherboard 
for example  we currently sell networking chipsets to dell computer that are integrated directly onto the pc motherboard of dell s high end optiplex line of pcs 
competitors who can integrate networking and other computer processing functions onto a single chip might offer pc oems a cheaper alternative to our solutions 
if the integration of networking and computer processing functionality on a reduced number of components increases  our future sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
competition and pricing pressure may affect our business we participate in a highly volatile industry characterized by vigorous competition for market share as well as rapid product and technology development and maturation 
as products mature and become less differentiated from competitive offerings  product prices decline 
in addition  both com and our competitors sometimes lower product prices in order to gain market share or create more demand for our products 
intense pricing competition in our industry may adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
for example  the rapid decline in prices for analog modems and network interface cards caused our sales to these markets to decline in fiscal  and continued price declines will likely result in a further decrease in our sales to these markets 
our competition historically has come from start up companies  well capitalized computer systems and communications companies  and other technology companies focusing on data networking 
however  our industry is changing  resulting in new and other potential competitors who have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than com 
for example  technology innovations are driving the convergence of voice  video and data traffic onto a single network infrastructure  and we now compete with much larger telecommunications equipment companies such as lucent technologies inc and nortel networks 
we are also selling products into new markets where we compete with different companies than in the past 
for example  our palm computing products compete with product offerings from consumer electronics companies such as sharp  casio and phillips and could compete with other companies who license the palm operating system from us 
competitors may develop products and technologies that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive  which could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we expect significant technology transitions to take place in the networking industry 
although these changes will create long term business potential for us  it is possible that they may also create a disruptive effect on short term buying patterns by our customers and could potentially change the competitive landscape in which com has operated historically 
uncertainties of international markets we operate internationally and expect that international markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales 
some international markets are characterized by economic and political instability and currency fluctuations that can adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
for example  during fiscal  com had lower sales in the latin american region and only slightly increased sales in the asia pacific region compared to fiscal the instability in the latin american and asia pacific financial markets negatively affected our sales in those markets by  among other things  decreasing end user purchases  increasing competition from local competitors  and reducing access to sources of capital needed by customers to make purchases 
in addition to reducing sales  difficulties in the latin american and asia pacific regions subject our resellers to financial hardships  which may increase our credit risk if our customers become insolvent or their ability to meet obligations is otherwise impaired 
proposed changes in accounting for business combinations the financial accounting standards board fasb began deliberation of revisions to the rules for business combinations in some of these deliberations have included accounting rule making bodies from other nations as the financial communities attempt to develop global consistency where possible 
business combination rules govern the accounting for mergers and acquisitions used in either a purchase or a pooling of interests combination 
tentative conclusions of the fasb severely restrict the use of pooling of interests and prohibit the immediate write off of purchased in process technology 
the fasb expects to reach a conclusion on some of the business combination revisions in calendar changes to the current accounting rules for business combinations will not preclude mergers or acquisitions but may increase the earnings dilution associated with future transactions 
in addition  if pooling of interests accounting is no longer available  we may use cash more often than our common stock to pay for acquisitions of other companies 
during this period of deliberation and rule change  the securities and exchange commission has heightened its review of transactions intended to qualify for pooling of interests accounting  transactions in which a large percentage of the purchase price is associated with purchased in process technology  and restructuring and impairment charges recorded at the time of a business combination 
if the commission issues new guidance or interpretation of existing rules  we may be required to restate previously filed consolidated financial statements and our future results may be adversely impacted 
company specific trends and risks our sales base is transitioning to include additional high growth businesses we participate in many markets that are growing at varying rates 
historically  a significant portion of our sales has been derived from desktop nics  analog modems  and stackable hubs  which have entered the mature phase of their product life cycles 
sales in these product markets are flat to declining  partially because these products are particularly sensitive to price competition or are beginning to be replaced by newer technologies 
consequently  we believe that sales derived from these products will decline as a percent of our total sales 
other moderate growth markets where we participate include lan switching  remote access concentrators and wan access 
we expect these segments will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
in addition  we are increasing our investments in several high growth and emerging markets that are forecasted to grow significantly higher than the networking industry average 
we expect these businesses to account for a higher percentage of our sales 
in particular  we are focused on the following high growth and emerging markets handheld computing ip and lan telephony voip and lan telephony broadband access primarily cable and dsl wireless access home networking the transition of our sales base to these new markets may cause disruption in our sales  research and development efforts  and manufacturing operations 
we cannot be certain that these emerging markets will materialize in the timeframes that we expect  that we will introduce products for these markets in a timely manner  that the market will accept these products  or that we will successfully generate significant sales and profitability from these markets 
in addition  sales from our mature product lines may decline more rapidly than growth in emerging product lines  and therefore  our results could be materially impacted 
due to the transition of our sales base  sales in the first half of fiscal year will likely be lower than sales in the first half of fiscal our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products products in the networking industry have short life cycles 
therefore  our success depends on our ability to identify new market and product opportunities  to timely develop and introduce new products  and to gain market acceptance of new products  particularly in the emerging markets described above 
for example  the introduction of the palm vii handheld computing product creates risks involving our ability to successfully support the palm 
net service on a large scale and price the service at a level that produces expected returns 
industry standards and regulations may affect our success our success also depends on the timely adoption of industry standards  resolution of conflicting us and international standards requirements created by the convergence of technology such as voice onto data networks  the timely introduction of new standards compliant products  and a favorable regulatory environment 
slow market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
for example  the wireless access protocol wap used by companies such as nokia  motorola  ericsson  symbian  and phone 
com competes with our web clipping protocol 
if the wap protocol becomes the industry standard  this could affect our sales of products which incorporate the web clipping protocol  such as the palm vii  which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  if we fail to achieve timely certification of compliance to industry standards for our products  our sales of such products and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  a number of new product initiatives  particularly in the area of ip telephony voip  could be impacted by new or revised regulations  which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we rely on distributors  resellers and pc oems we sell a significant portion of our products to distributors  resellers and pc oems 
because we rely on these channels  we are subject to many risks  including inventory  credit and business concentration 
in particular  our distributors and resellers maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories 
we attempt to ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to end users by working closely with distributors and resellers to monitor inventory levels 
if channel partners attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand  our sales could be negatively impacted 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales are made through a limited number of distributors and resellers 
as a result  we experience a concentration of credit risk 
while we monitor and attempt to manage this risk  financial difficulties on the part of one or more of our distributors or resellers may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
a significant portion of our sales are to a few customers ingram micro inc and tech data corporation collectively accounted for percent of our total sales in fiscal  and ingram micro inc accounted for percent of our total sales in fiscal we cannot be certain that these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels 
further  certain customers represent a large portion of sales in particular product lines 
we typically do not enter into contracts with our customers that require them to purchase minimum quantities of our products  and our customers have some rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
our results of operations  financial condition  or market share could be adversely affected if we lost one or more of our major customers  if these customers reduced  delayed or canceled their orders  or if we did not timely ship our products to these customers 
we may fail to perform within our financial model in managing our business  we periodically establish and revise a long term financial model ltfm based on observed and anticipated trends in technology and the marketplace 
the model  which includes ranges for gross margin  operating expenses and operating income  is not intended to be a prediction of future financial results 
instead  our management uses it in making decisions about the allocation of resources and investments 
the current model  which was established in the second quarter of fiscal  is as follows gross margin operating expenses operating income for the last three quarters of fiscal  we have operated within the targeted ltfm for gross margins 
our operating expenses are well above our ltfm range 
while we expect to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales  we will continue to invest in emerging markets that offer long term growth 
therefore  we do not expect to reach the ltfm operating expense or operating income ranges in fiscal our quarterly results may fluctuate our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly 
a wide variety of factors can cause these fluctuations  including seasonality with respect to the volume and timing of orders the introduction and acceptance of new products and technologies price competition general conditions and trends in the networking industry and technology sector disruption in international markets general economic conditions industry consolidation  acquisitions  or litigation disruption in the distribution channel timing of orders received within the quarter 
our first and third fiscal quarters have historically been seasonally weaker periods characterized by sequentially lower sales or only slightly increased sales from the prior quarters 
we expect this pattern to continue in fiscal these factors  and accompanying fluctuations in periodic operating results  could have a significant adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
our operating results depend on our ability to satisfy product orders the timing and amount of our sales depend on a number of factors that make estimating operating results prior to the end of any period uncertain 
for example  we do not typically maintain a significant backlog 
consequently  product sales in any quarter depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
in addition  our customers historically request fulfillment of orders in a short period of time  resulting in limited visibility to sales trends 
as a result  our operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders and our ability to fulfill the orders in a timely manner 
in each quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately half of our sales in the last five weeks of the quarter 
non linear sales patterns make business planning difficult  and increase the risk that our quarterly results will fluctuate due to disruptions in functions such as manufacturing  order management  information systems and shipping 
our products must satisfy warranties and international requirements because our products are often covered by legal and contractual warranties  we may be subject to contractual and or legal commitments to perform under such warranties 
if our products fail to perform as warranted and we do not resolve product quality or performance issues in a timely manner  our operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
likewise  if we fail to meet commitments related to installation of enterprise networks  we could be subject to claims for business disruption or consequential damages if a network implementation is not successfully or timely completed 
in addition  because our products are sold and marketed in many countries  our products must function in and meet the requirements of many different telecommunications environments and be compatible with various telecommunications systems and products 
if our products fail to meet the requirements of international telecommunication environments  our sales could be negatively impacted 
our business is affected by our ability to manage our supply chain some key components of our products are currently available only from single or limited sources 
likewise  some services on which we rely are furnished from single or limited service providers 
in addition  some of our suppliers are also our competitors 
while we generally have been able to obtain adequate supplies of components from existing sources  we cannot be certain that in the future our suppliers will be able to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
our business  operating results  financial condition or customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  key components  or a similar disruption in the availability of key services 
we are working to significantly reduce our supply chain cycle time  from ordering raw materials  to manufacturing products and delivering the products to customers 
should these changes temporarily disrupt our ability to ship product to our customers  our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted 
commercial commitments we sometimes enter into minimum quantity or other non cancelable commitments 
if sales volumes fluctuate significantly  our obligation to meet commitments could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
intellectual property rights many of our competitors  such as telecommunications and computer equipment manufacturers  have large intellectual property portfolios  including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business 
in addition  many smaller companies  universities and individual inventors have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business 
the industry is moving towards aggressive assertion  licensing and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies  protocols or specifications in our products 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses  on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture  sale and use of our products  particularly those which must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our intellectual property rights 
whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
further  plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  the existence of or any adverse determinations in this litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
in addition  if we are the alleged infringer  we could be required to seek licenses from others or be prevented from manufacturing or selling our products  which could cause disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete 
if we are asserting our intellectual property rights  we could be prevented from stopping others from manufacturing or selling competitive products 
any one of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
competition for key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees and management 
during the last quarter of fiscal  the rate of employee turnover increased 
the loss of the services of key employees could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  including engineers  is highly competitive 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain skilled personnel  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
in addition  we must carefully balance the growth of our employees commensurate with our anticipated sales growth 
if our sales growth or attrition levels vary significantly  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  com s common stock price has been  and may continue to be extremely volatile 
when the com common stock price is less than the exercise price of stock options granted to employees  turnover is likely to increase  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
year readiness disclosure as is true for most companies  com faces a risk from the year issue 
com s operations could be adversely affected if systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to the year issue affects us at the end of the calendar year com faces risk primarily in the following areas systems used by com to run our business including information systems  equipment and facilities systems used by com s suppliers potential warranty or other claims from com customers potential for reduced spending by other companies on networking solutions as a result of significant information systems spending on year remediation com continues to evaluate and mitigate our exposure in these areas where appropriate 
we intend for some of our disclosures and announcements concerning our products and year programs  including those in this report on form k  to constitute year readiness disclosures as defined in the recently enacted year information and readiness disclosure act 
we cannot be certain that year issues will not have a material adverse impact on us 
state of readiness and risks 
com has identified four key exposure areas within com with respect to the year issue  namely key transaction processing applications  equipment and facilities  com products  and key suppliers 
key transaction processing applications 
key transaction processing applications include those used to run com s business  such as finance  manufacturing  order processing and distribution 
we have completed our evaluation of these applications for year readiness and have been fixing or replacing systems  where necessary 
as of the end of fiscal  we successfully completed our fiscal year rollover 
we expect to complete integration testing and be ready for the calendar year rollover by the end of september if we are delayed in implementing replacement systems  if we identify significant new non compliance issues  or if we encounter unexpected difficulties in areas previously considered to be year ready  our ability to conduct our business or record transactions could be disrupted  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
equipment and facilities 
com is evaluating year readiness of its equipment and facilities 
we are in the final stages of contacting our key suppliers to ascertain year compliance of our critical equipment 
we expect our critical equipment to be ready for year by the end of september if we are delayed in identifying non compliant equipment and upgrading or replacing the equipment  our design  production and shipping capabilities could be disrupted  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
com is also evaluating each of our pcs worldwide  assessing its year readiness  and upgrading as required 
because not all of our pcs can be upgraded  some will need to be replaced 
we currently expect to need to replace less than of the pcs deployed worldwide and have included the cost of the replacements in our total year cost estimates 
we expect to complete the upgrade or replacement of pcs by the end of the calendar year 
com is also assessing the year readiness of our owned and leased facilities worldwide 
we are giving priority to critical facilities that house large numbers of employees or significant operations 
we have made significant progress in our assessment activities and expect to be completed by the end of august we expect to complete remediation efforts by the end of september it is critical to our operations that these facilities function  and any delays in achieving year compliance with respect to these facilities could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
products 
com has conducted an extensive evaluation of our currently available and installed base of products 
we believe that the products on our current price list are year ready 
we have identified some obsolete products that are not year ready 
while we still support some of these obsolete products  all can be upgraded or replaced with a com year ready product 
we cannot be certain that older releases of our products will be year ready with customers systems or within existing networks 
to assist our customers in evaluating the year readiness of com s products  we have developed a list that indicates the capability of our products 
we have published the list on our website www 
com 
com and we periodically update it as we complete our assessment of additional products 
if any of our products do not operate properly in the year  we could have increased warranty costs  customer satisfaction issues  litigation or other material costs and liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
key suppliers 
com has contacted its critical suppliers of products and services to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year ready 
confirmation of the continued year readiness of these key suppliers will continue throughout the remainder of if key suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products or services they provide to com  critical materials  products and services may not be delivered in a timely manner  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
we believe that our most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would relate to problems with the systems and services of third parties rather than with com s internal systems or products 
we believe the risks are greatest with infrastructure eg  electricity supply and water and sewer service  telecommunications  transportation and distribution channels and critical suppliers of materials and services 
com s operations are conducted in a variety of domestic and foreign facilities 
each location relies on local private and governmental suppliers for utilities  telephone  and other necessary services and supplies 
for example  failure in the electricity grid or disruption to the continuous supply of power would be a worst case scenario that would completely shut down the affected facilities 
widespread electrical failures could also adversely affect the delivery of water and sewer services  and hinder the transportation of employees to and from the workplace 
com cannot identify all possible disruption scenarios 
we are preparing contingency plans specifying our actions if failures occur in key internal systems and or critical third party systems and services 
the process includes identifying and prioritizing risks  assessing the business impact of those risks  evaluating risk mitigation alternatives  and preparing written contingency plans for those failures with the greatest business risk to com 
preliminary contingency plans for critical business operations are expected to be in place by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year in the second and third quarters it is expected that these plans will be validated and modified as needed 
contingency plans will continue to be refined through as we learn more about the preparations and potential exposure of third parties to year disruptions 
costs to address year issues 
we currently estimate that the total cost of these programs will range between approximately million and million including contingencies of approximately million to million related to the items noted below 
through may   we have spent million on the program 
all expected costs are based on our current evaluation of the year programs and may change as the program progresses 
the remainder of our projected year costs include hardware and software upgrades or replacements primarily related to desktop systems and telephone equipment  consultant and contractor fees to assist in assessments and to perform remediation and integration testing  increased staffing in our customer service area to address the expected increase in support calls during the year transition  a contingency for potential product upgrades or replacements  a contingency for potential disruption in supplier product or service delivery or in manufacturing operations  and a contingency for potential unexpected costs associated with replacing or repairing systems previously considered to be year ready 
we have not included in the total cost estimate any costs associated with potential year litigation exposure since these costs are not estimable 
we have adequate funds to pay for the expected costs of year programs 
as of the end of fiscal  we have not deferred any significant internal information technology projects due to our year efforts 
sales impact 
year readiness is an issue for virtually all businesses whose computer systems and applications may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications 
companies owning and operating such systems may plan to devote a substantial portion of their information systems spending to fund such upgrades and modifications and divert spending away from networking solutions 
in addition  companies may defer spending on networking solutions while they test and ensure the stability of their current network configurations 
such changes in customers spending patterns could adversely affect our sales  operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents and short term investments at may  were billion  an increase of million from billion at may  for the fiscal year ended may   net cash generated from operating activities was billion 
accounts receivable at may  increased million from may  to million 
days sales outstanding in receivables increased to days at may   compared to days at may  inventory levels at may  decreased million  of which million was finished goods  from the prior fiscal year end to million 
annualized inventory turnover was turns for the quarter ended may   compared to turns for the quarter ended may  during fiscal  com acquired three companies and certain assets of a fourth for a combined total of million in cash  net of cash acquired 
during the fiscal year ended may   com made million in capital expenditures 
major capital expenditures included upgrades and expansion of our facilities and purchases and upgrades of systems and equipment 
additionally  during fiscal  we sold three facilities in the chicago and boxborough areas and equipment in the chicago area for total net proceeds of million 
as of may   com had approximately million in capital expenditure commitments outstanding primarily associated with facilities renovation and information system projects 
in addition  we have commitments relating to lease arrangements in the us  under which we have an option to purchase the properties for an aggregate of million  or arrange for the sale of the properties to a third party 
if the properties are sold to a third party at less than the option price  com retains an obligation for a portion of the shortfall  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
during fiscal and june  com s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of million shares of com s common stock 
such purchases will be made in the open market from time to time 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of million 
during fiscal  we received net cash of million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans 
com has a million revolving bank credit agreement which expires december  payment of cash dividends is permitted under the credit agreement  subject to certain limitations based on our net income levels 
we have not paid and do not anticipate we will pay cash dividends on our common stock 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants 
as of may   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement  and we were in compliance with all required covenants 
during fiscal  com repaid million of borrowings under the unsecured senior notes agreement 
as of may   million of this debt remained outstanding  of which million is classified as current 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and the available credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june and june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
these statements require companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas will be effective for com s fiscal year ending may  we believe that adoption of these statements will not have a significant impact on our financial results 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop no 
requires that entities capitalize certain costs related to internal use software once certain criteria have been met 
sop will be effective for com s fiscal year ending june  we believe that adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about com s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
com maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at may  and may   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
at may  and may   we had approximately million and million of outstanding obligations under certain real estate lease arrangements with monthly payments tied to short term interest rates and lease residual guarantees 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased payments associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income or cash flows 
in addition  we also have a mixture of fixed and floating rate long term debt of approximately million as of may  and million as of may  a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of this debt 
com does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward and option contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  and may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of com s forward and option contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  and may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward and option contracts by million and million  respectively 
in either scenario  the gains or losses on the forward and option contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
com holds a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had a million impact on the value of these securities in fiscal equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have had a material impact on the value of these securities held in fiscal
