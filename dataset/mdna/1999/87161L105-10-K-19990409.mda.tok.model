revenues from the other major product lines decreased in including vocalpoint ivr which declined from million to million  or 
with the introduction of vista  the company s backlog at december  includes million of vista orders out of a total of million 
as the vista product line gains acceptance  the company will continue to experience a decline in sales and system revenues from its vocalpoint products 
service bureau revenues decreased  or  between the comparable years which includes the company s home ticket  a pay per view service for cable television providers which is offered through the company s sis subsidiary 
the cable tv industry has experienced a decline in the consumer purchases of pay per view events which resulted in lower than expected transaction processing fees by the company 
offsetting the decline in pay per view buy rates  the service bureau has offered other outsourced electronic capabilities including benefits enrollment  broadcast faxing  call center processing  audiotext  and dealer locators 
the company expects that these outsourced services of the business will continue to grow in maintenance and other service revenues increased million  or  between the comparable years 
the increase is primarily due to settlements of patent lawsuits for which the company retained economic rights after the sale of the patent portfolio in october patent revenues increased from million in to million in the company is still pursuing certain litigation against third parties but the timing and payments  if any  from potential settlements are uncertain after domestic and international sales for were million  or  and million  or  of total revenues  respectively  compared to million  or  and million  or of total revenues  respectively  for gross margin the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was of net revenues  as compared with for the year ended december  gross margins on system sales increased from to between years primarily due to the proportion of fixed costs in overhead relative to the decline in revenues and change in product mix caused by the introduction of the vista product line 
gross margins for the service bureau increased from to between years as a result of lower fixed costs  lower negotiated transport rates and an increase in revenues that did not have incremental transport costs

gross margins will fluctuate on a year to year basis due to changes in competitive pressures  sales volume  product mix  variations in the ratio of domestic versus international sales  or changes in the mix of direct and indirect sales activity 
accordingly  the gross margins reported for are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods

non core products  premier and premier ivr systems and the vocalpoint audio response unit aru  declined million  or  between comparable periods and the company expects these revenues to continue to decline over time as the company migrates its customer base to the core product offerings 
the decrease in system sales was related to two major factors 
first  in late  the company introduced its new product and marketing strategy around the interactive communications management icm solution set 
this strategy is designed to sell a more complex  fully integrated and higher value solution 
as the company began introducing this strategy  the average selling price of new customer orders began to increase 
this resulted in an elongation of the selling cycle as the company experienced more involvement from executive management and third party consultants in the prospective customer base 
second  the change in management of the company associated with the merger with pinnacle  combined with the change in the sales and marketing strategy  resulted in a significant turnover in the company s sales force beginning in early the company believes that there is a direct relationship between system sales volume and the number of sales representatives employed

gross margins for maintenance and other service revenues decreased from to between years 
the company includes those costs directly associated with the generation of revenue in its computation of gross margin  including direct labor  application development  travel  maintenance  customer support  supplies and hardware 
gross margins will fluctuate on a year to year basis due to changes in competitive pressures  sales volume  product mix  variations in the ratio of domestic versus international sales  or changes in the mix of direct and indirect sales activity

excluding this write down  operating expenses would have been million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to selling  marketing and administrative expenses decreased million  or  between years 
this decrease resulted primarily from the lowering of expenses which vary with revenues and profits and lower expenses associated with the reductions in personnel that were completed in as part of overall consolidation plans 
research and development expenses remained flat between years 
the company reallocated its development resources to the development of market driven features and upgrades for the company s core product lines and away from its non core products

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash investment portfolio 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and interest rate risk 
investments are placed in instruments with high credit quality issuers 
all liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents and investments with a maturity date between three and twelve months are classified as marketable securities see note 
the average interest rate on marketable securities is 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its cash investment portfolio since marketable securities have generally been held until maturity and unrealized gains and losses are negligible 
the company s only long term liabilities are capital lease obligations at a fixed rate 
therefore  the company does not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates as it relates to its current or long term liabilities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company invoices all international customers in u 
s 
dollars except customers of the company s united kingdom uk subsidiary which are invoiced in sterling 
the uk subsidiary s financials including balance sheet  revenue  and operating expenses are transacted in sterling 
therefore  the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of the uk subsidiary to uk dollars in consolidation 
at this time  the company does not use instruments to hedge its foreign exposure in the uk because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not material
