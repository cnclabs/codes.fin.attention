the company offers several licensing and service options for its software products 
customers can either purchase a perpetual software license or enter into a subscription license contract 
customers may also choose to use our hosting services for their perpetual software license or install the software on servers within their own internal environment 
subscription licenses are only available to customers who also use our hosting services 
perpetual license revenues and professional services are typically recognized as the software or service is delivered  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met and do not provide a contractual  predictable future revenue stream 
the recurring revenue opportunities come from subscriptions or maintenance and hosting services 
while the company may have better visibility of future revenue from subscription licenses  our customers make the final decision on the form of their software license 
the company encourages all of its customers to use its hosting services 
the company depends on several factors to increase revenue and maintain profitability adding new customers  maintaining its current base of subscription  hosting and maintenance revenues  and improving the gross margins of our professional services 
adding new customers is the primary responsibility of the sales department 
maintaining the other revenue streams is the responsibility of our professional services department 
the company has developed compensation structures for these departments that it believes provides appropriate incentives for achievement of their respective goals 
the company s revenue is principally derived from sales of perpetual licenses or subscriptions to its software 
the click commerce software suite consists of the partner portal platform and framework and workflow  reporting  opportunity management  product information management  sales order management  after sales service management and supply chain management applications

cost of service revenues include salaries and related expenses for professional services and technical support personnel who provide consulting and implementation services  maintenance and hosting services  as well as an allocation of data processing and direct overhead costs which are expensed as incurred 
operating expenses are classified into five general categories sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  amortization of stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive management  finance and administrative employees  legal and accounting services  and corporate liability insurance 
amortization of stock based compensation represents the amortization over the related service period of the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  as well as amortization of the warrant issued in connection with a joint marketing agreement with accenture ltd 
accenture 
since the company reached an agreement with accenture to cancel the warrant in the fourth quarter of  no amortization expense of the warrant is reflected in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income loss since that period or any subsequent period 
amortization of intangible assets represents amortization expense for certain intangible assets with finite useful lives  which were recorded in connection with the acquisition of allegis corporation during the first quarter of  the acquisition of webridge on april  and the acquisition of btrade on july  the intangible assets are identified  valued and classified into separate categories 
the categories are customer relationships  developed technologies  order backlog  trade names  and in process research and development 
the amortization of developed technologies is recorded in the cost of product license line item on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
in april  the company issued a warrant to accenture to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant vested contingently upon the achievement of certain milestones  primarily the generation of license revenue for the company  and was set to expire on april  the warrant contained a significant cash penalty for accenture s failure to meet the agreed revenue target by the expiration date  and  accordingly  the fair value of the warrant was determined on the date of grant in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
to be approximately million  which was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
this amount was included in additional paid in capital and had been amortized to expense over the original vesting period of the warrant 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reached an agreement with accenture to cancel the warrant 
under this agreement  accenture relinquished its rights under the warrant in exchange for the company accepting an accelerated payment of a reduced penalty related to the level of revenue delivered through the accenture relationship and relinquishing its rights under the warrant 
the reduced penalty was received by the company and was reported in its financial statements in other income in the fourth quarter of upon cancellation of the warrant  the company adjusted the cumulative amortization expense to reflect only the percentage of the original fair value of the warrant that was vested on the date of cancellation  resulting in a reversal of the previously recognized amortization of stock based compensation expense of million in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   the company recognized  in net amortization recovery related to the warrant 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by similarly sized software and technology companies  particularly companies in new  rapidly evolving markets 
the company may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company makes certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the accounting policies and estimates which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from four primary sources i licensing software  ii providing technical support and product updates  otherwise known as maintenance iii application hosting  and iv providing professional services  including implementation and training services 
the company s software is generally sold through a perpetual license or a limited term license a subscription 
the company licenses its software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of i our software products  ii a maintenance arrangement  which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees and provides for technical support and bug fixes over a period of one year  iii hosting services  and or iv a professional services arrangement on a time and materials basis 
the company recognizes revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for one of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
the company allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the company defers revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  professional services and maintenance and recognizes revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements ie  software product when the criteria in sop have been met 
if evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time evidence of fair value does exist  or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
license revenue from contracts in which the company s services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software are recognized upon delivery  assuming the above criteria for revenue recognition are met under sop services are not considered essential if the software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt and  therefore  implementation services do not involve significant customization to or modification or development of the underlying software code 
revenue from contracts in which the company s services are essential to the functionality of the other elements of the contract is recognized using the percentage of completion method under contract accounting as services are performed or output milestones are reached  as the company delivers  customizes and installs the software 
the percentage completed is measured either by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date in relation to estimated total labor hours of the agreement or in consideration of achievement of certain output milestones  depending on the specific nature of each contract 
when output milestones are used  those milestones are typically determined from the structure of the contract in three milestones delivery of the software  completion of the initial implementation and acceptance of the project by the customer 
revenue from contracts recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones is presented as product license revenue to the extent that the underlying milestones are related to software deliveries 
in contracts with revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method based on labor hour inputs  revenues are presented as product license revenue to the extent that the underlying contracts are for software licenses based on equal application of discounts across all elements of the larger arrangement 
for arrangements in which percentage of completion accounting is used  the company records cash receipts from customers and billed amounts due from customers in excess of recognized revenue as billings in excess of revenues earned on contracts in progress 
the timing and amount of cash receipts from customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can  therefore  have a significant impact on the amount of billings in excess of revenues earned on contracts in progress at the end of any given period 
the company provides hosting services to customers that have licensed the company s software under a limited term software license 
software subscriptions have been accounted for under revenue recognition principles in accordance with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the fees related to multiple element arrangements is allocated to the individual elements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  based upon verifiable  objective evidence of the fair values of each accounting unit 
the company s subscription arrangements with customers generally include several elements  including a limited term software license a subscription  strategic consulting services  set up and software subscription services  and hosting services 
the company requires customers in these arrangements to use its hosting facilities  which in accordance with eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  results in all arrangement revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement analogous to a service arrangement 
if the arrangement includes consulting services  these services are presented as consulting and implementation service revenue and are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  which is normally months 
under sab no 
revenue recognition  costs associated with set up and implementation of the subscriptions may be expensed as incurred or deferred and recognized over the term of the related arrangement 
the company has elected to defer such costs 
the software subscription service typically begins upon customer acceptance 
limited term licenses are required to be hosted through the company s hosting services 
the company also provides hosting services to customers that have licensed the company s software on a perpetual basis 
in such cases and in accordance with eitf  the hosting revenue is considered a separate contractual element of the arrangement and is recognized according to sop fair value of the hosting services is typically based on the stated renewal rate of the hosting services  which is deemed substantive by management 
the company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the stated renewal rate for additional maintenance terms based on renewal rates charged separately to other companies 
the company s customers typically prepay maintenance for the first year in connection with new software licenses and the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement and are deemed to be substantive by management 
professional services revenue primarily consists of implementation services related to the installation of the company s software products and training revenues 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the daily rates the company charges for these services when sold independently from a software license 
substantially all of the company s professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis and  accordingly  are recognized as the services are performed 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the company classifies the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses from their customers as revenue  in the statement of operations 
accounts receivable the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material and within expectations and the allowances established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to have the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the realizablility of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
although future taxable income of the company may be sufficient to utilize a substantial amount of the benefits from the company s net operating loss carryforwards and to realize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance has been recorded to completely offset the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets as management concluded that the realization of its deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criteria under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the company recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance of million in and an addition to the valuation allowance of million and million in and  respectively  equal to the amount of the future tax asset used or generated 
management currently continues to believe that the more likely than not criteria of sfas no 
has not been met and as such continues to carry a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets
