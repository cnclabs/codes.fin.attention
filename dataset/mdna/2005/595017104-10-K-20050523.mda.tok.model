industry background competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost 
to address these requirements  manufacturers often use integrated circuit based embedded control systems that enable them to differentiate their products replace less efficient electromechanical control devices reduce the number of components in their system add product functionality decrease time to market for their products  and significantly reduce product cost 
embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide  including automotive comfort  safety and entertainment applications remote control devices handheld tools home appliances portable computers robotics cordless and cellular telephone accessories motor controls security systems educational and entertainment devices  and consumer electronics 
embedded control systems also facilitate the emergence of new classes of products when applications not previously existing become possible 
embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active  and sometimes sole  component 
a microcontroller is a self contained computer on a chip consisting of a central processing unit  non volatile program memory  random access memory for data storage and various input output peripheral capabilities 
in addition to the microcontroller  a complete embedded control system incorporates application specific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers  non volatile memory components such as eeproms  and various analog and interface products 
the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the largest segments of the semiconductor market 
microcontrollers are currently available in bit through bit architectures 
although bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive  they generally lack the minimum functionality required in most applications and are typically used in relatively simple applications 
while traditional bit and bit microcontrollers provide very high performance and functionality  they are generally too expensive for many high volume embedded control applications 
as a result  many manufacturers of competitive  high volume products have found bit microcontrollers to be the most cost effective embedded control solution 
most microcontrollers shipped today are rom based and must be programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing  resulting in week lead times  based on market conditions  for delivery of such microcontrollers 
in addition to delayed product introduction  these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required 
to address these issues  some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the customer s manufacturing line  thus significantly reducing lead time and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur 
while these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rom based microcontrollers  manufacturing technology has evolved over the last several years to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over rom based microcontrollers  thus providing significant value to microcontroller customers 
as a result  reprogrammable microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market 
our products our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions  including microcontrollers digital signal controllers high performance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices patented keeloq security assps smart battery management assps  and serial eeproms we provide highly cost effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size  high performance  low voltage power operation and ease of development  enabling timely and cost effective embedded control product integration by our customers 
microcontrollers we offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring a unique  proprietary architecture marketed under the pic brand name 
we believe that our pic product family is a price performance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market 
we have shipped over billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in our pic products are designed for applications requiring field programmability  high performance  low power and cost effectiveness 
they feature a variety of memory technology configurations  low voltage and power  small footprint and ease of use 
our performance results from an exclusive product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways  referred to as a harvard dual bus architecture  a reduced instruction set computer  referred to as risc  and variable length instructions  all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative single bus  complex instruction set computer architectures  referred to as cisc 
with over microcontrollers in our product portfolio  we target the entire performance range of bit microcontrollers 
additionally  our scalable product architecture allows us to successfully target both the entry level of the bit microcontroller market  as well as the bit microcontroller marketplace  significantly enlarging our addressable market 
we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products 
our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced  low cost user programmability feature by incorporating non volatile memory  such as flash  eeprom and eprom memory  into the microcontroller  and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 
digital signal controllers we recently began production shipments of our digital signal controller product line 
our family of dspic digital signal controllers  currently products  integrates control features of high performance bit microcontrollers with the processing capabilities of digital signal processors dsps 
during the last three fiscal years  all of our digital signal controller product development has been focused on reprogrammable flash products 
these controllers integrate a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications 
our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools  software application libraries  development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle 
with its field re programmability  large selection of peripheral functions  small footprint and ease of use  we believe that our dspic controllers will significantly enlarge our addressable market 
development systems we offer a comprehensive set of low cost and easy to learn application development tools 
these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic digital signal controllers for specific applications and are a key factor for obtaining design wins 
our family of development tools operates in the standard windows environment on standard pc hardware 
these tools range from entry level systems  which include an assembler and programmer or in circuit debugging hardware  to fully configured systems that provide in circuit emulation hardware 
customers moving from entry level designs to those requiring real time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our systems share the same integrated development environment 
many independent companies also develop and market application development tools and systems that support our standard microcontroller product architecture 
currently  there are more than third party tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 
we believe that familiarity with and adoption of our  and third party  development systems by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products 
these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of application specific products from our standard microcontrollers 
to date  we have shipped more than  development systems 
assps our application specific standard products  referred to as assps  are specialized products designed to perform specific end user applications  compared to our other products that are more general purpose in nature 
our assp device families currently include  among others  our keeloq family of secure data transmission products and smart battery management products 
analog and interface products our analog and interface products now consist of several families with over power management  linear  mixed signal  thermal management and interface products 
at the end of fiscal  our mixed signal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than  end customers 
we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base  which we refer to as our analog attach strategy  as well as to new customers 
in addition to our attach strategy  we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base 
we market these  and all of our products  based on an application segment approach  targeted to solve different problems in development of our customers products 
memory products our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory  referred to as eeproms 
we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market  and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide 
eeprom products are used for non volatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods 
serial eeproms have a very low i o pin requirement  permitting production of very small devices 
we address customer requirements by offering products with extremely small package sizes and very low operating voltages for both read and write functions 
our memory products also feature long data retention and high erase write endurance 
manufacturing our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test 
the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy  enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry 
by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations  and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques  we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields 
direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles 
this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 
our manufacturing facilities are located in tempe  arizona fab chandler  arizona probe operations puyallup  washington fab non operational gresham  oregon fab  and bangkok  thailand assembly and test 
wafer fabrication fab currently produces inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes between and microns 
during fiscal  fab operated at approximately of its capacity compared to approximately during fiscal operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing 
on june   we completed closure of our chandler  arizona fab wafer fabrication facility and integrated certain fab personnel and processes into our tempe  arizona fab wafer fabrication facility 
the facility where fab is located is an integral part of our overall campus in chandler  arizona 
within this same facility resides our wafer probe  mask making and other manufacturing related activities 
we have no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations  and intend to leave it in an idle status 
fab is currently non operational and being held for future use 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special charges fab impairment charge  below at page  for a discussion of the status of fab fab was acquired by us in august and began production on october  fab produces inch wafers using micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below microns 
fab has reached a level of production where costs and efficiencies have met our initial expectations 
fab costs on comparable technologies are in fact lower than those of fab we have a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment still to be placed in service at fab that was acquired in the original acquisition of fab that we can bring on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 
we believe the combined capacity of fab  fab and fab will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand 
we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs 
we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 
our future operating results could be adversely affected if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
we also contract with third party wafer foundries to fabricate less than of our total production 
on a strategic basis  we will continue to use third party foundries to shorten our product design cycle on certain key technologies and products 
assembly and test we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok  thailand 
at march   approximately of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility 
as of march   our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production 
a  square foot expansion area that was placed in service in fiscal provides the thailand facility with sufficient space for our projected expansion needs in fiscal we also use third party assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 
general matters impacting our manufacturing operations we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products 
we believe our processes afford us both cost effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs 
while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines  we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non volatile memory products 
this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly 
our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design  simulation and layout  and our in house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 
due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing  consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results 
during fiscal  our focus on manufacturing productivity allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities 
our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control  extensive employee training and selective upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment 
maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results 
the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits  particularly non volatile  erasable cmos memory and logic devices  such as those that we produce  are complex processes 
these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 
our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards 
we generally have more than one source for these supplies  but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards 
in addition  the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases 
we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past  and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders 
an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources could harm our business 
our reliance on third parties for a portion of wafer fabrication and assembly and testing involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract 
while we review the quality  delivery and cost performance of these third party contractors  our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields  assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
the foregoing statements related to the combined capacity of fab  fab and fab providing sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to future increases in demand and the transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others changes in utilization of our current manufacturing capacity  unanticipated costs in ramping production at fab  our ability to increase production at fab  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the portland  oregon area  changes in demand for products and the products of our customers  supply disruption  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other direct manufacturing costs  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in product mix  competitive pressures on prices  labor unrest  political instability and expropriation  and other general economic conditions 
at the end of fiscal  we owned long lived assets consisting of property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the united states amounting to million and million in other countries  including million in thailand 
at the end of fiscal  we owned long lived assets in the united states amounting to million and million in other countries  including million in thailand 
research and development r d we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products  including development systems  and in our design and manufacturing process technologies 
we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position 
our current r d activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers  digital signal controllers  assps  memory and mixed signal products  new development systems  software and application specific software libraries 
we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 
in fiscal  our r d expenses were million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and distribution general we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 
our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas  europe and asia 
we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america  europe and asia 
we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market 
the majority of our field sales engineers fses  field application engineers faes  and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment 
we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products 
the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams 
faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world  and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and end user support 
distribution our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers 
we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base 
in fiscal  we derived of our net sales from sales through distributors and of our net sales from direct sales to original equipment manufacturers  referred to as oem customers 
distributors accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal our largest distributor accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal our second largest distributor accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  one distributor accounted for of our net sales 
no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  or distributors generally have broad based rights to return product to us 
as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product to their end customers  distributor returns have no impact on our revenue 
we also grant certain credits to our third party distributors and also offer these distributors price protection 
the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers 
the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer 
the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 
we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions  competitive considerations and other factors 
price protection is granted to third party distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered 
when we reduce the selling price of our products  it allows the distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the date of the price reduction 
there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection activity 
we do not offer material incentive programs to our third party distributors 
we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and we  or our distributors  may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advanced notice 
the loss of  or the disruption in the operations of  one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 
sales by geography sales by geography for fiscal  and were as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  americas europe asia total sales sales to customers in asia have increased as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal we attribute this primarily to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia 
sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe  which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive  communications  computing  consumer and industrial control products 
americas sales include sales to customers in the united states  canada  central america and south america 
sales to customers in china  including hong kong  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  approximately of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal in fiscal  sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately of our net sales 
we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded of our net sales during fiscal  or our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated 
although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions  we have not experienced any material difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date 
our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks as described under the heading  we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  on page backlog as of april   our backlog was approximately million  compared to million as of april  our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent months 
we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order 
our business and  to a large extent  that of the entire semiconductor industry  is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules  or to cancellation at the customer s option without significant penalty 
thus  while backlog is useful for scheduling production  backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
emerging companies may also increase their participation in the market for embedded control applications 
furthermore  capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position 
we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products  including the following product characteristics speed functionality density power consumption reliability packaging alternatives price  and availability 
we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include ease of use functionality of application development systems dependable delivery and quality  and technical service and support 
we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors  but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future  which could harm our business 
patents  licenses and trademarks we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents  expiring on various dates between and we also have numerous additional united states and foreign patent applications pending 
we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business 
while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes  we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments  rather than on our patents 
our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and cross licenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we and our customers have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies 
we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate 
based on industry practice  we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms  but we cannot assure that licenses would be on acceptable terms  that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management  may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights  or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or litigation arising out of infringement claims  could harm our business 
environmental regulation we must comply with many different federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes 
our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations 
any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by us to control adequately the storage  use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations 
while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations  our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations

additional factors that may affect our results of operations when evaluating microchip and its business  you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below  in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 
our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability  many of which are beyond our control 
some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory levels of inventories at our customers changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields our ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity competitive developments including pricing pressures the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter the level of sell through of our products through distribution changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers ability to ship their products  which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers costs and outcomes of any tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual property  customers or other issues disruptions in our business or our customers businesses due to terrorist activity  armed conflict  war  worldwide oil prices and supply  public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system property damage or other losses which are not covered by insurance  and general economic  industry or political conditions in the united states or internationally 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance 
in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 
our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 
the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits  particularly non volatile  erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce  are complex processes 
these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 
our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity 
lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins 
we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter  which we refer to as turns orders 
we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter 
historically  we have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy  resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules 
shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments 
turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times 
because turns orders are difficult to predict  varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast 
if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets  our revenue and operating results may suffer 
intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures  reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market for embedded control applications 
we may be unable to compete successfully in the future  which could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control  including the quality  performance  reliability  features  ease of use  pricing and diversity of our products our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own applications product introductions by our competitors the number  nature and success of our competitors in a given market our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights the quality of our customer service and our ability to address the needs of our customers  and general market and economic conditions 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product 
the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant  while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and non proprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines  due primarily to competitive conditions 
we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices 
we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products 
we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which could adversely impact our operating results 
our business is highly dependent on selling through distributors 
sales through distributors accounted for of our net sales in fiscal  of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal and approximately of our net sales in fiscal we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice 
the loss of  or a disruption in the operations of  one or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 
our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors  including proper new product selection timely completion and introduction of new product designs development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use  and market acceptance of our customers end products 
because our products are complex  we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products 
in addition  our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance 
we may be unable to design  develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis  which could adversely impact our future operating results 
our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies 
semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant r d expenditures 
we and other companies in the industry have  from time to time  experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and  consequently  have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries 
our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful  and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management  engineering and other personnel 
the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is intense 
we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business 
we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 
we are dependent on several third party contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 
we use several third party contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products 
we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication 
although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources  the disruption or termination of any of our third party contractors could harm our business and operating results 
our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract 
our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor were to experience financial  operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity  or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields  assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels  or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption 
in such case  we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on favorable terms to us 
in such event  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 
our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards 
we generally have more than one source for these supplies  but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards 
the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases 
we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past  and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts 
an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources  or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment  could harm our business 
our operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant economic downturns  characterized by diminished product demand and production over capacity 
we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced  to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments 
however  we have experienced substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results and expect  in the future  to experience period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 
we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
we are currently  and in the future may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  contracts and other matters 
from october to october  we were involved in patent infringement litigation with philips corporation which has since been settled 
however  as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of a matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend our position  we could incur uninsured liability in any one of them and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses related to the defense of such claims or any requirement to pay damages claims 
we do have product liability insurance  but there is no certainty that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims 
costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 
our ability to obtain patents  licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success 
to that end  we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications 
in addition  our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office  which can require significant financial and management resources 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into customer contracts  the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of any early termination of a contract by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue source which could harm our financial results 
business interruptions could harm our business 
operations at any of our manufacturing facilities  or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors  may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control  including work stoppages  power loss  incidents of terrorism or security risk  political instability  public health issues  telecommunications  transportation or other infrastructure failure  fire  earthquake  floods  or other natural disasters 
if operations at any of our facilities  or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted  we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis 
if this occurs  we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms 
this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers 
in addition  business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 
we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were made to foreign customers 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were made to foreign customers 
we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers 
in addition  we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok  thailand 
we also use various foreign third party contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements 
substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 
our reliance on foreign operations  foreign suppliers  maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  including political  social and economic instability public health conditions trade restrictions and changes in tariffs import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing international operations employment regulations disruptions in international transport or delivery fluctuations in currency exchange rates difficulties in collecting receivables economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize  our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 
we are subject to stringent environmental regulations  which may force us to incur significant expenses 
we must comply with many different federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations 
any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 
environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 
further  certain of our customers shipping their products into european markets are also subject to governmental environmental regulations such as the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs which will be effective july   and the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment 
these directives focus on limiting the amounts of certain elements  such as lead  in electrical devices  and providing for the proper disposal of the electrical devices and their components 
the inability of this sub set of our customers to use microchip products which contain lead after july may adversely affect our results of operations 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations have resulted in increased costs to us 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and recent rules enacted and proposed by the sec  nasdaq and the nyse  have resulted in significantly increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements 
in particular  complying with the internal control audit requirements of sarbanes oxley section has resulted in increased internal efforts and significantly higher fees from our independent accounting firm 
this report on form k contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march  this form k also contains an attestation and report by our auditors with respect to our management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section while these assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  compliance with section is an ongoing process and will be required for each future fiscal year 
we expect that the ongoing compliance with section will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses with not be identified in future periods 
any adverse results from such ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
recent regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our earnings and our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages and have accounted for them using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use no of vesting  encourage employees to remain with microchip 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payments  sfas r which changed us generally accepted accounting principles in such a way to require us to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee stock option grants and other share based compensation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal this regulation will negatively impact our earnings for those share based awards that vest beginning in fiscal for example  recording a charge for employee stock options under sfas would have decreased our net income by million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the impact on net income of sfas r may differ significantly than the impact as calculated under sfas furthermore  adoption of sfas r will require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of stock options that we may grant in the future 
a change in any of those assumptions or judgments could change the compensation expense that is charged against our earnings and  consequently  adversely affect our results of operations 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies share based payment 
in addition  recent regulations implemented by the nasdaq stock market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans as well as recent regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant equity based awards to employees in the future 
to the extent that these or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur compensation costs  productivity losses  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating results of other technology companies actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance or buy sell recommendations changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and worldwide economic and financial conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock

fab consists of manufacturing buildings and land  with no equipment 
acquired in august production commenced on october  located in the alphatechnopolis industrial park near bangkok on land to which we expect to acquire title in accordance with our agreement with the landowner 
progress towards obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a complex financial restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land 
at this time it is not possible to estimate when  or if  full title transfer will be completed 
we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title 
such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land 
in addition to the facilities we own  we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in north america  europe and asia 
our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately million 
we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements for the next months 
the foregoing statements related to the acquisition of title to the land on which the thailand facility is situated and the adequacy of existing facilities for the next months are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others developments in the financial restructuring of the seller of the land where the thailand facility is situated  demand for our products  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  competitive pressures on prices  political instability and expropriation  and other economic conditions

fiscal during the march quarter  we implemented capacity and cost reduction actions necessitated by adverse business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
we reduced cumulative wafer fab capacity at fabs and by approximately  compared to our december  levels 
we also decided to close our hong kong test facility  acquired as part of the telcom transaction  and migrate these test requirements to our thailand test facility 
the capacity reduction at fabs and was completed by the end of the march quarter 
the closure of the hong kong facility was completed by june  these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of million in the march quarter 
these actions were undertaken to reduce both manufacturing capacity and manufacturing costs 
the reduction in wafer fab capacity was required due to reduced customer demand 
the closure of the hong kong facility was undertaken to rationalize our test manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements to our more cost effective test facility in thailand 
included in the restructuring charges resulting from these actions were million related to equipment that was written off million related to employee severance costs  and million related to other restructuring costs 
on january   we completed our merger with telcom
