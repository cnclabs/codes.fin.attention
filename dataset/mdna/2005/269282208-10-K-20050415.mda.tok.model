critical accounting policies exx has prepared its financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this has required exx to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affected the amounts exx reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements contains the significant accounting principles used to prepare exx s consolidated financial statements 
exx has identified a few critical accounting policies that required exx to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of our estimates 
had different estimates and assumptions been used  the amounts recorded could have been significantly different 
additionally  actual results that would have a material effect on exx s accounting policies that were affected by the estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of exx s financial statements are listed below 
inventories 
certain of exx s inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
the remainder of exx s inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
exx periodically assesses this inventory for obsolescence and potential excess by reducing the difference between the cost and the estimated market value of the inventory based on assumptions about future demand and historical sales patterns 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than exx s current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on exx s reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
income taxes 
exx complies with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
exx has determined that it is more likely than not that exx s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
intangible assets 
intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful or economical lives and include provisions for patents  customer lists and customer relationships 
please see footnote for further explanation 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets 
a loss is recognized when expected discounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the impairment loss is the difference by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
please refer to note for an explanation of impairment charges in pension accounting 
the company utilizes certain assumptions in the actuarially determined values of its periodic pension cost and pension benefit obligation 
such assumptions include the discount rate of and the expected rate of return on plan assets of  which are used in determining the periodic pension cost 
please refer to note for an explanation of the pension accounting as well as the related current charges and credits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exx s cash and cash equivalent investments are in short term money market investments  us treasury money market investments  government agency obligations and commercial paper
