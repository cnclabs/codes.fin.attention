item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tables shown in thousands of dollars  except per share amounts the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and other information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we design  market  and administer compensation and benefit programs for companies supplementing and securing employee benefits and provide executive compensation and related consulting services to us corporations  banks  and healthcare organizations 
we generally compete with regional firms while we market our products and services nationwide 
a majority of our revenues result from commissions paid by insurance companies that underwrite the insurance policies used to finance our clients benefit programs 
most of our clients benefit programs are financed by business owned life insurance and other financial products 
we pay commissions to employees and independent producers based upon a percentage of our commission revenue 
we work closely with clients to design customized products that meet the specific organizational needs of the client and with insurance companies to develop unique policy features and competitive pricing 
a significant portion of our growth has been acquisition related 
business owned life insurance programs have tax advantages associated with the products that are attractive to our clients 
a portion of our product offerings are interest rate sensitive 
changes in tax and legislative laws can have an affect on our business  as seen over the last several years with our executive benefits practice 
we have been expanding our compensation consulting practices to diversify our product offerings 
the largest component of our general and administrative expenses is salary and other employee related costs 
recent developments tax and legislative initiatives in recent years  the internal revenue service irs has undertaken a major enforcement initiative to disallow the interest deductions on certain leveraged business owned life insurance programs sold during or prior to the irs has  with one exception  prevailed on the cases it has litigated to date related to this initiative and recently made a temporary now expired public settlement offer to address ongoing cases 
while we stopped selling leveraged business owned life insurance programs after and we do not expect any material adverse impact on our revenue from this enforcement initiative  it is impossible to determine the impact of this initiative on a client s decision to continue or surrender an existing leveraged business owned life insurance program 
there have been several recent legislative proposals to change the federal tax laws with respect to business owned life insurance 
on september   the senate finance committee approved legislation proposed by sen 
jeff bingaman d nm that would tax the death benefits taxpayers receive from certain policies on the lives of former employees 
following an intensive lobbying effort by the insurance industry  the finance committee on february   reconsidered the business owned life insurance provision it had previously approved and  in its place  approved legislation that generally would tax the death benefits taxpayers receive from policies on the lives of employees or former employees only in cases where the insured person had not consented to being covered or in the case of a former employee  or where the insured was not among the company s highly compensated employees at the time of policy issuance 
this same provision was reintroduced on january   by senate finance committee chairman charles grassley r ia and senator max baucus d mt as part of the national employee savings and trust equity guarantee act s 

we believe that this most recent proposal  if enacted  would not have a material adverse effect on our revenue from the sale of business owned life insurance policies 
however  if congress were to adopt legislation broadly limiting the tax free payment of death benefits on such policies or otherwise adversely affecting the tax treatment of the policies  future revenue from sale of business owned life insurance policies could materially decline 
on october   president bush signed into law hr  the american jobs creation act of  which included provisions affecting deferred compensation arrangements for taxable and tax exempt employers 
the legislation created new section a of the internal revenue code which will apply to voluntary deferred compensation arrangements  supplemental executive retirement plans  stock appreciation rights sars and certain other arrangements which have the effect of deferring compensation 
section a will generally apply to compensation deferrals made after december  among other things  section a will modify the times at which distributions are permitted from nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements and will require that elections to defer compensation be made earlier than is current practice for many plans 
the treasury department and the irs issued their initial guidance regarding section a  notice  on december  this initial guidance provides for the transition to the new rules contained in section a and further guidance is expected during most existing deferred compensation programs will have to be modified in accordance with the new rules 
during the transition period  it is expected that plan sponsors will revise the structure of their current programs and formalize the changes into a compliant plan design by the end of we believe that deferred compensation plans remain a valuable savings tool 
however  because of the time and effort required by plan sponsors to come into compliance with the new rules and to communicate the required changes to participants  participant compensation deferrals may be reduced 
as a result  our revenue from existing and new arrangements may be reduced during the transitional period 
beyond the transitional period  it is anticipated that participant deferrals will return to their prior level  although the long term impact of the new rules remains uncertain at this time 
as a result of issues arising recently in connection with the marketing by certain companies in the property and casualty insurance  health insurance  and group life insurance markets  there have been a series of proposals to modify various state laws and regulations regarding insurance agents and brokers  including proposals by the california insurance commissioner and the national association of insurance commissioners 
these proposals  if one or more are adopted  could impose new legal obligations  including disclosure obligations  on us with respect to the insurance and other financial products we market 
these proposals are at an early stage and are likely to move forward during there was also a hearing on similar issues in november in a us senate committee 
depending on the changes  if any  which are actually adopted by the federal government or by the states where we market insurance  there could be an adverse impact on our revenues 
change in insurable interest laws there have been several recent proposals in various states eg  georgia  texas  illinois  and washington to change the insurable interest and other state laws governing the ability of an employer to purchase or hold life insurance on the lives of employees 
in  california enacted legislation prohibiting the purchase of business owned life insurance on the lives of employees not exempt from wage and hour laws a group of employees not typically insured under the arrangements we market 
significant segments of the life insurance industry are engaged in an ongoing  intensive effort to prevent the enactment of state law changes that would have an adverse impact on business owned life insurance 
if one or more states were to adopt proposals broadly limiting the ability of employers to purchase or hold life insurance on the lives of employees  the market for these policies would be reduced and a number of existing policies could be surrendered or exchanged  with a resulting reduction in our revenues from these arrangements 
other on january   our board of directors authorized us to pay a dividend of per share to all stockholders of record as of march   payable on april  we intend to pay a similar dividend each quarter  assuming we have adequate capital availability  that we continue to be permitted to pay dividends under our senior credit facility  and that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of our stockholders and us 
the board of directors also authorized us to expand our existing stock repurchase program to a total of million of our outstanding common stock  from the previously authorized level of million 
as a result of the surrender of a number of insurance policies by a single customer of ours in december  we will cease receiving commissions and related payments in respect of such surrendered insurance policies 
we estimate that the amount of such commissions and related payments is approximately million per year  which is less than one percent of our renewal commission revenues in the amount of commissions and related payments included in the securitization will be directed solely to the payment of principal and interest on the notes and related administration fees and expenses associated with the securitization until such time as the reserve account established as part of the securitization is replenished 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and the results of operations  and which require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue sources and recognition our operating segments derive revenue primarily from o commissions paid by insurance companies issuing the policies underlying our benefit programs  o program design and administrative service fees paid by our clients  o executive compensation and benefit and related consulting fees  and o fees for legislative liaison and related advisory services 
our commission revenue is normally recurring  is typically paid annually and usually extends for a period of twenty years or more after the sale 
commissions are paid by insurance companies and vary by policy and by program and typically represent a percentage of the premium or the cash surrender value of the insurance policies underlying the program 
first year commission revenue and related fees 
first year commission revenue and related fees are derived from two principal sources a the commission we earn when the client first purchases the policies  which revenue is recognized at the time the application is substantially completed  the client is contractually committed to purchase the insurance policies and the premiums are paid which is the effective date of the insurance policy by the client to the insurance company or  in certain instances  when cash is received  and b fees for the services related to the enrollment and initial administration of the benefit programs and underlying policies 
our first year commission revenue is frequently subject to chargeback  which means that insurance companies retain the right to recover commissions paid in the event policies prematurely terminate 
the chargeback schedules differ by product and usually apply to first year commission only 
a typical chargeback schedule  based on a percent of first year commission  is as follows year year and year year and beyond given the homogenous nature of such cases and historical information about chargebacks  we believe we are able to accurately estimate the revenue earned 
we currently maintain a chargeback allowance  which is monitored on a quarterly basis for adequacy 
the chargeback allowance is calculated based on the average percentage rate of the last two years of chargebacks multiplied by the first year revenue for the trailing twelve months 
renewal commission revenue and related fees 
renewal revenue is recognized on the date that the renewal premium is due or paid by the client to the insurance company depending on whether a policy is considered fixed or variable 
fixed renewal policies have predictable set premium amounts 
revenue on these policies is recognized on the premium due date 
variable renewal policy premiums can be based upon such items as value of underlying investments in the policy  cash surrender value of the policy  or mutual fund values 
in some cases  we are able to obtain information directly from the carriers allowing us to reasonably and reliably estimate the expected renewal premiums 
revenue is recognized based upon these estimates at a policy s renewal date 
for those policies where we are unable to obtain information to reasonably estimate the expected renewal premiums  revenue is not recognized until the confirmation has been received from the insurance carrier that the client s premium payment has been received 
we are notified in advance if a client plans to surrender  so adjustments in subsequent periods due to cancellations are infrequent and minor 
revenue associated with policies to be surrendered is not recognized 
consulting fee revenue 
consulting fee revenue consists of fees charged by pearl meyer partners  human capital practice  and federal policy group for the services we perform in advising our clients on their executive compensation programs and related consulting services  retirement  benefit  actuarial  pension savings plan design and management  people strategy  compensation surveys  institutional registered investment advisory services  and fees from legislative and regulatory policy matters 
these fees are generally based on a rate per hour arrangement or a fixed monthly fee and are earned when the service is rendered 
consulting revenue generated by the executive benefits practice  banking practice  and healthcare group is included in the first year revenue line on our consolidated statements of income 
administrative service fee revenue 
administrative service fee revenues consist of fees we charge our clients for the administration of their benefit programs and are earned when services are rendered 
these revenues are mainly included in our renewal revenue line on our consolidated statements of income 
supplemental compensation arrangements 
a portion of our revenue is derived from certain supplemental compensation arrangements with insurance carriers 
these arrangements generate additional revenue with respect to primarily existing and  to a lesser extent  new blocks of business 
payments under such arrangements are typically based on the cash value or fair value of our existing in force business with these carriers at specified dates of measurement and  to a much lesser extent  based on the value of new business generated 
we realized approximately million  million and million in revenue under such arrangements for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
we record revenue on a gross basis when we o act as the principal in the transaction by helping clients select the right product or service  o take responsibility for the acceptability of the products and services  o provide services through employees and exclusive independent producers  o have latitude in establishing the price the customer will pay  o have discretion in carrier selection with multiple carriers  o have chargeback and credit risk  and or o are viewed by the client as the administrator of the program once the product is sold 
we record revenue on a net basis when we provide a lead on a case in the capacity of a finder and another company has control of the case and bears the credit risk ie  working directly with a client to determine the product and design of the plan 
intangible assets our intangible assets include the excess of the costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the tangible net assets associated with an acquisition 
intangible assets also consist of the net present value of future cash flows from policies inforce at the acquisition date  non compete agreements with the former owners  other identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
non compete agreements are amortized over the period of the agreements and other identifiable intangibles are amortized over their useful lives 
the net present value of inforce revenue is typically amortized between and years the expected average policy duration 
the determination of the amortization schedule involves making certain assumptions related to persistency  expenses  and discount rates that are used in the calculation of the carrying value of inforce revenue 
if any of these assumptions change or actual experience differs materially from the assumptions used  it could affect the carrying value of the inforce revenue 
we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and the net present value of future cash flows from policies inforce  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  mortality  lapse  and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by federal and various state authorities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider the likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
restructuring costs we make provisions for restructuring costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
to determine the amounts expensed in any period  we estimate the amounts we will receive in the future for subleasing office space that is no longer required for our existing operations 
should these estimates not reflect actual results in future periods  we adjust the provision through the income statement 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  financial statement overview 
our revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
our net income for was million  compared to million in diluted earnings per share for were  compared to for revenue 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of from revenues of million for the year ended december  first year revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  first year revenue of the banking practice was million less for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  due to clients efforts in mid to lock in interest rates prior to anticipated interest rate reductions in late revenue for the years ended december  and included approximately million and million  respectively  related to supplemental compensation arrangements with insurance carriers 
renewal revenue for the year ended december   was compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in renewal revenue is primarily the result of over funding of certain corporate plans 
consulting fees as a percentage of total revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  for the year ended december   executive compensation consulting services experienced an increase in demand over the prior year due to increased focus on corporate governance and executive compensation 
commission and fee expense 
commission and fee expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the amount paid in commission expense both in dollar terms and as a percent of revenue declined primarily due to an increasing percentage of sales by employee consultants who have a lower commission rate than independent producers 
in the second half of  banking practice acquired two of its former independent producer organizations 
some of the commission savings from sales by employees is spent in the form of increased operating expenses 
independent producers cover their operating expenses out of their commissions 
also impacting the commission percentage to revenue is the higher amounts of supplemental compensation arrangement revenues and consulting revenues that have no related commission expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to expenditures associated with sarbanes oxley compliance million and approximately million of legal fees associated with the macdonald litigation 
the macdonald litigation was settled with no cash being exchanged during the year ended december  also contributing to the increase was approximately million of additional bonus expense associated with the improved operating results versus amortization 
amortization expense decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  for the three months ended september   there were costs of approximately thousand relating to an adjustment to the purchase accounting for the longmiller acquisition 
the remaining decline is based on the timing of scheduled amortization of our inforce revenue streams purchased in acquisitions 
other operating expenses 
the year ended december  results included a million favorable settlement of litigation that reduced operating expenses 
human capital practice reorganization 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice

we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization  of which million remains on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  during the year ended december   we recorded net decreases to expense of approximately thousand 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december   includes a million write off of costs associated with a prospective securitization financing that was terminated in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease relates to lower borrowing levels in compared to income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million  an effective tax rate of  compared to million  an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  there were net adjustments of approximately thousand reducing income tax expense for the year ended december  reflecting favorable revisions to our state income tax rate as a result of implementation of several strategies aimed at reducing state taxes 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share  versus net income of million  or per diluted share  for the same period last year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue

first year commission revenue for included million related to supplemental compensation arrangements with two of our insurance carriers in which we received additional payments and revenue based on the cash value of our existing inforce revenue with these carriers 
first year commission revenue in included million related to an agreement with another insurance carrier  which was executed in commission and fee expense 
commission and fee expense was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december   versus million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the reduction in commission expense as a percentage of revenue reflects an increase in the percentage of revenue generated from employee consultants 
additionally  a higher percentage of revenue was renewal revenues as compared to 
generally  renewal revenues have a lower commission rate than first year revenues 
we do not pay commission  or any other related expenses  on the revenue associated with the supplemental compensation arrangements 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  from the prior year as a result of a full year of expense from the acquisitions  such as longmiller and federal policy group  and the may hiring of former arthur andersen human capital practice partners and employees  included for the entire year of general and administrative expense for the year ended december  included approximately million in charges  primarily related to severance costs and lease terminations in our executive benefits practice and healthcare group  and approximately million relating to the corporate re branding effort as a result of our name change 
general and administrative expenses increase as we add more employees as opposed to independent producers 
amortization 
amortization expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year period 
we acquired approximately million of inforce revenue with our november acquisition of longmiller 
the acquisition of longmiller added approximately million of amortization expense in as a result of a full year of amortization of the net present value of inforce revenue and non compete agreements 
the results included one month of amortization related to this intangible asset 
settlement of litigation 
during the year ended december   we received million from a favorable lawsuit settlement 
human capital practice reorganization 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice 
in addition  several partners and staff members were terminated which resulted in exiting certain activities of the human capital practice and creating unused leased office space in numerous cities 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization  of which million remained on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  no similar costs were recorded in interest expense 
interest expense for the year december  was million compared to million in to finance the november acquisition of longmiller  we borrowed approximately million on our line of credit and issued million of non recourse insurance revenue asset backed notes 
the increased outstanding borrowings were responsible for the increase in interest expense 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million  an effective tax rate of  compared to million  an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  reflects thousand of net state tax refunds relating to prior years 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the true up of the estimated state tax liability 
net income 
net income  for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share  versus net income of million after an impairment charge of thousand  net of taxes  from the adoption of sfas no 
 or per diluted share  for the same period in the prior year 
the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding increased to million shares for the year ended december  from million shares for the year ended december  acquisition strategy our acquisition criteria focuses on the quality of management  future earnings  and the strategic fit with our company  as well as the growth potential of the target company 
in several of our acquisitions  we also acquire the financial value embedded in a book of recurring renewal business that is expected to be realized for many years after the acquisition takes place 
historically  our future renewal revenue stream has been the source of collateral for our line of credit  which we frequently use for acquisitions 
as we acquire more businesses that do not have this attribute  this may limit our future borrowing availability 
we typically structure a majority of the purchase price in cash 
we acquire little in the way of tangible assets  thus creating a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet 
the companies we acquire are frequently privately owned and structured as subchapter s corporations and the acquisitions are usually effected through a purchase of assets with the income taxed directly to the stockholders of the target 
from time to time we are involved in negotiations relating to the acquisition of companies in our industry or related industries 
some of these negotiations could involve companies whose acquisition would be highly material to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in connection with negotiating such transactions  even if the transactions are not completed 
human capital practice reorganization in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice 
in addition  four partners and six staff members were terminated which resulted in exiting certain activities of the practice and creating unused leased office space in numerous cities 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization of which million remains on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as a result of the restructuring  we leveraged the pearl meyer partners brand name for executive compensation consulting  eliminated confusion in the marketplace regarding our practices and their markets  and significantly lowered the cost structure for the remaining human capital practice 
the remaining business of the human capital practice in consisted of actuarial retirement plan and investment advisory services 
effective january   the human capital practice was merged into the executive benefits practice 
supplemental compensation arrangements during the first quarter of  we completed agreements with two of our insurance carriers  which will generate additional revenue on our existing blocks of business and future business 
the length of one of the contracts is three years and the other contract is one year 
the agreements resulted in revenue of approximately thousand for the year ended december  the two new agreements provide for revenue of approximately thousand per quarter and include a variable element tied to our quarterly sales of the carrier s products 
future payment amounts would be negatively impacted by potential future surrenders of the inforce business or non renewal of the agreements and positively impacted by asset growth of these contracts 
during the third quarter of  we completed agreements with two of our core insurance carriers  which will generate additional revenue on our existing blocks of business with these carriers 
the length of one of the contracts is five and one half years and the other contract is one year 
the contracts automatically renew each year unless notice is given by one of the parties 
the agreements resulted in revenue of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and provide for additional payments upon certain conditions and measurement dates 
the future payment amounts are based on the cash value or fair value of our existing inforce business with these carriers at specified dates of measurement 
future payment amounts would be negatively impacted by potential future surrenders of the inforce business or non renewal of the agreements and positively impacted by asset growth of these contracts 
on september   we entered into an administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement with an affiliate of ausa holding  inc  one of our principal stockholders and insurance carrier 
we received approximately million and million of payments in and  respectively related to this agreement 
during  we received million for services rendered prior to and through september  and recognized a total of million of revenue in  pursuant to this agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we expect to continue to receive approximately million annually from the carrier for a period of years  depending upon certain conditions 
of this annual amount million is included in the cash flows securitizing the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller  and we will not have access to this cash for general corporate purposes until the securitized notes are fully paid 
this revenue  net of amounts provided for chargebacks  is being recognized on a monthly basis 
the amounts received are subject to chargeback reimbursement of a portion of amounts received if any policies under this agreement are surrendered or exchanged 
any chargeback amounts would be deducted from the next scheduled payment 
segment results the following analysis depicts the results of each of our operating segments on a stand alone basis 
the practices are allocated a charge to cover centralized resource center expenditures in the areas of human resources  marketing  and information technology

renewal revenue for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in first year revenues was partially offset by decreases in renewal revenues relating to the loss of three large clients million and over funding of certain corporate plans 
commission expense as a percentage of total revenue declined to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to the mix of sales by employee consultants who are paid a lower commission and the mix between first year versus renewal revenue 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was lower than the year ended december   due mainly to lower headcount for and for and facility costs despite a charge of approximately million for legal costs associated with the macdonald settlement in june of first year revenue for the year ended december  was approximately million lower than for the year ended december   in the executive benefits practice  reflecting the continued difficult economic and legislative environment  which most directly affects this segment of the business 
first year revenue for the year ended december   includes approximately thousand from the execution of a supplemental compensation arrangement with one of our insurance carriers 
renewal revenue also declined approximately million from the year ended december   as a result of split dollar legislation and lower deferrals into executive benefit plans 
commission expense as a percentage of total revenue declined from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   due to the higher percentage of sales by employees who are paid on a lower commission grid 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   includes approximately thousand of restructuring charges recorded for the ongoing consolidation of the business support services and thousand of charges associated with other severance agreements and lease terminations 
banking practice operating results year ended december  total revenue    operating expenses commissions and fees    other operating expenses    operating income    of revenue total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  first year revenues for the year ended december  were impacted by a soft market for boli products  interest rates  and sales force changes that occurred in the second quarter of total revenue for the year ended december  and included approximately million and million  respectively  related to supplemental compensation arrangements 
renewal revenue for the year ended december  and december   was million and million  respectively 
commission expense for the year ended december   was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the same period in the commission expense as a percentage of revenue continues to decrease as a result of a higher percentage of first year revenue produced by employee consultants versus independent producers and the mix between first year revenues and renewal revenues 
in addition  we do not pay commission expense on the revenue associated with the supplemental compensation arrangements 
in the second half of  banking practice acquired two of its former independent producer organizations 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the comparable period in we terminated seventeen of our banking practice employees  representing roughly of the practice s employees  or of our employees in september of the actions resulted in thousand of severance costs and are expected to result in annual operating expense savings of approximately million 
the higher percentage of general and administrative expenses to revenue reflects increased operating expenses relating to former independent producers and the lower revenue base 
amortization expense for the year ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the decrease is based on the timing of scheduled amortization of our inforce revenue and a thousand adjustment to the purchase accounting for the longmiller acquisition in the third quarter of total first year revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue in from the large bank sector of the business declined significantly from due to the sustained low interest rate environment 
increases in the community bank sector more than offset the first year revenue decrease in the large bank sector 
renewal revenue for the year ended december  includes million related to the administrative services agreement entered into on september  with an affiliate of ausa holding  inc along with million in first year revenue from the execution of supplemental compensation arrangements with two other insurance carriers during approximately million of the increase in renewal revenue is attributable to the securitized inforce revenue stream from the acquisition of longmiller 
commission expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the same period in the commission expense as a percentage of revenue continues to decrease as a result of a higher percentage of first year revenue produced by employees 
in addition  a larger percentage of total revenue consisted of renewal revenue  which has a lower commission expense percentage 
we do not pay commission expense on the revenue associated with the supplemental compensation arrangements 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the comparable period in expenses included twelve months for the longmiller operation compared to one month in  and operating expenses for the fourth quarter acquisition of shoemaker and blackwood 
the lower percentage of general and administrative expenses to revenue reflects the relatively lower costs associated with the revenue stream from the longmiller acquisition 
healthcare group operating results year ended december  total revenue    operating expenses commissions and fees    other operating expenses    operating income    of revenue healthcare group revenues were slightly lower for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
first year commission revenue for the year ended december   was lower by million than the prior year due to a lower number of new implementation projects and lower add on commissions as a result of split dollar regulations and clients electing to split consulting engagements from the company who sells the funding solution 
however  consulting revenue included in first year revenue increased over the prior year by million due to growth in several services 
renewal revenue for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses remained flat due to cost containment efforts 
healthcare group revenues were slightly lower for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
healthcare s performance was strong and the healthcare environment was challenging especially for revenues in the areas of labor services  rank and file compensation  and physician services 
for the year ended december   commission and general and administrative expenses include approximately thousand and thousand  respectively  for costs associated with a severance agreement 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   included one time charges of thousand for write off of leasehold improvements from a previous office space and severance associated with the downsizing of existing staff levels 
pearl meyer partners operating results year ended december  total revenue    operating expenses    operating income loss   of revenue as of october   we transferred part of the operations of the human capital practice to pearl meyer partners

in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice including the rewards and performance group were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice

debt to total capitalization includes restricted cash and current portion of debt associated with asset backed notes 
total stockholders equity divided by actual shares outstanding at year end 
current debt plus long term debt divided by current debt plus long term debt plus stockholders equity in addition to our tangible balance sheet assets and liabilities  we have an on going non securitized renewal revenue stream  estimated to be million  on a gross basis  over the next ten years 
this on going renewal revenue stream reflects current conditions and is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that may actually be achieved in the future and we cannot assure you that commissions under these policies will be received 
see estimated future gross renewal revenue section in the next few pages 
based on our historically strong operating cash flow and revolving credit facility  we believe we have little need to maintain substantial cash balances 
we use net cash from operating activities primarily to fund capital expenditures  small acquisitions  and service existing debt 
we expect large cash outlays and future acquisitions will be financed primarily through externally available funds 
however  we can offer no assurance such funds will be available and  if so  on terms acceptable to us 
year ended december  cash flows from used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    cash flows from operating activities our cash flow from operating activities for the twelve months ended december    and were as follows year ended december  net income plus non cash expenses    changes in operating assets and liabilities    cash flow from operating activities    the non cash expenses mentioned above include depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements  amortization of intangibles  charges for performance based stock options issued to non employee producers  and deferred tax expense 
in the first quarter of  we wrote off approximately million of costs associated with a securitization financing that we are no longer pursuing 
cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities included a reduction of accounts receivable million  primarily as a result of improved collection efforts  and an increase in non current liabilities primarily as a result of increased contributions and earnings in our deferred compensation plans million 
estimated future gross renewal revenue the following tables represent the estimated gross renewal revenue associated with the business owned life insurance policies owned by our clients as of december  the projected gross revenues are not adjusted for mortality  lapse  or other factors that may impair realization  have not been discounted to reflect their net present value  and do not reflect the commission expense we must pay to consultants when we recognize the related revenue 
we cannot assure you that commissions under these policies will be received 
these projected gross revenues are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management and are not necessarily indicative of the revenue that may actually be realized in the future 
non securitized gross inforce revenues

executive banking healthcare benefits practice practice group total total december      total december      the year inforce revenues net of commission expense are million as of december   as compared to at december  securitized gross inforce revenues 
the following table represents the estimated gross renewal revenue associated with our securitized inforce bank owned life insurance policies as of december  these revenue streams are restricted for the specific purpose of paying off our asset backed notes which were issued in connection with the acquisition of longmiller in november banking practice total december   total december   the year inforce revenue net of commission expense is million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
pearl meyer partners  human capital practice  and federal policy group generate fee based revenues and do not produce inforce revenues 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   million of our cash was used for contingent consideration payments to prior owners of businesses we acquired and million of our cash was used for purchases of equipment 
a substantial portion of the purchase price used to fund acquisitions has historically been paid in cash 
this is primarily due to our desire to avoid diluting our existing stockholders 
we expect acquisitions to continue and be financed primarily from available credit lines and possible additional equity 
however  we can offer no assurances such will be the case 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   approximately million of cash was used primarily million for the net repayment of borrowings 
as of december   there was restricted cash of approximately million  a decrease of million from december   which will be used to pay down the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller 
this cash is not available for general corporate purposes  but is solely to service securitization indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of longmiller 
in may  we received proceeds of approximately million from our participation in a pooled trust preferred transaction  in which we issued million aggregate principal amount of long term subordinated debt securities with a floating rate based on three month libor plus a spread of basis points as of december  
we used the net proceeds to pay down the term portion of our credit facility 
the pooled trust preferred debt is payable in one payment due in years with interest paid quarterly 
in november  we amended and restated our december  credit agreement revising the amount available under the credit facility to million for a three year period ending december  in december  a new participant bank was added to the facility increasing the facility amount to million 
the credit facility amount was reduced dollar for dollar by million of repayments in and on the term portion of the facility 
we had million available under our credit line at december  our assets are pledged to the bank group as part of the credit facility except for cash flows from commissions to be received upon the renewals of specified inforce policies acquired in connection with the acquisition of longmiller 
in september  we amended our credit agreement to allow for potential stock repurchases and dividend payments 
the remaining provisions of the agreement remained substantively the same 
the restrictive covenants under the credit agreement provide for the maintenance of a minimum ratio of fixed charges  a maximum allowable leverage ratio  a minimum amount of net worth stockholders equity  and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  we believe that our cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide sufficient funds to service our debt obligations 
however  as our business grows  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will also continue to increase 
there can be no assurance that the net cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow requirements or that we will not require additional debt or equity financing in the future 
we may issue stock to finance future acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
set forth below is a summary presentation of our contractual obligations as of december   which are expected to become due and payable during the periods specified 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt obligations      operating lease obligations      contingent considerations for acquisitions    total      we expect to make significant cash outlays in future years for interest  taxes  and deferred compensation arrangements 
however  due to their variable nature  no amounts for these items have been included in the table above 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain of our expenses  such as compensation  benefits  and capital equipment costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
however  the majority of our service and administrative agreements with clients  which generate fee income  have a cost of living adjustment tied to the consumer price index 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had total outstanding indebtedness of million  or approximately of total market capitalization

on may   we entered into an interest rate swap with a total non amortizing notional value of million to hedge our libor based debt 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap entered into in january of amortizes at the rate of million per quarter 
the terms of the interest rate swaps are as follows notional amount effective at december  fixed rate variable rate fair value as of date maturity date to be paid to be received december  january  december   libor may  march   libor total we have exposure to changing interest rates and  as discussed in note  financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements  will engage in hedging activities  from time to time  to mitigate this risk 
the interest rate swaps  which we have entered into  are used to hedge our interest rate exposure on the libor based variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest on the remaining million of unhedged debt at december   bears interest at three month libor plus a weighted average of basis points 
at our current borrowing level  a change in the interest rate will have an effect of approximately thousand on interest expense on an annual basis
