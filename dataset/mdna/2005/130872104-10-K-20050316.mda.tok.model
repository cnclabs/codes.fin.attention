caliper is a leader in microfluidic lab on a chip technologies 
we believe our labchip systems add value to the life sciences industry by miniaturizing  integrating  automating and standardizing many laboratory processes  and by raising the quality and reproducibility of data derived by our customers 
in july  caliper acquired zymark corporation  a global provider of liquid handling  laboratory automation and robotics technology 
we believe that by combining our microfluidic technologies with advanced liquid handling capabilities  we are well positioned to develop and deliver next generation laboratory automation products that address the key challenges of modern scientific research 
caliper changed its name from caliper technologies corp 
to caliper life sciences  inc in january  and the zymark legal entity was merged into caliper in april within the life sciences industry  caliper is currently pursuing three major markets drug discovery and development  genomics and proteomics  and molecular diagnostics 
we believe that our products and technologies are capable of addressing these markets in a number of ways 
for example  in the drug discovery and development market  pharmaceutical companies face many new challenges 
these include late stage drug failures  increased research and development spending yielding fewer new drugs and  more recently  drugs being removed from the market due to unforeseen side effects that were not discovered in pre launch clinical trials 
caliper is focused on helping pharmaceutical companies address these challenges by providing products that help researchers make better choices earlier in their drug discovery process  increase the speed and efficiency of their high throughput screening efforts  and enable profiling experiments that can identify drug side effects earlier in the drug discovery process 
in the genomics and proteomics market  recent advances in dna research and a subsequent surge of interest in protein functionality has created an increased industry need for high throughput  cost efficient tools for dna and protein experiments 
products such as our 
table of contents labchip system for high throughput dna and protein analysis directly address this need by integrating and automating the multiple steps required by conventional gel electrophoresis experiments 
molecular diagnostics  another significant scientific frontier that has evolved from the genomics revolution  holds enormous potential to impact human health through earlier detection of disease 
however  existing molecular diagnostic tests tend to be complex and expensive  limiting their acceptance by health care organizations already burdened by high costs 
we believe that our labchip technologies may help address these cost issues through integration and miniaturization of the various steps required to carry out these tests 
we have three channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  and through original equipment manufacturer oem channels 
through our direct and indirect distributor channels  we sell complete systems solutions developed by caliper to end customers 
our oem distribution channel is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
in the oem channel we provide liquid handling products  microfluidics chips  product development expertise and other enabling technologies to commercial partners who then typically integrate an application solution and market it to their end customers 
in addition to these product distribution channels  caliper has begun to out license its extensive microfluidic patent estate for applications for which it does not have current product development plans  or which caliper cannot access because of the licensee s proprietary technology 
by using direct and indirect distribution  and oem product distribution channels  as well as out licensing our technology in appropriate circumstances  caliper seeks to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position itself as a leader in the life sciences tools market

technologies labchip microfluidic technologies we have developed our labchip microfluidic technology to provide significant advances in laboratory experimentation for the pharmaceutical and other industries 
microfluidic chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include a labchip instrument and experiment specific reagents and software 
our chips contain a network of miniaturized  microfabricated channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved to perform experiments 
a single type of chip  used with customized reagents and software to perform a particular experiment  comprises one labchip application 
depending on the chip format  reagents are introduced either automatically or by the user 
the instrument and software control the movement of fluids via pressure or voltage  and an integrated optical system detects the results of the particular experiment 
because we have great flexibility in channel design  and can exert split second computer control over fluid flow  we have the ability to create chips for numerous applications 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and 
table of contents automate experiments with the goal of providing the benefits of improved data accuracy and reproducibility  reduced cost and higher speed  leading to expanded individual researcher capability and improved enterprise wide productivity 
features of labchip systems miniaturization 
conventional laboratory equipment typically uses at least a drop of fluid  or to microliters  to perform each experiment 
in many labchip applications  the sample volume needed from external sources is reduced to below nanoliter  a reduction of up to  fold over conventional systems 
in some processes within the chip  reagents are dispensed in the microchannels in volumes down to tens of picoliters  another fold reduction  which speeds analysis times and increases sample throughput 
a microliter is one millionth of a liter  a nanoliter is one billionth of a liter  and a picoliter is one trillionth of a liter 
integration 
integration is the combining of multiple processes into a single process  or the inclusion of multiple functions into one device 
today many laboratory systems perform only one or two steps of an experimental protocol 
our labchip systems can integrate complete experiments involving half a dozen or more steps into one continuous process performed on a single chip 
automation 
many laboratory experiments are performed in multiple manual steps 
with our labchip systems  entire experiments can be automated and performed inside a chip using one instrument  freeing up valuable research time and laboratory space and reducing labor requirements 
key benefits of labchip systems improved data quality and accuracy 
our labchip systems are designed to produce more accurate  consistent and reproducible data by reducing human error  reducing the variability caused by the use of multiple instruments  and enabling more analytical approaches to experimentation that are impractical in traditional systems 
for example  biochemical screening assays typically call for fast  bulk measurements of an experimental mixture 
reducing the size of the experiment allows for rapid separation and measurement of individual molecular species in the test mixture  which in turn enhances the accuracy of the overall result 
with higher quality data  our customers can make better decisions earlier in the drug discovery and development process 
this enables our customers to avoid the time and expense of performing additional analyses and experiments on false positive results from their primary screening experiments 
improved sensitivity 
when screening against drug targets  such as kinases  the higher quality data from our labchip systems allows customers to detect lower levels of inhibition than can be detected with traditional microplate well based assays 
this has two advantages an increase in the pool of potential lead compounds  and the possibility that a hit found at lower levels of inhibition will be more selective for the target of interest than a hit found at higher levels of inhibition because compounds that hit at higher levels of inhibition may also produce unacceptable levels of inhibition on other  non target kinases 
reduced reagent and labor cost 
our labchip systems utilize only a small fraction of the usual amount of expensive reagents used in experiments performed in test tubes  well plates  or well plates  and also reduce the labor involved in each experiment 
we believe that saving on reagent cost and labor can enable pharmaceutical companies to expand the scale of experimentation in ways that would otherwise not be commercially feasible 
high speed 
we believe our labchip systems can  depending on the application  accelerate some experiments as much as fold or more 
for example  molecular separations such as electrophoresis may take two hours or more using conventional equipment 
on a chip  however  we can perform these separations in less than one minute 
faster assay development 
traditional assays  particularly those used for enzymatic screening  can require complex and time consuming assay development 
for example  some popular assays rely on 
table of contents developing specific antibodies for the assay a process that can take up to six weeks or more 
because they eliminate the requirement for assay development steps such as antibody preparation  labchip assays are much faster to develop 
in addition  caliper has exploited the predictable nature of fluid and reagent movement inside microfluidic channels and has developed software tools to facilitate the process of optimizing the experimental conditions necessary for a successful enzymatic assay on a labchip device  such as separating a substrate peptide from its product 
typically  our customers have found that these combined benefits translate into a two to three month assay development process for a traditional assay being shortened to just a few weeks for a labchip assay 
expanded individual researcher capability 
because our labchip systems can combine a multi step  complex experiment into one step  we believe that individual researchers can perform experiments previously outside their areas of expertise 
by comparison  with conventional  non integrated equipment  researchers need to master the complexities of performing each individual step 
improved enterprise wide productivity 
we believe our labchip systems can improve data quality and reproducibility to the point where researchers can utilize data generated outside their laboratory or organization 
this has the potential to greatly improve enterprise wide productivity by supporting data sharing and reducing the need to repeat experiments 
for example  a typical primary screen produces approximate  yes no answers about the activity of library compounds against a particular kinase target  and therefore the information from such primary screens is only useful for one primary screening experiment 
with labchip assays  the primary screening data is more specific  in terms of the degree of inhibition  and more reproducible 
this should enable an organization to build a database of primary screening data that could ultimately be mined by other scientists within the organization interested in a particular compound target interaction 
not all laboratory processes  however  are ideally suited to be performed using our labchip systems 
for example  detecting clinically important materials that appear in low concentrations in a sample  such as the virus that causes aids  is not always practical with our microfluidic labchip systems 
this is because there is a risk that the virus will not be present in the very small sample volumes used by our chips 
as a result  in certain applications use of our labchip microfluidic system may require the pre processing of a sample to increase concentration 
furthermore  if the analysis of a sample must involve even one process that cannot currently be performed in the labchip system  then use of the system for the parts it can perform is often impractical 
this is because the very small scale of the chip experiment does not generally produce enough material to be analyzed by conventional laboratory equipment 
liquid handling and automation technologies our advanced liquid handling and laboratory automation expertise has resulted in a portfolio of proprietary technologies that are used for precision liquid handling  microplate management  and pharmaceutical development and quality control 
our liquid handling systems provide fast and accurate liquid transfers and plate reformatting for multiple microplate formats 
our systems are characterized by their open and modular design that addresses a wide range of applications

in the development function  our workstations can improve speed to market with efficient method development  process scale up  validation  and stability programs 
in the qa laboratory  inventory cycle time is reduced and documentation is improved 
in any department  analysts are freed to contribute to more value added responsibilities 
precise  technique independent results ensure smooth method transfer to other 
table of contents laboratories 
our pdq workstations meet the rigorous regulatory requirements of the food and drug administration fda  united states pharmacopeia usp and other regulatory bodies 
products and services our portfolio of products includes high and ultra high throughput screening systems  automated electrophoresis systems  liquid handlers  advanced robotics  storage devices  dissolution  extraction and evaporation workstations  and easy to use software that controls scheduling  integration and data management 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of revenue from services and aftermarket products  including consumable and accessory products such as labchip devices  pipette tips  filters  glassware and storage trays 
high throughput screening systems and integrated workstations labchip drug discovery system 
the labchip system is our next generation microfluidic system for the drug discovery market 
a replacement for the caliper  the initial microfluidics screening system launched in september  the labchip represents a significant advance over the caliper in terms of industrial design  functional reliability and reduced cost 
a completely new commercial design reduces the overall size of the platform to approximately one third that of its predecessor 
we reduced manufacturing costs to achieve acceptable profit margins for the product while also allowing for a lower price to the end user 
using proprietary sipper chips to automatically sample library compounds from or well plates  the labchip performs unattended  high volume screening  producing high quality data that minimizes false positives and false negatives and detects weak inhibitors with high accuracy  potentially identifying drug candidates that conventional techniques can miss 
each chip has either or sippers  small glass capillary tubes attached to the chip 
once the researcher prepares the chip and places it into a labchip system  minute quantities of sample can be introduced  or sipped  through the capillary tube onto the chip 
this sipping process can be repeated many times with different compounds  enabling a single chip to analyze thousands of samples quickly and without human intervention 
assays are available for the labchip system for enzymatic drug targets such as kinases  proteases phosphatases  and lipid modifying enzymes  and cell based targets such as g protein coupled receptors gpcrs 
new capabilities allow screening against both adherent and non adherent cell types  and the small volumes of cells required enable screening against cells that are in short supply  eg  primary cells 
we have identified compound selectivity screening  especially for kinases  as an emerging opportunity within the drug discovery market 
a typical kinase drug development program will focus on finding lead compounds that inhibit a particular kinase thought to play a role in the disease being studied 
as scientists learn more about the human kinome  the newly coined word for the different kinases found in the human body  they also are becoming increasingly concerned about the interactions of lead compounds on other kinases  and the potential adverse side effects resulting from these interactions 
as a result  selectivity or profiling screens  where lead compounds are screened against a representative group of human kinases  are increasingly becoming a routine part of drug discovery programs 
our labchip system has the ability to generate the highest quality data for this kind of experimentation 
in addition  the system is a fast  cost effective way to generate numerous assays to meet the evolving requirements of pharmaceutical companies specific profiling strategies 
in  some of our newer profiling customers also requested that caliper provide assay development services to them  and we view this as an emerging business opportunity

separations and analysis labchip automated electrophoresis system 
our labchip automated electrophoresis system  formerly marketed under the name ams se  automates the sizing and concentration analysis of proteins and dna fragments  and is designed to meet the needs of higher throughput research and production laboratories that presently use sds page and agarose gel electrophoresis 
using our proprietary microfluidic sipper chips to introduce samples directly from well or well plates  the labchip provides walk away automation  reduced analysis time  and immediate reporting of high quality sizing and concentration data 
for dna and protein separations  the labchip provides an automated  higher throughput alternative to the agilent bioanalyzer and bio rad experion systems  each of which are discussed further below under the caption  key corporate partnerships 
automated electrophoresis is still in its relatively early stages of market adoption 
however  as scientists identify needs for higher throughput research  we believe they will find the throughput  data quality and reporting capabilities of the labchip system attractive 
in response to the slow initial market reaction  we modified the software of the labchip system to make the instrument more compatible with the workflow requirements of a typical laboratory  and introduced a new faster and more sensitive protein assay  the protein express assay 
we have also focused our marketing activities to better position labchip and support sales related activities in order to convert opportunities into new sales 
despite these developments  we believe that market adoption for labchip will continue at an improved  but still relatively slow  pace in pharmaceutical development and quality control multidose g the multidose g is a fully automated dissolution testing system that works within an open architecture  allowing the use of industry standard accessories

table of contents equipment 
agilent provides enabling solutions to markets within the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
until we terminated our collaboration agreement with agilent  which termination was effective in may  agilent and caliper collaborated to create and distribute commercial research products based on caliper s microfluidic labchip technologies 
the relationship effectively combined agilent s expertise in the life sciences marketplace with caliper s microfluidic innovation to bring novel products to market 
through its partnership with caliper  agilent introduced the bioanalyzer system in september  and the agilent lab on a chip instrument system in the fall of although the termination of our collaboration agreement with agilent was effective in may  we continue to manufacture and supply labchip products to agilent under the termination provisions of the collaboration agreement 
agilent bioanalyzer 
the first instrument platform to be introduced for labchip applications  the agilent bioanalyzer is a desktop instrument designed to perform a wide range of everyday scientific applications using a menu of different labchip kits 
the bioanalyzer uses our planar chips  in which the researcher pipettes chemical reagents into the reservoirs of the chip  including the various samples to be tested  before placing the labchip into the instrument 
the chips and labchip kits are manufactured and supplied by caliper to agilent  and agilent manufactures and distributes the bioanalyzer instrument under a license from us 
agilent launched the bioanalyzer in september  and agilent and caliper have continued to expand the menu of applications capable of being run on this instrument 
current applications include dna  rna and protein sizing and concentration analysis  and cell analysis 
the bioanalyzer integrates several experimental steps into one  reducing analysis time from hours to minutes 
other benefits of the system include significantly reduced sample consumption and higher quality data than conventional slab gel electrophoresis experiments 
under our ongoing supply arrangements for the bioanalyzer  agilent purchases chips and reagents at a price which reimburses us for our costs of manufacturing these products and pays us a share of the gross margin realized by agilent on sales of all components of the bioanalyzer system  including instruments 
we recognize revenue related to the reimbursement of costs for the supply of chips and reagents to agilent upon shipment  and we recognize the related costs as components of the cost of sales 
we recognize as revenue our share of gross margin on components of the bioanalyzer systems sold by agilent upon shipment to the end user 
our gross margin share varies depending on the type of collaboration product  and on whether agilent or caliper manufactures the collaboration product 
under the supply agreement terms  our gross margin share for chips  reagents and instruments decreased in november  and will decrease again in may agilent lab on a chip alp instrument

table of contents customers our current customers include many of the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as oem providers of complementary life science solutions 
approximately  and of our total revenues for  and  respectively  were derived from customers in the united states 
see note to our financial statements located at the end of this annual report for revenues from customers and long lived assets attributable to geographic areas outside of the united states 
during  agilent accounted for approximately of our total revenue and of our product revenue 
no other customer exceeded of our revenue in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we typically experience higher revenues in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of capital spending patterns of our customers 
backlog for a portion of our sales  we manufacture products based on our forecast of customer demand and maintain inventories in advance of receipt of purchase orders 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in the same quarter  shipments from our backlog of orders from previous quarters  and recognition of revenues that had been previously recorded as deferred revenue pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
our products are typically shipped within ninety days of purchase order receipt 
as a result  we do not believe that the amount of backlog at any particular date is indicative of our future level of sales in any succeeding quarter 
the level of backlog at december  was million  and at december  was million 
in our backlog  we include only the total value of open purchase orders for products and services that management has concluded have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve month period 
this amount specifically excludes deferred revenue  and products and services to be provided in the future pursuant to terms of contractual agreements for which we have not yet received purchase orders 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all product sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for products to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility into future product shipments  and our results of operations are subject to variability from quarter to quarter 
research and development we have made substantial investments in lab on a chip research since our inception  and believe that we have established a leading position in lab on a chip technology 
we explored fundamental issues of lab on a chip technology as early as possible in order to find solutions to important technical challenges 
where our developed technology shows commercial promise  we have sought patent protection for our solutions 
we intend to combine developing new versions of our microfluidics based drug discovery systems with enhanced features that address existing or emerging customer needs  such as offering a broad range of standardized  easy to use assays 
with the realignment of caliper following our acquisition of zymark  we have made some important changes to our approach to research and development which have resulted in a substantial decrease in our research and development expenses 
first  we are now emphasizing what we refer to as a sequential  rather than parallel  approach to our r d projects  meaning that we now undertake r d projects in a more methodical manner  rather than pursuing all of our projects at the same time 
in doing this  we are prioritizing those projects that we believe have the greatest potential commercial value 
second  we are now emphasizing a shared investment risk approach to r d in which we have our customers or potential customers share in the expense of an r d project 
in  customer funding  which we include in our contract revenues  was approximately of our research and development expense 
this percentage could vary significantly in a given year based on our ability to obtain customer funding 
nonetheless  we believe that this shared investment risk model is important not only because it offsets at least a portion of our r d expense  but also because it provides important customer validation that a particular r d project has potential commercial 
table of contents value 
through these measures  we have been able to reduce our research and development expenses and utilize our resources more efficiently 
today we have ongoing core technology research and applied product development efforts in several areas technology research our technology research activities fall into several classes 
chip design 
we are increasing our understanding of the design rules guiding the development of new microfluidic chips 
using the principles of engineering  we create patterns of interconnected channels that permit execution of the various common steps of experimentation 
for example  we have designed and implemented rapid thermal control methods on chips for applications requiring precise temperature control and fast cycling 
designs from one chip can be used for other chips needing similar fluidic functions for a different application 
mathematics and computer models also help minimize the number of iterations necessary to achieve new functional chip designs 
chip manufacturing 
we continue to seek ways to improve the yield and decrease the cost of manufacturing our chips 
we are exploring novel fabrication techniques and the use of new materials that offer functional advantages  such as superior optical features or lower manufacturing costs 
we have development programs exploring manufacturing technology for chips made of plastic 
plastic devices potentially offer cost advantages and can offer favorable surface chemical and design features for some applications 
one area of continuous improvement is micromachining technology for precisely attaching capillaries to our sipper chips to access reagents 
in automated experimentation  the number of capillaries and channels running in parallel determines the level of throughput 
accordingly  we have developed high yield fabrication methods to enable us to cost effectively manufacture chips with many capillaries 
another important area of development is surface chemistry  in particular  controlling the reproducibility of channel surface characteristics in our labchip products 
instrument manufacturing and software design 
we use the skills of electrical engineers  optical engineers  mechanical engineers  product designers and software engineers to create new instruments and software 
the instruments are designed to optimize liquid handling and automation of life science laboratory applications  or to control fluid movement  temperature control  and detection functionality for our microfluidic chips 
software engineers write computer programs to manage tasks such as controlling chip functionality  collecting data  communicating between different instrument modules and communicating between caliper s and other manufacturer s instruments 
currently  our instrument research and development efforts are focused on the miniaturization of fluidics  robotics for target preparation and handling of microarray chips  the development of modular microfluidic instrument components that can be combined with other types of instruments and liquid handling equipment  depending on the desired application  high efficiency liquid handling workstations  the development of software to promote integration capability  and continued development of productivity workstations for genomics and biotech 
systems integration 
when developing commercial products  we seek to incorporate features that are necessary to perform a specific experiment  and configure the assay so that it offers tangible benefits to users 
by carefully characterizing the problem  as well as the solution  we are able to define precise product specifications 
for instance  in each microfluidics application  we determine how to manipulate flow conditions and how to control surface interactions in order to create novel functions and or suppress undesirable effects 
the resulting complete solution includes the labchip device  the instrument interface  computer software and reagents 

table of contents applications development we have developed expertise in discovering new functions that microfluidic chips can perform 
we generate computer models of how an experiment can be carried out  store these functional designs  and can incorporate them into new designs that simulate complete experimental pathways 
in this way  we believe the value of new microfluidic inventions can be rapidly expanded across many application development projects 
drug discovery is one application area that has benefited greatly from microfluidics 
higher data quality allows less potent inhibitors to be discovered using our labchip platform 
a current area of focus is kinase selectivity screening 
the labchip system can be used to understand how candidate drug compounds react with a particular kinase drug target relative to other kinase molecules in the human body  with potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the resultant drug 
we have developed more than kinase assays that can be provided to the customer to facilitate implementation of their kinase selectivity screening programs 
another important application is cell based screening against g protein coupled receptor gpcr targets 
we have developed a control mechanism to keep suspension as well as adherent cells stable on chip for many hours to facilitate use of the labchip with the widest variety of cells 
due to the greatly reduced consumption of cells and reagents  this application is well suited for screening of primary cells  which are believed to be more physiologically relevant to drug discovery 
another application focus area is tools to improve proteomics and genomics research 
the recently introduced high speed protein separation assay for our labchip platform increases productivity in protein expression  protein purification  and antibody engineering laboratories 
with this application  we achieve automated sampling of protein samples from microplates using sipper chips  and the digital data output can be easily manipulated and analyzed to greatly reduce the time to answer 
we have also increased our application focus on our more traditional macrofluidic automation products  such as liquid handling  plate handling  and complete automation systems 
our applications group works closely with key customers to understand their critical application needs 
these needs are then addressed directly by developing specific automation configurations and software specified methods that are optimized for key applications such as cell based assays  nucleic acid purification  and mass spectrometry sample preparation 
for example  our staccato platform has been configured specifically for cell based assays and is now marketed as a standard application system 
product development our product development efforts are currently focused on new applications and capabilities for our existing instruments and the development of new instrument platforms 
extensions of existing product lines 
for our labchip instrument systems  we are expanding the menu of applications to include assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
for the labchip high throughput screening system for drug discovery  our recently introduced applications include calcium flux assays for adherent cells 
the system improvements incorporated for this application also enhance the throughput of suspension cells and make the system well suited for primary cell screening 
for the labchip automated electrophoresis system  we recently announced a new application and labchip device for higher throughput protein separations 
the protein express assay provides faster analysis  higher sensitivity  and enhanced ease of use 
extensions to our liquid handling and automation product lines are ongoing 
these include the development of additional application based staccato systems and the further development of our liquid handling automation to include positive pressure filtration and low volume disposable tip capability  as well as enhance nanoliter dispensing and feedback control capability 
we are also developing extensions of certain existing products to address applications of high interest to our partners  such as the automation of target preparation for affymetrix commercialized proprietary microarray system 
polymerase chain reaction on a chip 
our pcr on a chip technology has potential utility for a variety of molecular diagnostic applications  including pharmacogenomics and early detection and screening for a variety of cancers and infections 
we are developing an integrated application that is designed to perform the 
table of contents required steps of reagent assembly  amplification and readout in rapid  serial fashion inside the channels of a microfluidic chip 
we believe that our technology will offer the advantages of nanoliter scale processing of valuable reagents  automated reagent assembly  and computer controlled heating and mixing for high quality data production 
though our nanoliter scale system is still in development  our prototype instrument is capable of performing a large number of nanoliter reactions with starting material down to single copies of genomic dna 
compared to conventional methods  which can take between minutes to two hours to complete  we can do a complete amplification and detection reaction in about nine minutes 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to decrease in the future to the extent our revenues grow and as we slow the pace of discretionary spending on research programs by focusing on those opportunities with maximum commercial viability and sharing the funding of r d programs with other partners 
manufacturing effective in november  we consolidated all instrument manufacturing in our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing facility  which is iso compliant 
iso  the international standards organization  sets international standards for quality in product design  manufacturing and distribution 
we manufacture some subassemblies ourselves and other components are made to our specifications by outside vendors 
to ensure the quality and on time delivery of parts and subassemblies  we track our top suppliers and score them on a monthly basis 
the subassemblies are inspected and tested before being placed into final product assemblies 
production cycle times range from several hours to five days for more complex workstations 
systems and workstations are produced from components based on a wide variety of proprietary technologies  including intricate mechanical actuators  precision fluid handling systems  computers and software 
we produce systems by combining certain of our products with third party vendor equipment  primarily detection instrumentation 
the systems are a combination of standard components  assembled in either standard or custom configurations to meet a customer s specific needs 
a typical production cycle ranges from to days from receipt of order to shipment of a system 
the final products are then put through an extensive testing cycle before being released for shipment 
testing at our factory and or the customer s site establishes that the system is performing to the customer s specifications 
we manufacture all of our chips in a class clean room facility in mountain view  california 
caliper is iso compliant for the development  manufacture and distribution of its chips and reagents 
we contract with third parties to supply raw materials  component parts and sub assemblies used in our chips and reagents kits 
we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure for the manufacture and distribution of our chips while reviewing outsourcing options for manufacturing our products at a lower cost 
for a discussion of the methods we use to manufacture our chips see technology and research and development 
suppliers we obtain key components of our chips  instruments and reagent based products from a number of suppliers  including  in certain cases  single source or limited source suppliers 
a third party supplies us with its proprietary dyes  which are used in many of our labchip products 
furthermore  we depend on a foreign single source supplier for the manufacture of glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of our chips 
the majority of key components for our chip and instrument products are available on short lead time from our suppliers 
the only component requiring any significant lead time to acquire is our proprietary glass stock  as our supplier requires a minimum order to cover an entire production run 
we anticipate that inventories of this proprietary material  at current production levels  will be sufficient for the next months 
although we have established licensing arrangements and supply agreements with most of our suppliers  there can be no assurances that these companies could not in some way be adversely affected in the future and 
table of contents be unable to meet our critical supply needs 
if the supply of components from these suppliers were interrupted  we might not be able to manufacture our products at all or in a timely fashion  which would disrupt our delivery of products to our customers 
competition in general  markets for instruments designed for life sciences applications are very competitive  and we believe these markets will remain competitive in the future 
the competition we face in these markets not only arises from other companies selling instruments that are directly competitive with our instruments  but also from companies selling other types of instruments who are competing for the same  scarce funds in a potential customer s capital budget 
we encounter competition from a number of life science tools companies  especially in the areas of liquid handling  separations analysis  and high throughput screening 
in particular  we anticipate that our competition will come primarily from companies providing competitive liquid handling  automation products and integration services for applications similar to ours 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are productivity enhancement  breadth of applications  accuracy  ease of use  price versus performance  product reliability and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including tecan  beckman coulter  velocity  applied biosystems division of applera  and perkinelmer 
companies supplying conventional technologies for gel electrophoresis separations for proteins  dna and rna 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per sample analyzed  throughput and productivity enhancement  data quality  ease of use  and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including agilent  bio rad laboratories  and beckman coulter 
companies supplying products for high throughput screening for the discovery of new drug compounds 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per compound analyzed  throughput  data quality  ease of use  and reliability and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including ge healthcare  molecular devices  perkinelmer  and tecan 
we believe our products compete favorably with respect to all of these factors in each of these markets 
however  in markets where we sell products based on our labchip technology  we not only need to demonstrate the advantages of our products over competing technologies and products  but we must also often overcome a customer s resistance to switching from a well established  familiar technology to a fundamentally new technology 
we also need to compete effectively with companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies and products  such as fluidigm  gyros  micronics  tecan  biotrove  microfluidic systems  nanostream  m  applied biosystems  and cepheid 
microfluidic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in these and future technologies  which we may not be able to do 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
there is the possibility that we may experience increased competition from agilent in the future 
for example  our labchip automated electrophoresis system provides many of the same capabilities as the agilent system launched by agilent in we terminated our collaboration agreement with agilent effective in may  and under the surviving terms of the agreement  agilent has a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies 
under the terms of this license  agilent is able to develop  make and sell labchip devices in the field of our collaboration with agilent 

table of contents in many instances  particularly with respect to our liquid handling and automation products  our competitors have or may have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we do 
our competitors also generally have greater name recognition than we do  and may offer more favorable pricing as a competitive tactic 
in addition  given the larger scale of their operations  most of our competitors spend more on research and development than we do 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products  or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
intellectual property we seek patent protection for our lab on a chip technologies 
as of december   we owned or held licenses to over issued us patents and approximately pending us patent applications  some of which derive from a common parent application 
the issued us patents expire between and foreign counterparts of many of these patents and applications have been filed and or issued in one or more other countries  resulting in a total of more than issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries 
these patents and applications are directed to various technological areas which we believe are valuable to our business  including control of movement of fluid and other material through interconnected microchannels  continuous flow  high throughput screening assay methods and systems  analytical and control instrumentation  analytical system architecture  automated liquid handling systems  chip based assay chemistries and methods  chip compatible sample accession  software for control of microfluidic based systems and data analysis  and chip manufacturing processes 
we also rely upon copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our lab on a chip technology 
we are party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties which give us rights to use certain technologies 
for example  we have licenses in the fields we are currently operating in from ut battelle  llc  relating to patents covering inventions by dr 
j 
michael ramsey  and from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania covering microfluidic applications and chip structures 
these licenses extend for the duration of the life of the licensed patents 
a failure to maintain some or all of the rights to these technologies could seriously harm our business 
environmental matters we continuously assess the compliance of our operations with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
our policy is to record liabilities for environmental matters when loss amounts are probable and reasonably determinable 
our manufacturing sites utilize chemicals and other potentially hazardous materials and generates both hazardous and non hazardous waste  the transportation  
table of contents treatment  storage and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
when needed  we have engaged environmental consultants to assist with our compliance efforts 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental permits and are aware of our responsibilities under applicable environmental laws 
any expenditures necessitated by changes in law and permitting requirements cannot be predicted at this time  although we do not expect such costs to be material to our financial position  results of operations or competitive position 
other business risks in addition to the risks to our business associated with suppliers  competition and intellectual property discussed above  our business is subject to a number of other significant risks  including the risks that our labchip products may not achieve wide market acceptance  and we may not be successful in developing new and enhanced liquid handling products 
these and other risks that may cause our actual results  financial performance or achievements to be materially different from our present expectations are discussed in more detail below under factors affecting operating results contained in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which discussion is incorporated by reference here

the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
overview caliper uses its core technologies of liquid handling  automation  and labchip microfluidics to create enabling solutions for the life sciences industry 
caliper is a leader in microfluidic lab on a chip technologies 
we believe our labchip systems can add value to the life sciences industry by miniaturizing  integrating  automating and standardizing many laboratory processes  and by raising the quality of data derived from experimentation 
in july   caliper acquired zymark corporation  a global provider of liquid handling  laboratory automation and robotics technologies 
we believe that by combining our microfluidic technologies with advanced liquid handling capabilities we are well positioned to develop and deliver next generation laboratory automation products that address the key challenges of modern scientific research 
within the life sciences industry  we compete in certain application segments of the drug discovery and drug development  and genomics and proteomics markets  and currently estimate our addressable market size at approximately billion 
we see future attractiveness in the molecular diagnostics market  which holds enormous potential to impact human health through earlier detection of disease 
the overall market potential for our products increases to the extent that we are able to access new markets through our partnerships and technology licensing arrangements with companies such as agilent  affymetrix  amphora  bio rad  predicant  and wako 
performance our million of revenue in was consistent with our previous estimates 
revenue growth was principally the result of having the benefit of a full year of sales from zymark products and services in revenue from products and services  totaled million  or of total revenue 
we believe that product and service revenue provides more stability for the growth of caliper in comparison to less predictable license and contract revenues 
our sg a and r d expenses of million were lower than our initial projections for the year 
we were able to achieve better than expected efficiencies as a result of our new commercial philosophy toward r d investments 
this  in turn  enabled us to further reduce costs in r d and enabled us to complete the closure of a second building in our mountain view  california facilities 
we ended with million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash and believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs  at least through the end of the markets for life science research tools and products have experienced modest growth of over the last several years due to a reduced rate of increase in research funding and capital spending cutbacks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology research markets 
we believe that we have the potential to grow faster than the overall market through increased adoption of our labchip technologies  increased chip sales as new instruments in our oem partnership channel gain traction  and increased sales of the caliper sciclone liquid handler and related integrated platforms 

table of contents labchip product adoption 
in  we saw increased adoption of the labchip and we ended the year with of the top pharmaceutical companies worldwide using our labchip screening systems  including such prominent companies as merck  pfizer  j j  novartis  sanofi aventis  lilly  wyeth  takeda  taisho  serono  amgen and millenium 
we consider the adoption process for our labchip screening systems to consist of three phases phase i  in which customers purchase their first unit and evaluate its performance versus traditional technologies  phase ii  in which customers have purchased additional labchip instruments for their other labs or have purchased additional instruments for their original lab  and phase iii  which is characterized by enterprise wide adoption of our labchip system 
we currently have customers in phases i and ii and one customer  amphora discovery corp  in phase iii 
one of our principal business strategies for is to drive our existing labchip customers to higher levels of adoption of these products 
during the past year  we have identified compound selectivity screening  especially for kinases  as an emerging opportunity within the drug discovery market 
a typical kinase drug development program will focus on finding lead compounds that inhibit a particular kinase thought to play a role in the disease being studied 
as scientists learn more about the human kinome  the newly coined word for the different kinases found in the human body  they also are becoming increasingly concerned about the interactions of lead compounds on other kinases  and the potential adverse side effects resulting from these interactions 
as a result  selectivity or profiling screens  where lead compounds are screened against a representative group of human kinases  are increasingly becoming a routine part of drug discovery programs 
our labchip system has the ability to generate the highest quality data for this kind of experimentation 
in addition  the system is a fast  cost effective way to generate numerous assays to meet the evolving requirements of pharmaceutical companies specific profiling strategies 
in  some of our newer profiling customers also requested that caliper provide assay development services to them  and we view this as an emerging business opportunity 
labchip product adoption 
we introduced the labchip automated electrophoresis system in february  as an updated version of the former ams system 
during  market adoption of the labchip system was slower than anticipated 
automated electrophoresis is still in its relatively early stages of market adoption 
however  as scientists identify needs for higher throughput research  we believe they will find the throughput  data quality and reporting capabilities of the labchip system attractive 
in response to the slow initial market reaction  we modified the software of the labchip system to make the instrument more compatible with the workflow requirements of a typical laboratory  and introduced a new faster and more sensitive protein assay  the protein express assay 
we have also focused our marketing activities to better position labchip and support sales related activities in order to convert opportunities into new sales 
despite these developments  we believe that market adoption for labchip will continue at an improved  but still relatively slow  pace in chip sales from oem products 
agilent launched the bioanalyzer system for dna  rna and protein analysis in since then  agilent has shipped over three thousand bioanalyzer instruments  which are manufactured by agilent under license from caliper  and more than million associated chips  all of which were manufactured by caliper 
in the fall of  agilent launched the lab on a chip alp platform  which is a higher throughput  automated platform for separations and analysis 
we are presently providing agilent with the sipper chips that run on this platform  and expect revenue from the sales of these chips to increase to the extent that this product gains traction 
in  our revenues from agilent were million  or approximately of our total revenue 
this revenue came from our sales of chips to agilent  including the sale of sipper chips for the agilent instrument system  as well as from royalties that we receive from our gross margin sharing arrangement 
there is the possibility that agilent could decide to manufacture its own supply of chips  which could adversely impact our revenues  and to a lesser extent our net income 
were this to occur  caliper would continue to receive ongoing royalties on agilent s product sales and  potentially  revenue from the sale of chips and labchip kits directly to the end users of the bioanalyzer and instrument platforms 
in the fall of  bio rad launched the experion automated electrophoresis system  which performs electrophoretic separation and analysis of protein and rna samples 
experion is the first product to come out of our collaboration with bio rad  which began in june under this oem arrangement  caliper is the 
table of contents exclusive supplier of labchip devices to bio rad and we receive a royalty on sales of instruments and software by bio rad 
caliper sciclone liquid handling sales 
in  we entered into a new oem partnership with affymetrix in which we provide automated target preparation instruments for affymetrix commercialized proprietary microarray system 
the first product of our partnership with affymetrix  the genechip array system gcas  is based on the caliper sciclone alh liquid handler 
this new product was released to early access customers in the fourth quarter of we are expecting our liquid handling product sales to increase in as a result of this collaboration  and as a result of feature and performance enhancements that we believe give us a competitive advantage for direct channel sales of the caliper sciclone liquid handler and related staccato system products 
key issues for future performance in order to continue to grow our business  reach profitability  gain market share and remain competitive we will need to address the following ongoing issues revenues we must grow revenues significantly to meet the company s goal of reaching positive cash flow from operations 
improvement in gross margins we need to improve our gross margins by increasing volume  especially in the area of chip production  to increase capacity utilization  and by achieving a larger proportion of our sales from higher margin products such as consumable products and services 
cost control it is essential for us to continue to control costs in order to allow us to reach operating cash flow break even 
we may consider other actions to further control costs  and we may also evaluate suitable acquisition candidates over the next several years to help us address the above issues 
we continue to face risks and uncertainties that could challenge our efforts to grow revenue  gain market share and remain competitive 
our microfluidic technologies still require significant development investment  and our drug discovery systems incorporating these technologies have only recently begun to be used commercially 
if our drug discovery systems do not gain further market acceptance  we will be unable to generate significant sales of these products and our revenue may decline 
the commercial success of our drug discovery systems will depend upon capital spending by our potential customers  and market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
to increase the likelihood that our microfluidic technologies gain market acceptance  a core element of our business strategy is to broaden our network of commercial oem partners in order to access new applications and new markets 
we believe that this will allow us to more effectively leverage the commercial potential of microfluidics in ways that would be difficult to achieve  from both a research investment and infrastructure perspective 
this strategy allows us to combine our proprietary technical expertise with partners who have complementary capabilities 
these types of collaborations diminish our risk and reduce our costs while leveraging larger  established partners strengths to tap markets that are new to caliper 
as we create new relationships of this type  we expect the financial implications for us to be modest in the early years primarily product development funding until substantial product revenues are generated  beginning one to two years following the commercial introduction of our partner s product 
in the future  we believe that our strategy to expand the proportion of our revenue from higher margin  recurring sources such as labchip products  and to continue to expand our base of service business revenues will lessen the potential negative impact on our business of customers reduced capital spending patterns 

table of contents results of operations our financial results for the year ended december  include the financial results of zymark from the date of acquisition  july   through december  revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands product revenue service revenue     n a license fees and contract revenue total revenue total revenue 
our total revenue increase in was principally the result of having the benefit of a full year of sales of products we acquired as a result of the zymark acquisition  while our results included sales of zymark products for only the latter half of other factors underlying our revenue growth in are discussed in further detail below 
in  the increase in total revenue over was due almost exclusively to the additional revenues from sales of zymark products  offset  in part  by a million decrease in sales to amphora 
product revenue 
approximately million of the increase in product revenue in was the result of having a full year of the acquired zymark product sales in our operating results versus a partial year in in addition  the increase in product revenue included increased sales to agilent  and increased sales of our labchip instrument newly introduced in  offset by a decline in datapoint revenues 
agilent revenues increased as a result of increased labchip kit purchases including purchases of sipper chips that run on agilent s new instrument  a volume driven increase in the share of the gross margin we receive for chips  reagents and instruments sold by agilent  and a retroactive price adjustment to labchip kits previously purchased by agilent 
the amphora datapoint revenue decline came about as a result of amphora having prepaid approximately million in for the right to generate a certain number of datapoints 
as a result of this prepayment  we had no additional datapoint revenue from amphora in however  we expect that amphora will begin to owe us for additional datapoints generated beginning in early  and we are in the process of negotiating new datapoint pricing terms 
the increase in product revenue in was due almost exclusively to the revenue added by the acquired zymark products 
the remainder of the product revenue increase resulted from higher revenue from agilent  offset by a net decline in sales of our other products  especially caliper drug discovery system sales 
service revenue 
prior to the acquisition of zymark  we did not have significant service revenue 
the increase in both and primarily consisted of annual maintenance contracts and support services associated with the installed base of zymark products 
license fees and contract revenue 
in  the total net decrease in license fees and contract revenue was the result of a million decrease in license fees and a decrease in contract revenue from agilent of approximately million  offset in part by an increase in contract revenue from our other collaboration partners of approximately million 
the decrease in license fees was primarily due to payments from aclara and molecular devices received in for which there were no comparable revenue sources in the decrease was partially offset by a license fee we received from predicant biosciences under a new patent licensing agreement and ongoing royalties we received from molecular devices based upon their imap product sales 
agilent contract revenues decreased because we have not had any new collaborative development projects with agilent since our collaboration agreement terminated in may this decrease was more than offset by new sources of contract revenues as a result of having formed new strategic collaborations  such as bio rad 
in  license fees and contract revenues increased primarily due to an 
table of contents increase in license fees and contract revenues from non agilent collaborations  including zymark research and development collaborations  and the initial license fee we received from molecular devices as a result of the settlement of our patent infringement lawsuit against molecular devices in november these sources of revenue were partially offset by a million decline in research and development funding from agilent as we concluded several development programs related to the agilent bioanalyzer and product lines 
cost of revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands cost of product revenue service revenue     n a total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
in both and  cost of product revenue increased primarily due to higher product revenues driven mainly by the zymark acquisition 
in  we reduced headcount in our labchip manufacturing operations see restructuring charges below  which reduced our costs by approximately  during the last half of the increase also included a million write off of caliper instrument inventory prompted by the development and release of our new labchip drug discovery system  and amortization of  of purchase price that was allocated to acquired zymark inventories 
in addition  approximately million of the increase in resulted from excess manufacturing capacity previously absorbed by research and development programs 
cost of service revenue 
costs of service revenue in and represents costs incurred in relation to providing billable services and supporting installed systems under annual maintenance contracts  including parts replacement and service labor and overhead 
in  the increase of million relates primarily to the inclusion of a full year of legacy zymark service costs 
gross margins 
our gross margin on product revenue was for the year ended december   as compared to in reduced product obsolescence charges and the absence of further purchase accounting amortization  as noted above  accounted for approximately of this improvement 
the remainder of the gross margin improvement resulted from increased leverage of fixed manufacturing costs in relation to sales and the effects of cost reductions across the combined businesses

table of contents research and development expenses 
in  research and development expenses decreased despite the inclusion of a full year of zymark r d and acquired research and development of million  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  due to prioritization of our r d programs and related downsizing activities that occurred in  and as a result of the facility closures in that reduced the amount of facility related costs within r d by approximately  in  research and development expenses declined despite the acquisition of zymark  which contributed million to our overall ongoing r d expenses  primarily due to our r d prioritization efforts and the associated employee downsizing actions  which are described in restructuring charges below 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to decrease in the future to the extent our revenues grow and as we slow the pace of discretionary spending on research programs by focusing on those opportunities with maximum commercial viability and sharing the funding of r d programs with other partners 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of zymark in the full year results of operations  offset  in part  by downsizing activities in and in  implementation costs of section of the sarbanes oxley act of were approximately million versus insignificant costs in in  sg a expenses increased primarily due to the additional costs of zymark for the period following the acquisition  offset in part by cost synergies realized through our integration efforts 
we expect selling  marketing and product promotion expenses to increase modestly over the next several years as we continue to make investments to grow our sales 
employee stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference  at the date of grant  between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of stock awards including stock options and restricted stock issuances 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of million related to stock awards granted to retain certain key executives and employees in connection with our acquisition and subsequent integration with zymark 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of million related to stock awards granted to retain certain key executives and employees 
we are amortizing these amounts over the respective vesting periods using the accelerated expense attribution method 
the amortization expense related to deferred stock compensation in and was net of reversals of  and  respectively  of stock compensation expense recognized in previous periods as a result of forfeited options 
of the million of remaining deferred stock compensation included within stockholder s equity as of december   we expect to record amortization of deferred compensation expense of million during and the remaining million during future periods beyond the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may further decrease if unvested options and restricted stock awards for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled 
restructuring charges 
below is a summary of various restructuring activities during the period september through december we recorded charges totaling million related to facility closures 
as a result of efficiencies achieved following our prioritization of research and development programs  in june we were able to shut down one half of a mountain view  ca facility that was primarily used for research and development activities 
in december  we completed the full closure of this building  and we reassessed our previous estimates regarding the sublease potential of our two idled facilities 
we adjusted our previous restructuring charges on the basis of recent market information that indicated a low probability of obtaining sublease income from these properties 
the ongoing payments will reduce the liability we have recorded as of december   of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report  and the only expected ongoing impact to our statement of operations will be accretion of interest  provided that the assumptions considered in determining the restructuring charge do not change 

table of contents we recorded a charge of  in june as a result of a downsizing that reduced manufacturing headcount in our labchip manufacturing operation by positions 
all separation payments were completed in we believe that this downsizing will result in an estimated annual savings of approximately million 
we also recognized a  credit related to severance payments made in which were less than the provision estimate we made in we recorded a million charge  based upon the estimated net present value of our future lease payments related to the closure of one of our mountain view facilities  net of anticipated sublease rentals  including leasehold improvement write offs and other asset disposals of  related to the building closure 
the facility lease accrual charge involved certain key assumptions including the amount  if any  of future sublease rentals which we subsequently revised to zero in we recorded total charges of million during for three downsizing actions related to severance and benefits  including  of non cash charges related to acceleration of stock option vesting for certain terminated employees 
two of these reductions in force were completed following our acquisition of zymark  and were principally related to elimination of redundant positions  the relocation of instrument manufacturing to hopkinton  ma  and the prioritization of research and development programs 
these actions resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  including in research and development  in manufacturing operations and service  and in selling  general and administration 
as of december   approximately million of the million remained in accrued restructuring charges  and remaining payments were completed by december we recorded a charge of  in september  due to a reduction in force carried out in response to depressed market conditions 
this action resulted in the elimination of positions  including in research and development with the remaining divided equally between manufacturing and administrative functions 
all of the associated cash payments were completed in interest and other income and expenses year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands interest income interest expense n a   other income  net interest income expense  net 
interest income decreased in both and primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  on average  over the previous years due to cash used in operating and investing activities 
in  interest income was particularly lower due to approximately million of cash used to acquire zymark in july interest expense decreased in due to the reduction of our financing obligations 
other income  net 
other income  net in consists primarily of marking to market unrealized gains and losses related to account balances denominated in non us currencies 
other income  net of million in resulted primarily from the effect of realized gains on marketable securities  and unrealized foreign currency gains  offset in part by the disposal of surplus manufacturing equipment no longer needed in our operations 
other income  net in was primarily due to realized gains on marketable securities 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since the company s inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sale of equity  product sales and services  out licensing revenues  contract and milestone payments to us under our collaboration and former technology access program agreements  million received from the comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara  and equipment financing under sale leaseback arrangements 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of million from issuances of common and preferred stock  which includes million raised in august from the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement and million raised from our initial public offering in december as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash  as compared to million as of december  and million as of december  in july  we used cash of million to acquire zymark  which was net of million of zymark s cash on hand on the date of acquisition 
as such  our cash flow changes in operating assets and liabilities are net of the acquired current assets and liabilities of zymark 
the inclusion of zymark s results of operations after july   had a significant impact on the business in and the comparability of operating results and cash flows on a year over year basis 
cash flows year ended year ended year ended december  increase december  increase december  decrease decrease in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
in  our cash used in operations decreased from as a result of our reduced net loss before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  stock compensation and restructuring charges 
the narrowed loss was enabled by the significant increase in our overall sales and corresponding cash collections from customers  especially as a result of having a full year of the acquired zymark business in our results 
we spent more on materials to support our higher sales  but elsewhere we reduced our cost structure  leading to the reduction in the amount of cash used for operating activities 
in addition  we paid out million in severance and lease payments related to restructuring activities 
all other changes in working capital resulted in a use of  of cash 
in  our cash used in operations increased from primarily due to the million payment we received as a settlement payment from aclara in in addition  excluding this impact in  our cash used for operating activities in improved in comparison to this improvement is primarily attributable to the reductions in force that we implemented during and  and other cost cutting measures including more focused r d activities  which were reflected in our financial results 
investing activities 
in  our purchases of property and equipment increased primarily due to our investment of million related to the purchase and on going implementation of our new oracle erp system 
otherwise  our investment needs decreased overall as there was no similar sized investment need comparable to our acquisition of zymark in coupled with our improved operating cash flows  we derived less cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
in  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily caused by million of additional proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable securities in order to finance the acquisition of zymark which utilized million of cash  and also due to a million decrease in property equipment purchases 
financing activities 
in  cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to an increase in proceeds from common stock sales pursuant to option exercises and employee stock plan purchases  and a decrease in the payments made under sale leaseback and other long term obligations 
in 
table of contents  cash used in financing activities decreased as a result of increased sale leaseback debt payments  a decline in sale leaseback financing proceeds  and a decline in proceeds from common stock sales 
as of december   we had commitments under leases and other contractual obligations as follows other operating sale leaseback long term leases idle facilities arrangements obligations years ending december thereafter total minimum lease and principal payments less amount representing interest present value of future payments less current portion of obligations noncurrent portion of obligations in addition to the commitments in the table above  as of december   we had a non cancelable purchase commitment in the amount of approximately  with the foreign supplier of our proprietary glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of chips 
we also have minimum royalty obligations under separate license agreements with ut battelle  llc and the trustees of the university of pennsylvania that in the aggregate never exceed  per year 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and acquisitions 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continuing our research and development efforts  expanding our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
based on current plans  we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the year our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
we ended with million in total cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash 
we expect to attain positive cash flows from operations during the fourth quarter of  and believe our current cash balances are adequate to satisfy our cash needs through the end of our actual cash needs could vary considerably  however  depending on opportunities that arise over time 
if  at any time  cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our research and development efforts  sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the inability to obtain additional 
table of contents financing may force delays in research and product development activities and  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
financial outlook 
for the first quarter and full year our outlook is as follows we project first quarter revenues in the range of to million  and full year revenues in the range of million 
we project combined gross margins from products and services in the range of to in the first quarter and to on a full year basis 
the financial projections that we have provided above are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in the section entitled factors affecting operating results below 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
restructuring charges 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million and  respectively 
we established exit plans for activities which took place in the period and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sublease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we further consolidated our space needs in mountain view  ca  and in connection with this we also evaluated recent real estate market conditions in mountain view  ca 
as a result of our review  we determined that the probability of subleasing our vacant facilities was low 
this caused us to lower our monthly sublease income estimate from per square foot to zero on approximately  square feet of available space  and to increase our estimated liability for the fair value of the remaining lease rentals by approximately million during the fourth quarter of if we are able to identify a sublease tenant  enter into a favorable lease buy out related to the idle space  or otherwise reassess our use of 
table of contents the vacant space  we may be required to further revise the restructuring accrual that we have recorded as of december  for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note  restructuring activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
revenue recognition 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices  or where no historic information exists  based upon management s estimate of the probable selling prices for such undelivered items 
the amount of our product revenue is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether there is objective evidence of fair value for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we recognize contract revenue for certain arrangements based upon proportional performance which requires that we estimate resources required to perform the work 
the extent to which our resource estimates prove to be inaccurate could affect the timing of the revenue recognition for a particular contract arrangement 
accounts receivable reserves 
we grant credit to customers based on evaluations of their financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
we attempt to limit credit risk by monitoring our exposure for credit losses 
this analysis may involve review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
we establish allowances for those accounts considered uncollectible based on the analysis of the recoverability of our trade accounts receivable performed at the end of each reporting period 
establishing an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts involves the use of considerable judgment and subjectivity 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to estimate the adequacy of our accounts receivable reserves which could require future adjustment to our reserve provisions 
caliper s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
caliper wrote off  and  of accounts deemed uncollectible in and  respectively 
inventory reserves 
we reserve or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
caliper defines obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to caliper 
caliper uses a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  caliper also considers parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be impacted by engineering changes  and known design changes which would reduce caliper s ability to use the inventory as planned 
determination of the excess balance is highly subjective and relies in part on the accuracy of our forecasts and our assessment of market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  additional write downs may be required 
conversely  if conditions are more favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations in that period 
during and  respectively  caliper recorded charges of million and million to cost of product revenues for excess and obsolete inventories 
of the amount charged to cost of product revenue in  million was related to the discontinuance of the caliper drug discovery instrument 
warranty provision 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
caliper offers a one year limited warranty on instrumentation products and a day warranty on chips  which is included in the sales price of many of its products 
caliper s standard limited warranty covers repair or replacement of defective goods  a preventative maintenance visit on certain products  and telephone based technical support 
no upgrades are included in the standard warranty 
provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of sale 

table of contents factors that affect caliper s warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
caliper periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts amounts as necessary 
goodwill 
we perform a test for the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the company with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
we performed our fiscal annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based upon our market capitalization at the time  we concluded that we did not have any impairment 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during  we recorded impairment charges of  related to certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets no longer being used 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
caliper will be required to adopt statement r at the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of statement r will have on our results of operations and related disclosures 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provisions of sfs factors affecting operating results risks related to our business our labchip products may not achieve widespread market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to grow slowly or decline 
the commercial success of our labchip products depends upon market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery and automated electrophoresis separations systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers  and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
however  because our microfluidic drug discovery and automated electrophoresis systems have been in operation for only a limited period of time  their accuracy  reliability  ease of use and commercial value have 
table of contents not yet gained widespread commercial acceptance 
if these systems do not continue to gain further market acceptance  our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline 
in addition  our strategy for the labchip system depends upon the early users of these systems buying additional units as they spread the adoption of this technology throughout their organizations worldwide 
new customers for our drug discovery systems may wait for indications from our initial drug discovery system customers that our drug discovery systems work effectively and generate substantial benefits 
if the early users of our labchip systems do not endorse the further adoption of these systems because they fail to generate the quantities and quality of data they expected  are too difficult or costly to use  or are otherwise deficient in meeting the screening needs of these customers  further sales of these systems to these early users may be limited  and our sales to new users will be more difficult 
our microfluidic based drug discovery systems are now being marketed and sold principally by the sales and marketing organization we acquired with our acquisition of zymark 
these systems and the technologies on which they are based are still relatively new to this sales and marketing organization  which may limit our ability to effectively market and sell these systems 
if we cannot market these systems effectively  their market acceptance may be limited 
for all of the foregoing reasons  we cannot assure you that our efforts to increase the adoption of our high throughput drug screening and automated electrophoresis systems  by both existing and new users  will be expeditious or effective 
in summary  market acceptance of our labchip systems will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our labchip drug discovery systems over alternative well established technologies  our ability to develop a broader range of standard assays and applications that enable customers and potential customers to perform many different types of experiments on a single labchip instrument system  and our ability to market and sell our drug discovery systems and related consumable products 
if we are not successful in developing new and enhanced liquid handling  labchip and other life sciences products  we may lose market share to our competitors 
the life sciences productivity tools equipment market is very competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
the commercial success of our liquid handling systems  labchip and other products depends upon continued and expanding market acceptance of our systems and products by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and genomics research organizations  and upon our ability to address quickly any performance problems that our customers encounter 
we anticipate that our competitors will introduce new  enhanced products in this market in the near future 
our future success will depend on our ability to offer new products and technologies that researchers believe are an attractive alternative to current products and technologies  that address the evolving needs of our customers and that are technologically superior to new products that may be offered by our competitors 
we may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts for new products  and we may not ultimately be successful in developing them 
any significant delay in releasing new products in this market could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share 
if we are not successful in improving the cost of our labchip products relative to the performance delivered  we may not be successful in displacing alternative or more established products and technologies that are competitive with our labchip products 
customers in the life sciences productivity tools equipment market tend to be very price and cost sensitive relative to product performance 
the commercial success of our labchip products will depend not only upon our ability to demonstrate that their performance is superior to the performance of conventional 
table of contents products  but also that their total cost to purchase and operate is competitive with or lower than the cost of alternative or more established products 
we may need to reduce our manufacturing costs in order for us sell our labchip products at more competitive prices 
although we have been successful in achieving significant reductions in the manufacturing costs of our labchip instruments and chips  we are engaged in ongoing efforts to further reduce the costs of our labchip products 
some of these efforts involve a substantial amount of technical risk  such as manufacturing our chips on plastic substrates rather than glass 
if we are not successful in achieving these additional cost reductions  the market demand for our labchip products may be limited  and the rate of adoption of these products may be slower than we anticipate 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to achieve further cost reductions will be successful 
if we do not successfully expand the range of applications for our drug discovery systems  we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
because drug screening systems represent substantial capital expenditures  it is important that these systems be capable of performing a wide variety of different types of assays and experiments in order to justify the cost of the systems 
we intend to continue developing new versions of our microfluidic based drug discovery systems with enhanced features that address existing or emerging customer needs  such as offering a broad range of standardized  easy to use assays 
if we are unable to do so  our drug discovery systems may not become more widely used and we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we currently have several assays in development  including assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
we are developing product extensions that are particularly well suited for the evaluation of kinases  one of the largest focus areas of drug discovery efforts today  as well as running assays with adherent cell lines 
we are creating new tools to make it easier for our customers to develop their own custom assays in a microfluidic format 
we are also developing kinase profiling and selectivity screening kits 
if we are not able to complete the development of any of these expanded applications and tools  or if we experience difficulties or delays  we may lose our current customers and may not be able to obtain new customers 
we are subject to the capital spending patterns of the pharmaceutical industry  which over the past several years have been adversely impacted by general economic conditions  industry consolidation and increased competition 
many of our instrument products represent relatively large capital expenditures by our customers 
during the past several years  many of our customers and potential customers  particularly in the pharmaceutical industry  have reduced their capital spending budgets because of generally adverse prevailing economic conditions  consolidation in the industry  and increased pressure on the profitability of pharmaceutical companies  due in part to more competition from generic drugs 
if our customers and potential customers do not increase their capital spending budgets  because of continuing adverse economic conditions or further consolidation in the industry  we could face weak demand for our products  in particular our products used for high throughput screening 
if the demand for our instrument products is weak because of constrained capital spending by our pharmaceutical industry customers and potential customers  we may not achieve our targets for revenue and cash flow from operations 
a significant portion of our business depends upon collaborations with oem business partners  and our financial success depends upon our ability to develop new product concepts with compelling value propositions to generate new oem collaboration relationships  as well as our ability to manage our existing oem relationships 
historically  an important part of our business strategy has been to collaborate with oem business partners in the development of new applications for our microfluidic and liquid handling products and the subsequent commercialization of the developed products 
the expenses associated with these product development efforts are large  and the time to market for these product development efforts is generally two or more years 
accordingly  attracting an oem collaboration partner to undertake and underwrite a proposed product development effort requires a compelling value proposition for the product proposed to be developed 

table of contents moreover  even if we are successful in initiating a new product development effort with an oem partner  these collaboration arrangements can be difficult to manage  and technical problems encountered in the development programs or disagreements with our oem business partners may adversely impact our ability to complete development programs  and therefore to realize increased product sales through these product development and commercialization collaborations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to define compelling new products  or to identify new collaboration partners or new applications for our technologies to develop with our existing collaboration partners 
if we are unable to define new product opportunities or to identify new collaboration partners or to agree on the terms of a collaboration  or if we are unable to identify new applications for our technologies to develop and commercialize with an existing collaboration partner  our revenues could decline and the growth of our business could be adversely affected 
potential future acquisitions may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us 
our business is highly competitive and our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and offer products to our customers that provide a more complete solution 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  such as our acquisition of zymark in july from time to time  we consider and evaluate potential business combinations both involving our acquisition of another company and transactions involving the sale of caliper through  among other things  a possible merger or consolidation of our business into that of another entity 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential cost and disruptions caused by the integration of financial reporting systems and development of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  accounting consequences  including amortization of acquired intangible assets or other required purchase accounting adjustments  resulting in variability or reductions of our reported earnings  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in these markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of caliper or the acquired company due to the employment uncertainties inherent in the acquisition process  the assumption of known and potentially unknown liabilities of the acquired company  the risk that we may find that the acquired company or business does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the company or business was worth  our relationship with current and new employees and customers could be impaired  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties who believe a claim against us would be valuable to pursue  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture and legal contingencies  among other matters  and insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  or incur other large and immediate write offs 

table of contents we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business 
we must also maintain our ability to manage any growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses in we may never achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  product marketing and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
these costs have exceeded our interest income and revenue which  to date  have been generated principally from product sales  collaborative research and development agreements  technology access fees  cash and investment balances 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we expect they will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  many of our products represent relatively large capital expenditures for our customers  which leads to variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products because customers may take several months or longer to evaluate and obtain the necessary internal approvals for the purchase of our products 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of relatively high priced products  and these sales are generally made by purchase orders and not long term contracts 
delays in receipt of anticipated orders for higher priced products could lead to substantial variability of revenue from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  we commonly receive purchase orders and ship a significant portion of each quarter s product orders near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  even short delays in the receipt of orders or shipment of products at the end of a quarter could result in shipment during the next quarter  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the quarter in which the shipment did not occur 
our business is affected by capital spending patterns of our customers with a greater percentage of purchases  and therefore we typically experience higher revenues in the second half of our fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
for all of these and other reasons  it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a reliable indication of our future performance 
if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangible assets are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays  which could result in lost revenue 
although agilent manufactures the agilent bioanalyzer and bio rad manufactures the experion instrument system  we manufacture the chips used in these instruments and in the agilent instrument system 
we also currently manufacture instruments and sipper chips for our drug discovery systems 
if we fail to deliver chips and automated drug discovery products in a timely manner  our relationships with our customers could be seriously harmed  and revenue would decline 
we currently have one manufacturing location for labchip products in mountain view  california  and one manufacturing location for instruments and other products located in hopkinton  massachusetts 
the actual number of chips we are able to sell or use depends in part upon the manufacturing yields for these chips 
we have only recently begun to manufacture significant numbers of sipper chips and are continuing to develop our manufacturing procedures for these chips 
in order to offer sipper chips with four or more capillaries for drug discovery applications  we will need 
table of contents to continue to achieve consistently high yields in this process 
we have experienced difficulties in manufacturing both our chips and instruments 
we cannot assure you that manufacturing or quality problems will not continue or arise as we attempt to scale up our production of chips or that we can scale up manufacturing in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable costs 
if we are unable to consistently manufacture sipper chips or chips for the agilent bioanalyzer or the bio rad experion instrument systems on a timely basis because of these or other factors  our product sales will decline 
we are currently manufacturing drug discovery instruments in house and in limited volumes 
if demand for our drug discovery instruments increases significantly  we will either need to expand our in house manufacturing capabilities or outsource to other manufacturers  which could result in a decrease in yields  and therefore an increase in manufacturing costs and a decrease in net income from sales 
our ability to scale up chip manufacturing may be compromised by uncertainty regarding the volume of chips for the agilent bioanalyzer and the bio rad experion instrument systems that we will need to supply to agilent and bio rad in the future 
due to our termination of our exclusive collaboration with agilent in may  agilent now has the option to manufacture chips itself rather than continue to receive its supply of chips from caliper 
accordingly  we face uncertainty regarding future demand for these chips from our manufacturing operations 
because agilent and a small number of other customers have accounted for  and may continue to account for  a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline due to the loss of one of these customers 
historically  we have had very few customers and one commercial partner  agilent  from which we have derived the majority of our revenue  although our acquisition of zymark in july greatly expanded our customer base 
during  agilent accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
if we were to lose agilent as a customer for our chips  and one or more of our other significant customers  our revenue could decrease significantly 
our revenue could decline due to the termination of our agreement with agilent because of a number of different factors  including a reduction in our gross margin share of agilent bioanalyzer and labchip products sold by agilent or reduced sales of such products by agilent due to competition from us or our other commercial partners 
due to our termination of the collaboration agreement with agilent  effective in may  we are now operating under the surviving provisions of that agreement 
we will continue to receive revenue from agilent based on a formula for gross margin sharing on sales by agilent of instruments and chips developed under our collaboration agreement  and we expect to continue to receive revenue from agilent based on our sale of sipper chips to agilent for its instrument system 
although we anticipate that future sales of the agilent bioanalyzer system will further expand our revenue base  under the surviving provisions of our agreement with agilent  our gross margin share of collaboration products sold by agilent declined at the end of  and will decline again in may if sales of these products do not increase fast enough to offset the decline in our gross margin share  the amount of revenue we receive from agilent will decline 
in addition  under the surviving terms of our agreement with agilent  we granted to agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies existing as of the termination date for agilent to develop  make and sell products in the field of the collaboration 
consequently  there is the possibility that agilent may manufacture its own supply of labchip products  rather than purchasing them from us  or that we may experience competition from agilent in the future  which would reduce our ability to sell products independently or through other commercial partners 
now that our agreement with agilent is terminated  agilent s sales of collaboration products could be reduced due to competition from us or our other commercial partners  such as bio rad 
in such event  the revenue we would receive from agilent could be reduced by more than the revenue we receive from other commercial partners 
further  agilent may decide for reasons wholly independent of competition to reduce its sales efforts and or pricing for these products 
if agilent does so  our revenue may decline 

table of contents we depend on our key personnel  the loss of whom would impair our ability to compete 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management team  especially our chief executive officer  and certain of our scientific staff 
the loss of services of any of these persons could seriously harm our product development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  research  product development  and commercialization will require additional skilled personnel in areas such as chemistry and biology  software engineering and electronic engineering 
our principal business locations in the united states are silicon valley  california  and in the boston metropolitan area  where demand for personnel with these skills remains high  and may increase further as the economic outlook in these areas improves 
as a result  competition for and retention of personnel  particularly for employees with technical expertise  is intense and the turnover rate for these people is high 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
the inability to retain and hire qualified personnel could also hinder any planned expansion of our business 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology or potential products 
in addition  a third party has provoked an interference action in the us patent and trademark office with respect to one issued us patent that we have exclusively licensed to determine the priority of the inventions covered by that patent 
any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patents to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position  especially in our microfluidics business 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  such as the patent infringement suit against molecular devices we settled in november these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
they would put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
we may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  will be commercially valuable 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative  it could cause our stock price to decline 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the 
table of contents development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
we are dependent on a single source supplier for the glass used in our labchip products and if we are unable to buy this glass on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our labchip products to customers 
we currently purchase a key component for our chips from a single source supplier located in germany 
although we keep surplus inventory in our mountain view manufacturing facility  if we are unable to replenish this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our chips to our customers  which would harm our business 
we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies for our products 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are provided by a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers  some of which are our competitors 
we currently purchase additional components  such as optical  electronic  and pneumatic devices  in configurations specific to our requirements that  together with certain other components  such as computers  are integrated into our products 
we maintain only a limited number of long term supply agreements with our suppliers 
our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including the following we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components  we have reduced control over pricing and the timely delivery of components and subassemblies  and our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves complex processes and requires long lead times  we may experience delays or shortages caused by suppliers 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained at the same prices and on substantially the same terms and conditions  if necessary  for most sole and limited source parts 
however  if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  we might be forced to redesign our systems  which could prevent us from shipping our systems to customers on a timely basis 
some of our suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources  and  therefore  their businesses could fail 
any inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and subassemblies  or any other circumstance that would restrict our ability to ship our products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our business 
if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenue 
we rely on a single manufacturing location to produce our chips and drug discovery systems  and a single location to produce laboratory automation and robotics systems  with no alternative facilities 
these facilities and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time 
our manufacturing facilities may be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods 
earthquakes are of particular significance because our labchip product manufacturing facility is located in 
table of contents mountain view  california  an earthquake prone area 
in the event that our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment is affected by man made or natural disasters  we would be unable to manufacture products for sale  meet customer demands or sales projections 
if our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased  it would harm our business 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  together with the revenue to be derived from our commercial partners and from commercial sales of our microfluidic and lab automation products and services  will enable us to maintain currently planned operations at least through the year however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including our acquisition of another company or business 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise needed capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital 
to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our tax net operating losses and credit carryforwards may expire if we do not achieve or maintain profitability 
as of december   caliper had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
caliper also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through beginning in the year if not utilized 
state net operating losses of approximately  expired in the current remaining state net operating losses have varying expiration dates through utilization of the federal and state net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
because of our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty of realizing these net operating losses  the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile  and you could lose a substantial portion of your investment 
our stock has been trading on the nasdaq national market only since mid december we initially offered our common stock to the public at per share 
since then our stock price has been extremely volatile and has ranged  through march  from a high of approximately per share on march  to a low of per share both on january  and february  our stock price may drop 
table of contents substantially following an investment in our common stock 
we expect that our stock price will remain volatile as a result of a number of factors  including announcements by analysts regarding their assessment of caliper and its prospects  announcements by our competitors of complementary or competing products and technologies  announcements of our financial results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  and general market volatility for technology stocks 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have been sued  and are at risk of future securities class action litigation 
in the spring and summer of  class action lawsuits were filed against certain leading investment banks and over companies that did public offerings during the prior several years  including lawsuits against caliper and certain of its officers and directors as described under part i item legal proceedings 
this and other securities litigation could result in potential liability  cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management s attention and resources  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  announcements of future lawsuits of this or some other nature  and announcements of events occurring during the course of the current and any future lawsuits  could cause our stock price to drop 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition in which we are not the surviving company or changes in our management 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination including us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  switzerland  canada and japan 
to the extent our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
while foreign exchange gains and losses have historically been immaterial  we cannot predict whether such gains and losses will continue to be immaterial  especially as our sales grow outside the united states 
we cannot predict whether changes in exchange rates or whether foreign exchange gains and losses will have a material impact on our income 
during  sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our total revenues  of which were sales denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments at either december  or our equipment sale leaseback financings  amounting to  as of december   and million at december   were all at fixed rates and  therefore  have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  asset backed securities  and corporate bonds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective
