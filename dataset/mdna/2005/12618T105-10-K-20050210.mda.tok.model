item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading economic  financial  and business consulting firm that applies advanced analytic techniques and in depth industry knowledge to complex engagements for a broad range of clients 
we offer two types of services legal and regulatory consulting and business consulting 
we estimate that we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal from business consulting and legal and regulatory consulting  and approximately from neuco  a subsidiary of which we own 
neuco develops and markets a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services that are currently focused on electricity generation by utilities 
we derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee consultants 
in most instances  we charge clients on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services 
we charge consultants time at hourly rates  which vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant s position  experience  and expertise  and other factors 
we derive a portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts 
revenues from fixed price engagements are recognized using a proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred  substantially all of which are labor related  to the total estimated project costs 
we derived and of our revenues from fixed price engagements in fiscal and  respectively 
we generate substantially all of our professional services fees from the work of our own employee consultants and a portion from the work of our non employee experts 
factors that affect our professional services revenues include the number and scope of client engagements  the number of consultants we employ  the consultants billing rates  and the number of hours our consultants work 
revenues also include reimbursements  or expenses billed to clients  which include travel and other out of pocket expenses  outside consultants  and other reimbursable expenses 
our costs of services include the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our employee consultants 
our bonus program awards discretionary bonuses based on our revenues and profitability and individual performance 
costs of services also include out of pocket and other expenses that are billed to clients  and the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of support staff whose time is billed directly to clients  such as librarians  editors  and programmers 
our gross profit  which equals revenues less costs of services  is affected by changes in our mix of revenues 
we experience significantly higher gross margins on revenues from professional service fees than on revenues from expenses billed to clients 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our administrative and support staff  fees to non employee experts for generating new business  office rent  marketing  and other costs 
utilization because we derive the majority of our revenues from hourly billings by our employee consultants  our utilization of those employee consultants is one key indicator that we use to measure our operating performance 
we calculate utilization by dividing the total hours worked by our employee consultants on engagements during the measurement period by the total number of hours that our employee consultants were available to work during that period 
utilization was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal  and percent for fiscal historically  we have experienced higher utilization in our legal and regulatory consulting practice than in our business consulting practice because our business consulting practice devotes a greater portion of its time to sales and marketing efforts 
we experience certain seasonal effects that impact our utilization 
because our revenues depend on the number of hours worked by our employee consultants  concurrent vacations by a large number of consultants can adversely impact our utilization 
historically  we experience lower utilization in the first quarter  which includes the holiday season  and in the third quarter  which includes the summer vacation season 
fiscal periods our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in november  and accordingly  our fiscal year will periodically contain weeks rather than weeks 
in particular  fiscal contained weeks 
this additional week of operations in fiscal will affect the comparability of results of operations of this fiscal year with other fiscal years 
historically  we have managed our business based on four week billing cycles to clients and  consequently  have established quarters that are divisible by four week periods 
as a result  the first  second  and fourth quarters of each fiscal year are week periods  and the third quarter of each fiscal year is a week period 
however  the fourth quarter in fiscal was weeks long 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful if the periods being compared have different lengths 
the additional week in fiscal resulted in million of revenues and was not material to our results of operations 
the terms fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  refer to the week periods ended november   and november   the week period ended november   and the week periods ended november   november   respectively 
acquisitions and international expansion on november   we completed the acquisition of network economics consulting group pty ltd necg  an australia based regulatory and economic consulting firm  for a purchase price of approximately million valued as of the date of the acquisition after deducting cash acquired  and after adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid or accrued  consisting of million in cash and  restricted shares of our common stock valued at million 
cra may be required to pay additional purchase consideration over the next three years following the transaction  in cash and our stock  if specific performance targets are met 
any additional payments related to this contingency will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
the necg acquisition added employee consultants  and we believe it greatly enhances our position in the australian regulatory market  providing us with an important platform for growth in the asia pacific region 
a preliminary allocation of the million purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily includes million of accounts receivable  million of unbilled services  million of intangibles  and million of goodwill 
the purchase price allocation will be finalized as we receive other information relevant to the acquisition 
on november   we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of tabors caramanis associates tca  a cambridge  massachusetts based economics and engineering consulting firm  for a purchase price of approximately million after adding a working capital adjustment  acquisition costs  and transaction fees paid or accrued  consisting of million in cash and  restricted shares of our common stock valued at million 
cra may be required to pay additional purchase consideration over the next two years following the transaction  in cash and our stock  if specific performance targets are met 
any additional payments related to this contingency will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
the tca acquisition added employee consultants and expands our core competency in worldwide energy consulting 
a preliminary allocation of the million purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily includes million of accounts receivable  million of unbilled services  million of intangibles  and million of goodwill 
the purchase price allocation will be finalized as we receive other information relevant to the acquisition 
on april   we completed the acquisition of intecap  inc intecap for a purchase price of approximately million after deducting cash acquired  and after adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid or accrued 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations beginning may  the intecap acquisition added approximately employee consultants and expanded our geographic footprint into key markets such as chicago and new york  and strengthened our presence in houston  silicon valley  boston and washington dc the allocation of the million purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily includes million of accounts receivable  million of unbilled services  million of intangibles  consisting primarily of non competition agreements  and million of goodwill 
in april and may  we completed the acquisitions of certain assets of the north american and uk operations of the chemicals and energy vertical practice cev of the then arthur d 
little corporation adl for an aggregate of million in cash 
the acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the effective date of the acquisition of the north american business was april   and the effective date of the acquisition of the uk business was may  the results of operations related to the acquisitions have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the respective effective dates 
we believe that the acquisition of the cev business enhanced our position in consulting to the chemicals and petroleum industries 
we acquired employee consultants  accounts receivable  and the ongoing client projects being handled by the acquired employee consultants 
of the million purchase price  million was recorded as intangibles  consisting primarily of customer relationships  million was recorded primarily as accounts receivable  and the remaining million was recorded as goodwill  all of which is expected to be deducted for tax purposes 
the portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill primarily related to the extensive industry experience of the acquired employee consultants 
in fiscal  our international operations declined from fiscal revenues from our international operations accounted for   and of our total revenues in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  as more fully described in note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
our international revenues for fiscal and reflect full years of operations of the uk portion of the cev business that we acquired in may this downturn was driven principally by the security related reduction in our middle east business and  to a lesser extent  on a percentage basis  the addition of intecap  which has a largely domestic presence 
we have expanded our presence in the asia pacific market with the acquisition of necg during the last quarter of fiscal  and continue to evaluate actively opportunities to strengthen our presence overseas 
software subsidiary in june  we acquired a majority interest in neuco  inc neuco was established by us and an affiliate of commonwealth energy systems as a start up entity to develop and market a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services for electric utilities 
neuco s financial statements are consolidated with our financial statements 
neuco recognized revenues of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal neuco generated net income of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal  and sustained a net loss of approximately million in fiscal our interest in neuco was   and  as of november   november   and november   respectively 
neuco s financial results have been consolidated with our financial results for all fiscal years presented  including fiscal  as our ownership interest  combined with other considerations  represented control 
in october  neuco issued additional shares to a minority interest stockholder in exchange for a note receivable 
in addition  certain neuco employees and directors arthur d 
little  inc is now known as dehon  inc 
exercised stock options 
as a result of these share transactions  our interest in neuco decreased to as of november  in march  neuco repurchased and cancelled shares from a minority interest stockholder  which increased our interest in neuco to 
these share transactions have been recorded as adjustments to capital 
the portion of the results of operations of neuco allocable to its other owners is shown as minority interest on our statement of income  and that amount  along with the capital contributions to neuco of its other owners  is shown as minority interest on our balance sheet 
all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates in these consolidated financial statements include  but are not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  depreciation of property and equipment  valuation of acquired intangible assets  accrued and deferred income taxes  and other accrued expenses 
these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if our assumptions based on past experience or our other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the performance of professional services 
the contracts that we enter into and operate under specify whether the engagement will be billed on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
these engagements generally last three to six months  although some of our engagements can be much longer in duration 
each contract must be approved by one of our vice presidents 
we recognize substantially all of our revenues under written service contracts with our clients where the fee is fixed or determinable  as the services are provided  and only in those situations where collection from the client is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is derived from time and materials service contracts 
revenues from time and materials service contracts are recognized as the services are provided based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates  as well as a computer services fee based upon hours worked 
revenues from fixed price engagements are recognized on a proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred  substantially all of which are labor related  to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the consultants on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
the proportional performance method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and terms set forth in the contract  and are indicative of the level of benefit provided to our clients 
our fixed price contracts generally include a termination provision that reduces the agreement to a time and materials contract in the event of termination of the contract 
there are no costs that are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
our financial management maintains contact with project managers to discuss the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and resources required to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate the anticipated income or loss on the project 
in the past  we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which have resulted in lower than anticipated income or losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenues also include reimbursements  or expenses billed to clients  which include travel and other out of pocket expenses  outside consultants  and other reimbursable expenses 
these reimbursable expenses included in revenues are as follows in thousands year ended november  november  november  reimbursable expenses billed to clients our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
for fiscal and fiscal  our average days sales outstanding dsos were days and days  respectively  excluding the effect of the necg and tca acquisitions completed in november we calculate dsos by dividing the sum of our accounts receivable and unbilled services balance  net of deferred revenue  at the end of the quarter by daily revenues 
daily revenues are calculated by dividing quarter revenues by the number of days in a quarter 
our project managers and finance personnel monitor payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection experience  current trends  and credit policy 
in determining these estimates  we examine historical write offs of our receivables and review client accounts to identify any specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to estimate accurately the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as of november   and november   million and million  respectively  were provided for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for our acquisitions of consolidated companies under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their expected useful lives 
intangible assets consist principally of non competition agreements  customer relationships  trade names  and property leases  which are amortized over two to ten years 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which we adopted in fiscal  we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an impairment review of our goodwill annually  or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment 
because we have one reporting segment  under sfas no 
 we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists 
no impairment of goodwill resulted from our evaluation of goodwill in any of the years presented 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of income 
the net amount of goodwill was approximately million as of november   which includes million from the intecap acquisition  million from the necg acquisition  and million from the tca acquisition  all of which occurred in fiscal year goodwill from the intecap acquisition decreased from million to million primarily as the result of the completion of our analysis of deferred tax assets acquired from intecap and the recording of approximately million of acquired deferred tax assets 
these goodwill amounts reflect our preliminary purchase price allocations and are subject to change 
the allocation for the intecap acquisition is based upon management s estimates  the valuation and appraisal of the intangible assets  and an analysis of the net deferred tax assets acquired 
the preliminary allocations for the necg and tca acquisitions are based upon management s current estimates of respective fair values  and will be finalized as it receives other information relevant to these acquisitions 
we assess the impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the net amount of intangible assets was approximately million as of november   which includes million from the intecap acquisition  million from the necg acquisition  and million from the tca acquisition 
these intangible asset amounts reflect our preliminary purchase price allocation and are subject to change 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that result from temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as net operating loss carryforwards 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
as a result of operating losses incurred in certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we recorded valuation allowances in certain of these foreign subsidiaries based on the facts and circumstances affecting each subsidiary 
had we not recorded these allowances of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  we would have reported a lower effective tax rate than that recognized in our statements of income in fiscal and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several different tax jurisdictions 
we are periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  we record estimated reserves for probable exposures 
based on our evaluation of current tax positions  we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
our effective tax rate increased to percent in fiscal  compared with percent in fiscal in september  we undertook a project to address the unfavorable tax consequences that resulted from activities and results in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we reduced our fiscal effective tax rate from the percent that had been estimated as of the third quarter year to date 
we intend to monitor our overseas operations and the related tax implications closely to determine whether there are opportunities to lower our effective tax rate further in the future 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction  and as a result of acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board the eitf reached a conclusion on eitf issue no 
the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  that contingently convertible debt instruments co cos will be subject to the if converted method under sfas no 
 earnings per share  sfas no 
regardless of whether a stock price related conversion contingency included in the instrument contingent price triggers  parity triggers  etc 
has been met 
under prior interpretations of sfas no 
 issuers of co cos excluded the potential common shares underlying the co cos from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the market price or other contingency was met 
furthermore  under a proposed amendment to sfas no 
 such that in order to remain under the treasury stock method of accounting  an issuer must commit  contractually and irrevocably to settle the par value of the debentures in cash 
the effective date of eitf is for periods ending after december  the proposed amendment to sfas no 
is expected to be issued in the first quarter of on december   we elected  contractually and irrevocably  to settle the par value of the debentures in cash 
as a result we continue to account for the debentures under the treasury stock method of accounting 
upon conversion  because of cash settlement of the principal  we expect that more of our shares will remain held by fundamental investors in cra  as opposed to being held by the financially oriented investors in our convertible debentures 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of the amendment to sfas no 
will have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment statement r 
statement r replaces sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
per apb opinion no 
 compensation expense was recognized only to the extent the fair value of common stock exceeded the stock option exercise price at the measurement date 
in addition  sfas no 
allowed pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
statement r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning june  we expect to adopt statement r in the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations the following table provides operating information as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended november  weeks november  weeks november  weeks revenues costs of services gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations interest income

revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the intecap acquisition  which contributed approximately million in revenue for fiscal aside from the additional revenue attributable to intecap  we experienced strong revenue growth primarily in our finance and competition practice areas  and to a lesser extent  our energy and environment  and pharmaceutical practice areas 
our strong growth in the competition practice is a result of increased mergers and acquisitions engagements  and continued strength in antitrust litigation 
the growth in our finance practice area resulted from increased demand for our services in general securities litigation  accounting malpractice litigation  and other financial based litigation 
the growth in our energy and environmental practice is due primarily to work related to the federal energy regulatory commission s various rule makings with regard to competitive electricity markets  as well as increased revenues from energy clients in the asia pacific region 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue primarily in our materials and manufacturing practice area 
the net increase in demand for our services is reflected in increased utilization and an increase in our average employee consultant headcount 
the total number of employee consultants increased to at the end of fiscal  which includes from the intecap acquisition  from the necg acquisition  and from the tca acquisition  from at the end of fiscal the remaining increase in headcount from the end of fiscal is due to continued hiring and recruiting efforts 
utilization was for fiscal as compared with for fiscal revenues derived from fixed price engagements decreased to of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in fixed price projects is due primarily to a downturn in our chemicals and petroleum practice  which traditionally entered into fixed price contracts and  to a lesser extent  on a percentage basis  the addition of intecap  which enters into relatively few fixed price engagements 
this downturn was driven principally by the security related reduction in our middle east business 
costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an overall increase in compensation expense for our employee consultants of million  primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of employee consultants  which includes million attributable to the intecap acquisition  and an increase in reimbursable expenses billed to clients of million 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due to an overall increase in revenue at a greater rate than the increases in reimbursable expenses billed to clients and an increased leverage arising from higher utilization of our employee consultants 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in overall compensation to our administrative staff of million  which includes million for employees from the intecap acquisition  an increase in legal  accounting  and professional fees of million  an increase in travel expenses of million  an increase in rent expense of million  which includes million from the intecap acquisition  and an increase in other selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary contributors to this increase were increases in legal and other professional fees  primarily due to sarbanes oxley section compliance costs and travel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an overall increase in revenue at a greater rate than the increases in other selling  general  and administrative expenses  including rent and other costs that are principally fixed in nature 
interest income 
interest income increased by  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this increase was due primarily to higher cash and investment balances in fiscal our weighted average imputed interest rate for fiscal on our average cash and cash equivalent balances was approximately compared with approximately in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased by million to million for fiscal from  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to interest expense incurred during fiscal on the million convertible debt and borrowings of million on our line of credit to finance the intecap acquisition 
other expense 
other expense decreased by  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal other expense consists primarily of foreign currency exchange transaction losses 
the decrease is primarily due to our hedging movements in exchange rates between the value of the dollar and foreign currencies 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the higher effective tax rate during fiscal is primarily due to losses not benefited in fiscal minority interest 
allocations of the minority share of neuco s net income result in deductions to our net income  while allocations of the minority share of neuco s net loss results in additions to our net income 
minority interest in the results of operations of neuco allocable to its other owners was net income of  in fiscal and net income of  in fiscal net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal diluted net income per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal net income increased at a greater rate than diluted net income per share primarily due to the dilutive impact of the increase in the number of outstanding in the money stock options and the public offering of our common stock completed in august  partially offset by a reduction in shares issued and outstanding resulting from our repurchase of shares with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of convertible bonds in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we experienced revenue increases in fiscal primarily in our chemicals and petroleum  materials and manufacturing  competition  finance  and energy and environment practice areas 
these increases were partially offset by a revenue decrease in our transportation practice area 
the increase in revenues was effected by an increase in utilization  increased billing rates for our employee consultants  an increase in the average number of employee consultants  and an increase in expenses billed to clients 
the total number of employee consultants decreased to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal however  the average number of our employee consultants for fiscal was higher than the average for fiscal  largely because the average for fiscal includes the employee consultants hired in connection with the acquisition of the cev business only for a portion of that year 
utilization was for fiscal as compared with for fiscal revenues derived from fixed price engagements increased to of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of the cev business in fiscal  which traditionally entered into fixed price engagements 
costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an overall increase in compensation expense for our employee consultants of million  an increase in reimbursable expenses billed to clients of million  and an increase of million attributable to an increase in the average number of employee consultants 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to increased leverage arising from higher utilization of our employee consultants 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in overall compensation to our administrative staff of million  an increase in commission payments to non employee experts of million  an increase in rent expense of million  and an increase in other selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary contributors to the decrease as a percentage of revenues were relative decreases in travel expenses  legal and other professional fees  as well as an overall increase in revenue at a greater rate than the increases in those selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include rent and other costs that are principally fixed in nature 
these decreases were partially offset by a revenue related increase in commission payments to non employee experts 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from foreign exchange losses and the overall decline in short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the slightly higher rate in fiscal was due primarily to a higher federal statutory rate because the growth in our net income pushed us into the top tax bracket 
minority interest 
minority interest in the results of operations of neuco changed to a profit of  in fiscal from a loss of  in fiscal due to an increase in profits in neuco 
net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal diluted net income per share increased by to per share from per share 
net income increased at a greater rate than diluted net income per share due to the dilutive impact of the additional shares issued as a result of the public offering of our common stock completed in august   the exercise of approximately thousand options during fiscal  and the increase in the number of outstanding in the money stock options 
liquidity and capital resources general 
in fiscal  we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
we completed the year with cash and cash equivalents of million  short term and long term investments of million  and working capital of million 
on november  we completed the acquisition of necg for approximately million valued as of the date of acquisition after deducting cash acquired  and adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid or accrued  consisting of million in cash and  restricted shares of our common stock valued at million 
on november   we completed the acquisition of tca for approximately million after adding a working capital adjustment  acquisition costs  and transaction fees paid or accrued 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash and  restricted shares of our common stock valued at million 
we funded the purchase price of the necg and tca acquisitions from existing cash resources 
on april   we completed the acquisition of intecap  inc we purchased intecap for approximately million after deducting cash acquired  and adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid or accrued 
we funded the purchase price from existing cash resources and borrowings of million under our line of credit 
on june   we completed a private placement of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due in on july   we sold an additional million in principal amount of these debentures 
we used the majority of the net proceeds from this offering to repay the amounts outstanding under the line of credit  to repurchase  shares of our common stock concurrently with the placement of the debentures  and to pay offering expenses 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds for working capital  general corporate purposes  and potentially for future acquisitions 
we believe that current cash balances  cash generated from operations  and amounts available under our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
sources of cash in fiscal during fiscal  we generated cash primarily from the following sources million in gross proceeds from the private placement of convertible debt  million in cash provided by our operating activities  and approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during this period  we also borrowed million under our line of credit and subsequently repaid this amount with proceeds of the convertible debt offering 
cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of million  which reflected depreciation and amortization expense of million  and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation for our employee consultants  most of which will be paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal private placement of convertible debt 
on june   we completed a private placement of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due on july   we sold an additional million in principal amount of the debentures 
holders of the debentures may convert them  as described below  only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter commencing after september   and before february   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the conversion price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  at any time on or after february  if the last reported sale price of our common stock on any date on or after february  is greater than or equal to of the conversion price  subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the debentures  during the five business day period after any three consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per debenture for each day of that period was less than of the product of the conversion rate and the last reported sale price of our common stock  if the debentures have been called for redemption by us  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions as set forth in the indenture governing the debentures  or if the debentures are rated by moody s investors service  inc or standard poor s rating services or both  at any time when i the long term credit rating assigned to the debentures by either rating agency is two or more levels below the credit rating initially assigned to the debentures or ii either rating agency has discontinued  withdrawn or suspended their ratings with respect to the debentures 
the debentures are our direct  unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior in right of payment to our existing bank line of credit and any future secured indebtedness that we may designate as senior indebtedness 
interest of approximately million is payable semi annually on june and december we will also be required to pay contingent interest on the applicable interest payment date to the holders of the debentures for the period commencing june   and ending december   if the average trading price of the debentures for each of the last five trading days immediately preceding june   equals or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
thereafter  we will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for a six month interest period if the average trading price of the debentures during the five trading day period immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
the contingent interest payable per debenture will equal of the average trading price of such debenture during the applicable five trading day reference period 
we may elect to redeem all or any portion of the debentures on or after june  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we may be required to repurchase all or any portion of the debentures  at the option of each holder  on june   june   june   june   and june   and upon certain specified fundamental changes  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon a fundamental change involving a change of control of cra  we may also be required to pay a make whole premium which in some cases could be substantial  which may be paid in cash  shares of common stock  or a combination thereof  to the holders of debentures who elect to require us to repurchase or convert debentures 
we have the right to settle all or a portion of the conversion of the debentures in cash in lieu of shares of common stock  provided that in no case except for cash in lieu of fractional shares shall the amount in cash we deliver exceed  per  principal amount of debentures converted  in which case any excess shall be paid in shares of our common stock 
on december   we have elected  contractually and irrevocably  to settle the par value of the debentures in cash 
as a result  upon a contingent conversion  we must settle the principal amount of our debentures in cash 
however  we may still elect to satisfy any conversion obligation that exceeds the principal amount of any converted debentures with either cash or shares of our common stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares 
we intend to use available cash and investment balances  cash from operations  amounts available under our bank line of credit  and alternative means of financing to meet this obligation 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase  shares of our common stock concurrently with the placement of the debentures  million to repay amounts outstanding under our bank line of credit  and million to pay offering expenses 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital  general corporate purposes  and potentially for future acquisitions 
we have classified our convertible debentures as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of november  there is no obligation to repay the debentures within a twelve month period following this date  and we cannot redeem the debentures until june  in addition the holders of the debentures cannot exercise an unrestricted option to convert until june   the stock price has not exceeded the per share contingent conversion price for out of consecutive trading days  ending on the last trading day of the preceding quarter  nor have other conversion triggers occurred 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
on january   we entered into a senior loan agreement with a bank for a two year  million revolving line of credit 
subject to the terms of the agreement  we may use borrowings under this line of credit for acquisition financing  working capital  general corporate purposes  letters of credit  and foreign exchanges contracts 
any borrowings under the line of credit must be repaid no later than january  the available line of credit is reduced  as necessary  to account for certain letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million 
in april  we borrowed million under our line of credit to finance the acquisition of intecap 
this amount was repaid in june other than for letters of credit outstanding  there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit as of november   and the line of credit then available was million 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  either at libor plus an applicable margin or at the prime rate 
applicable margins range from to  depending on the ratio of our consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  for the preceding four fiscal quarters  subject to various adjustments stated in the senior loan agreement 
these margins are adjusted both quarterly and each time we borrow under the credit facility 
for the borrowing period under the line of credit for the third quarter of fiscal  the average annual interest rate was 
interest is payable monthly 
a commitment fee of is payable on the unused portion of the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by of the stock of our us subsidiary cra security corporation and by of the stock of our foreign subsidiaries  amounting to net assets of approximately million as of november  in fiscal  we had a line of credit agreement that permitted borrowings of up to million with interest at the bank s base rate percent at november  
borrowings under the agreement were secured by our accounts receivable 
the terms of the line of credit included certain operating and financial covenants 
there were no borrowings outstanding as of november   and we terminated this line of credit in january debt restrictions 
under our senior credit agreement  we must comply with various financial and non financial covenants 
the financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum consolidated working capital of million and require us to comply with a consolidated total debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to and a consolidated senior debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to compliance with these financial covenants is tested on a fiscal quarterly basis  commencing with the first quarter of fiscal the non financial covenants of the senior credit agreement prohibit us from paying dividends and places restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  repurchase our securities  engage in acquisitions or dispositions  and enter into business combinations 
any indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility may become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of stated events of default  including our failure to pay principal  interest or fees or a violation of any financial covenant 
we obtained permission under our senior agreement to repurchase million of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal as of november   we were in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement 
other matters 
as part of our business  we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other consulting firms  practices or groups or other businesses 
in recent years  we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash  and we may continue to do so in the future 
to pay for an acquisition  we may use cash on hand  cash generated from our operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility  or we may pursue other forms of financing 
our ability to secure short term and long term debt or equity financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability  the levels of our debt and equity  restrictions under our existing line of credit and the overall credit and equity market environments 
in connection with our acquisition of intecap  certain intecap employees purchased an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for full recourse  interest bearing notes  maturing in june  totaling approximately million 
these notes are recorded as a reduction of stockholder s equity as of november  in connection with our acquisition of the consulting business of dr 
rausser  we loaned dr 
rausser million  which he used to purchase shares of our common stock 
in march  dr 
rausser satisfied million of the loan obligation by selling us  shares of our common stock and paying the balance in cash 
dr 
rausser satisfied the remaining million plus accrued interest in november by selling us an additional  shares of our common stock 
uses of cash in fiscal during fiscal  we used cash primarily for the following activities million after deducting cash acquired  and adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid to acquire intecap  million after deducting cash acquired  and adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid to acquire necg  and million after adding acquisition costs and transaction fees paid to acquire tca 
in addition  we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock concurrently with the placement of the debentures  and million for capital expenditures 
contingencies 
in connection with certain acquisitions completed in fiscal  we agreed to pay additional consideration  in cash and our stock  contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets by the respective acquired businesses 
we believe that we will have sufficient funds to satisfy any obligations related to the contingent consideration 
we expect to fund these contingent payments  if any  from existing cash resources and cash generated from operations 
impact of inflation 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
contractual obligations the following table presents information about our known contractual obligations as of november  it does not reflect contractual obligations that may have arisen or may arise after that date 
except for historical facts  the information in this section is forward looking information 
payments due by period contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after fiscal in thousands long term debt obligations notes payable to former stockholders convertible debentures payable deferred compensation total long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total as set forth in the indenture governing the convertible debentures  the debentureholder must wait until june to redeem the debentures and  in the absence of our stock price reaching per share for a specified period of time prior to june  to convert the debenture to our shares  with the principal amount of the debenture to be settled with cash 
in addition  interest of approximately million  is payable semi annually on june and december we will also be required to pay contingent interest on the applicable interest payment date to the holders of the debentures for the period commencing june   and ending december   if the average trading price of the debentures for each of the last five trading days immediately preceding june   equals or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
thereafter  we will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for a six month interest period if the average trading price of the debentures during the five trading day period immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
the contingent interest payable per debenture will equal of the average trading price of such debenture during the applicable five trading day reference period 
the necg and tca business acquisitions involve contingent consideration 
on a preliminary basis  we anticipate that any additional payments related to this contingency will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
payment of the additional consideration is generally contingent upon the acquired companies reaching certain revenue targets 
the milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from fiscal through fiscal since it is not possible to estimate if or when the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones  or the amount of contingent consideration based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
we have a revolving line of credit to borrow up to million 
we are party to standby letters of credit in support of the minimum future lease payments under leases for permanent office space amounting to million as of november  factors affecting future performance we depend upon only a few key employees to generate revenue our business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services  and accordingly  our success depends heavily on the efforts  abilities  business generation capabilities  and project execution capabilities of our employee consultants 
in particular  our employee consultants personal relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
if we lose the services of any employee consultant or if our employee consultants fail to generate business or otherwise fail to perform effectively  that loss or failure could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our employee consultants generated engagements that accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal our top five employee consultants generated approximately of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal we do not have non compete agreements with the majority of our employee consultants  and they can terminate their relationships with us at will and without notice 
the non competition and non solicitation agreements that we have with some of our employee consultants offer us only limited protection and may not be enforceable in every jurisdiction 
our failure to manage growth successfully could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations any failure on our part to manage growth successfully could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
over the last several years  we have continued to open offices in new geographic areas  including foreign locations  and to expand our employee base as a result of internal growth and acquisitions  including our recent acquisitions of necg  tca  and intecap 
we expect that this trend will continue over the long term 
opening and managing new offices often requires extensive management supervision and increases our overall selling  general  and administrative expenses 
expansion creates new and increased management  consulting  and training responsibilities for our employee consultants 
expansion also increases the demands on our internal systems  procedures  and controls  and on our managerial  administrative  financial  marketing  and other resources 
we depend heavily upon the managerial  operational  and administrative skills of our officers  particularly james c 
burrows  our president and chief executive officer  to manage our expansion 
new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect the overall quality of our work 
our entry into new lines of business could adversely affect our results of operations if we attempt to develop new practice areas or lines of business outside our core economic and business consulting services  those efforts could harm our results of operations 
our efforts in new practice areas or new lines of business involve inherent risks  including risks associated with inexperience and competition from mature participants in the markets we enter 
our inexperience may result in costly decisions that could harm our business 
clients can terminate engagements with us at any time many of our engagements depend upon disputes  proceedings  or transactions that involve our clients 
our clients may decide at any time to seek to resolve the dispute or proceeding  abandon the transaction  or file for bankruptcy 
our engagements can therefore terminate suddenly and without advance notice to us 
if an engagement is terminated unexpectedly  our employee consultants working on the engagement could be underutilized until we assign them to other projects 
in addition  because much of our work is project based rather than recurring in nature  our consultants utilization depends on our ability to secure additional engagements on a continual basis 
accordingly  the termination or significant reduction in the scope of a single large engagement could reduce our utilization and have an immediate adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we depend on our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions consulting business we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal  of our revenues in fiscal  and of our revenues in fiscal from engagements in our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions practice areas 
any substantial reduction in the number or size of our engagements in these practice areas could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we derived significant revenues from engagements relating to enforcement of united states antitrust laws 
changes in federal antitrust laws  changes in judicial interpretations of these laws  or less vigorous enforcement of these laws as a result of changes in political appointments or priorities or for other reasons could substantially reduce our revenues from engagements in this area 
in addition  adverse changes in general economic conditions  particularly conditions influencing the merger and acquisition activity of larger companies  could adversely affect engagements in which we assist clients in proceedings before the us department of justice and the us federal trade commission 
an economic slowdown may have an adverse effect on mergers and acquisitions activity  which would reduce the number and scope of our engagements in this practice area 
any such downturn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we derive our revenues from a limited number of large engagements we derive a portion of our revenues from a limited number of large engagements 
if we do not obtain a significant number of new large engagements each year  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could suffer 
our ten largest engagements accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal our ten largest clients accounted for approximately   and of our revenues in those years  respectively 
in general  the volume of work we perform for any particular client varies from year to year  and a major client in one year may not hire us again 
we enter into fixed price engagements we derive a significant portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts 
these contracts are more common in our business consulting practice  and would likely grow in number with any expansion of that practice 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources required for a fixed price project or fail to satisfy our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project budget  we might generate a smaller profit or incur a loss on the project 
on occasion  we have had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and we may have to take similar action in the future  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we are unable to hire additional qualified consultants as employees our business continually requires us to hire highly qualified  highly educated consultants as employees 
our failure to recruit and retain a significant number of qualified employee consultants could limit our ability to accept or complete engagements and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
relatively few potential employees meet our hiring criteria  and we face significant competition for these employees from our direct competitors  academic institutions  government agencies  research firms  investment banking firms  and other enterprises 
many of these competing employers are able to offer potential employees significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths  or geographic locations than we can 
competition for these employee consultants has increased our labor costs  and a continuation of this trend could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations 
we depend on our non employee experts we depend on our relationships with our exclusive non employee experts 
in fiscal and fiscal  six of our exclusive non employee experts generated engagements that accounted for approximately and of our revenues in those years  respectively 
we believe that these experts are highly regarded in their fields and that each offers a combination of knowledge  experience  and expertise that would be very difficult to replace 
we also believe that we have been able to secure some engagements and attract consultants in part because we could offer the services of these experts 
most of these experts can limit their relationships with us at any time for any reason 
these reasons could include affiliations with universities with policies that prohibit accepting specified engagements  the pursuit of other interests  and retirement 
as of november   we had non competition agreements with of our non employee experts 
the limitation or termination of any of their relationships with us  or competition from any of them after these agreements expire  could harm our reputation  reduce our business opportunities and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
to meet our long term growth targets  we need to establish ongoing relationships with additional non employee experts who have reputations as leading experts in their fields 
we may be unable to establish relationships with any additional non employee experts 
in addition  any relationship that we do establish may not help us meet our objectives or generate the revenues or earnings that we anticipate 
acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses 
the expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we acquire a business  such as our recent acquisitions of necg  tca  and intecap  we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own 
moreover  we may be unable to realize the financial  operational  and other benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions or any other acquisition 
competition for future acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks  such as charges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw  diversion of our management s time  attention  and resources  decreased utilization during the integration process  loss of key acquired personnel  increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial  operational  financial  and administrative systems including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  dilutive issuances of equity securities  including convertible debt securities  the assumption of legal liabilities  amortization of acquired intangible assets  potential write offs related to the impairment of goodwill  difficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures  and additional conflicts of interests 
our international operations create special risks we may continue our international expansion  and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial and business risks  including greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  cultural differences that result in lower utilization  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs  and other barriers  greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  longer sales cycles  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses  less stable political and economic environments  and civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity 
particularly as a result of our acquisition in may of certain assets of the uk operations of the chemical and energy practice of the then arthur d 
little corporation  we conduct a portion of our business in the middle east 
the ongoing military conflicts in the region have significantly interrupted our business operations in that region and have slowed the flow of new opportunities and proposals  which ultimately have adversely affected our revenues and results of operations 
if our international revenues increase relative to our total revenues  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our operating results 
our debt obligations may adversely impact our financial performance in june and july of  we issued a total of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due we have previously operated with little or no debt  and our previous payments of interest have not been material 
the interest we will be required to pay on these debentures will reduce our net income each year until the debentures are no longer outstanding 
the terms of the debentures also include provisions that could accelerate our obligation to repay all amounts outstanding under the debentures if certain events happen  such as our failure to pay interest in a timely manner  failure to pay principal upon redemption or repurchase  failure to deliver cash  shares of common stock  or other property upon conversion and other specified events of default 
in addition  on june   june   june   june  and june   or following specified fundamental changes holders of debentures may require us to repurchase their debentures for cash 
if any of these events were to happen  we do not presently have the financial resources to satisfy these obligations if they became due  and we would have to seek to refinance these obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain further financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
the terms of any such refinancing could be significantly less favorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
arthur d 
little  inc is now known as dehon  inc 
our clients may be unable to pay us for our services our clients include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties 
if a client s financial difficulties become severe  the client may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business  which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services 
on occasion  some of our clients have entered bankruptcy  which has prevented us from collecting amounts owed to us 
the bankruptcy of a client with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a small number of clients who have paid sizable invoices later declared bankruptcy  and a court determination that we were not properly entitled to that payment may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
if our revenues or net income in a quarter fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including the number of weeks in our fiscal quarter  the number  scope  and timing of ongoing client engagements  the extent to which we can reassign employee consultants efficiently from one engagement to the next  the extent to which our employee consultants take holiday  vacation  and sick time  employee hiring  the extent of fees discounting or cost overruns  fluctuations in revenues and results of operations of our software subsidiary  neuco  severe weather conditions and other factors affecting employee productivity  and collectibility of receivables and unbilled work in process 
because we generate the majority of our revenues from consulting services that we provide on an hourly fee basis  our revenues in any period are directly related to the number of our employee consultants  their billing rates  and the number of billable hours they work in that period 
we have a limited ability to increase any of these factors in the short term 
accordingly  if we underutilize our consultants during one part of a fiscal period  we may be unable to compensate by augmenting revenues during another part of that period 
in addition  we are occasionally unable to utilize fully any additional consultants that we hire  particularly in the quarter in which we hire them 
moreover  a significant majority of our operating expenses  primarily office rent and salaries  are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues fail to meet our projections in any quarter  that could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our net income 
for these reasons  we believe our historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
potential conflicts of interests may preclude us from accepting some engagements we provide our services primarily in connection with significant or complex transactions  disputes  or other matters that are usually adversarial or that involve sensitive client information 
our engagement by a client may preclude us from accepting engagements with the client s competitors or adversaries because of conflicts between their business interests or positions on disputed issues or other reasons 
accordingly  the nature of our business limits the number of both potential clients and potential engagements 
our recent acquisitions of necg  tca and intecap have significantly expanded our client base  which may increase the frequency with which we encounter conflicts of interest 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide consulting services  such as in the telecommunications industry  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of potential clients for our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to continue some of our ongoing engagements or accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interests 
maintaining our professional reputation is crucial to our future success our ability to secure new engagements and hire qualified consultants as employees depends heavily on our overall reputation as well as the individual reputations of our employee consultants and principal non employee experts 
because we obtain a majority of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients  any client that is dissatisfied with our performance on a single matter could seriously impair our ability to secure new engagements 
given the frequently high profile nature of the matters on which we work  any factor that diminishes our reputation or the reputations of any of our employee consultants or non employee experts could make it substantially more difficult for us to compete successfully for both new engagements and qualified consultants 
intense competition from other economic and business consulting firms could hurt our business the market for economic and business consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors 
in general  there are few barriers to entry into our markets  and we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the economic and business consulting industries 
in the legal and regulatory consulting market  we compete primarily with other economic and financial consulting firms and individual academics 
in the business consulting market  we compete primarily with other business and management consulting firms  specialized or industry specific consulting firms  the consulting practices of large accounting firms  and the internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
many of our competitors have national or international reputations as well as significantly greater personnel  financial  managerial  technical  and marketing resources than we do  which could enhance their ability to respond more quickly to technological changes  finance acquisitions  and fund internal growth 
some of our competitors also have a significantly broader geographic presence than we do 
our engagements may result in professional liability our services typically involve difficult analytical assignments and carry risks of professional and other liability 
many of our engagements involve matters that could have a severe impact on the client s business  cause the client to lose significant amounts of money  or prevent the client from pursuing desirable business opportunities 
accordingly  if a client is dissatisfied with our performance  the client could threaten or bring litigation in order to recover damages or to contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or otherwise breached our obligations to the client could expose us to significant liabilities and tarnish our reputation 
our reported earnings per share may be more volatile because of the accounting standards  rules  and regulations as they relate to our convertible senior subordinated debentures holders of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due may convert the debentures only under certain circumstances  including certain stock price related conversion contingencies 
under accounting regulations effective for periods through december   until the contingent conversion condition is met  any shares underlying our debentures are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
in september   the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a conclusion that  effective for periods ending after december   contingently convertible securities should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether a stock price related conversion contingency has been met 
under a proposed amendment to sfas no 
 in order to remain under the treasury stock method of accounting  issuers of debentures such as ours must contractually and irrevocably commit to settle the par value of the debentures in cash 
as of december   we have irrevocably elected to settle the par value of our debentures in cash 
as a result  upon a contingent conversion  we must settle the principal amount of our debentures in cash 
however  we may still elect to satisfy any conversion obligation that exceeds the principal amount of the debentures converted with either cash or shares of our common stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares 
we will continue to account for the debentures under the treasury stock method of accounting 
the treasury stock method of accounting allows us to report dilution only when and to the extent that our average stock price per share for the reporting period exceeds the conversion price 
for the first per share that our average stock price exceeds the conversion price of the debentures  we will include approximately  additional shares in our diluted share count 
for the second per share that our average stock price exceeds the conversion price  we will include approximately  additional shares in our diluted share count  and so on  with the additional shares dilution falling for each per share that our average stock price exceeds if the stock price rises further above see table  below 
treasury method of accounting for share dilution conversion price number of underlying shares formula number of extra dilutive shares created stock price conversion price underlying shares stock price condition only applies when share price exceeds stock price conversion price price difference include in share count per share dilution accordingly  volatility in our stock price could cause volatility in our reported diluted earnings per share 
we may not be able to deduct interest on our convertible senior subordinated debentures due to the potential application of certain us federal income tax laws  we may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the paid or accrued interest with respect to our convertible senior subordinated debentures in any given year in which the debentures remain outstanding 
the extent  if any  to which these restrictions would apply will not be finally determinable until we file our corporate income tax returns for cra and its subsidiaries for the current taxable year or possibly subsequent taxable years and are based on a number of factors  some of which are not within our control 
while we currently believe that none of these restrictions will apply to reduce the full amount of our deductions in fiscal  we cannot assure you that this will be the case for future fiscal years 
if we were unable to deduct all or any portion of the paid or accrued interest with respect to the debentures  our effective tax rate would increase and our cash flow and after tax operating results could be adversely affected 
the price of our common stock may be volatile our stock price has been volatile 
from november   to november   the trading price of our common stock ranged from to 
many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including variations in our quarterly results of operations  the hiring or departure of key personnel or non employee experts  changes in our professional reputation  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in accounting principles  changes in the legal and regulatory environment affecting clients  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  future sales of shares of common stock in the public market  and market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the time and attention of our management and other resources  or otherwise harm our business 
our charter and by laws and massachusetts law may deter takeovers our articles of organization and by laws and massachusetts law contain provisions that could have anti takeover effects and that could discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions  including the election of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of november   we were exposed to market risks  which primarily include changes in us interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of one year or less and a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of two years or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because these financial instruments are readily marketable  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates by settling material intercompany account balances and by hedging our foreign dollar positions with intercompany loans 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange agreements with banks or other financial institutions to hedge our exposure  but may do so in the future
