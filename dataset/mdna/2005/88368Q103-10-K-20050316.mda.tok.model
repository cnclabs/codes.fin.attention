overview history thestreet 
com  inc collectively  with its wholly owned subsidiaries  the company was organized in june as a delaware limited liability company and converted to a delaware c corporation in may the company operates its businesses in two segments  electronic publishing and securities research and brokerage 
the company s electronic publishing segment provides investment commentary  analysis and news to both retail and professional customers  which it distributes through its production of web sites  email reports and newsletters  syndicated radio programming  and conferences 
the electronic publishing segment receives revenue from subscription sales  advertising and sponsorship sales  as well as content syndication and conference attendees 
the company s securities research and brokerage segment provides proprietary equity research and brokerage services to institutional clients  and  as a broker dealer  receives revenue from trading commissions  a standard payment method in the professional markets 
in october  the company formed independent research group llc irg research  a delaware limited liability company  as a separate  wholly owned subsidiary to bring high quality  independent equity research to institutional clients 
in april  irg research was admitted to the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd as a broker dealer 
irg research established correspondent clearing relationships with two brokerage firms and began receiving commission revenue in may in january  irg research announced the commencement of in house equity trading operations on behalf of its clients 
current state of the company the company s total revenue for was million  an increase of over total revenue in of million 
net revenue for the fourth quarter was million  an increase of over fourth quarter net revenue of million 
for the second time in its history  the company earned a profit  reporting net income of  for the fourth quarter  as compared to a net profit of  for the fourth quarter approximately million  or  of the company s total revenue was received by its electronic publishing segment  which is operated through thestreet 
com  inc subscription revenue increased approximately year over year  to million in  as compared to million in advertising revenue increased approximately year over year  to million in  as compared to million in on the expense side  the company s electronic publishing segment s operating expenses increased approximately year over year  to million in  as compared to approximately million in the year over year revenue growth in the company s electronic publishing segment s subscription revenue was due in large part to the company s success in marketing its products to a wider audience and to its ability to sell higher priced products to its existing customers 
the company increased sales and marketing expenditures for its electronic publishing segment during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december   as it expanded its online direct response marketing efforts 
the marketing program involves the promotion of the company s consumer services via online direct response advertising  email marketing campaigns and co marketing agreements with a variety of popular financial web sites  both large and small 
although the resurgence in the online advertising market helps the company increase its advertising revenue  it has also made it more expensive to acquire new customers 
as a result  in  the company will seek to expand its use of co marketing arrangements that do not require up front customer acquisition expenditures 
the company s online advertising contracts generally have the short terms and early cancellation provisions typical of the industry  which enables the company to adjust its expenditures on a weekly or monthly basis  depending on the return on investment of the campaigns 
as a result of the foregoing  the company expects its sales and marketing expenditures to be flat or to increase slightly from levels 
the year over year increase in the electronic publishing segment s advertising revenue was primarily due to improvements in the online advertising market  the successful overall performance of advertising campaigns delivered by the company and the in house deployment of a dynamic advertisement serving capability that allowed the company to serve a variety of advertising formats 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of the previously mentioned increased online advertising costs  higher compensation  one time lease termination costs and consulting fees  partially offset by decreases in both depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation expenses 
the company s securities research and brokerage segment is operated through its wholly owned irg research subsidiary  which was created in the fourth quarter of since irg research was essentially a start up business in and began receiving revenue in may after its admission to the nasd as a broker dealer at the end of april  the segment incurred million in expenses and received only million in revenue in the year ended december  due to the expansion of its research  sales and marketing staffs in the year ended december  and the commencement in january of in house execution of client trades  irg research s revenues and expenses experienced significant growth  increasing to approximately million in revenue and million in expenses during the year ended december  the industry trend among large brokerage firms to reduce the size and expense of their research departments and the subsequent reduction of coverage of small capitalization stocks had led  for much of the past year  to greater availability of talented research analysts 
however  the company has recently seen competition for talented research analysts beginning to increase  leading to higher compensation costs 
notwithstanding the increased competition  the company currently intends to continue to devote resources to this segment  further increasing the staff of the firm s research analyst  sales and trading departments in order to grow revenue 
the company believes that  by focusing its services on small to mid capitalization stocks that have not been covered or have received limited coverage from traditional wall street firms  the company can become a preferred research resource and trading partner of hedge funds and buy side institutions that invest in smaller stocks 
the company also believes that the combination of fundamental and consultative research will help expand its customer base 
accordingly  the firm recently entered into an arrangement with mdrx financial  inc mdrx pursuant to which irg research will have the exclusive right to offer mdrx s innovative research to its institutional client base 
irg research also expects to provide its clients with proprietary retail pharmacy prescription and biotechnology data it believes is not currently available in the market on a cost effective basis 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash needs of both the company s electronic publishing segment and its securities research and brokerage segment for at least the next months 
see liquidity and capital resources 
discontinued operations in november  the company s board of directors decided to discontinue the company s uk operations 
on april   the final meeting of the members was held to bring the liquidation to a close 
a final return in the liquidation was filed on july  in order to formally dissolve the uk operations  and the dissolution became effective on october  subsequent events on january   the company announced the hiring of allen company llc allen  a new york investment bank  to assist its board of directors in considering possible strategic alternatives for enhancing stockholder value 
there is no definitive agreement with respect to  and no decision has been made as to whether the company will engage in  a transaction or transactions resulting from the board of directors consideration of strategic alternatives 
most of the consideration to be paid to allen is contingent upon the successful completion of a transaction 
effective january   the company established a retention program the program  pursuant to which each of certain eligible employees would receive retention benefits provided for under the program in the event of a change of control as defined in the program and termination benefits provided for under the program if his or her employment is terminated without cause as defined in the program or if such individual resigns for good reason as defined in the program in connection with a change of control 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions  specifically for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the useful lives of fixed assets  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and investments  as well as accrued expense estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates its revenue primarily from subscriptions  advertising  and commissions 
subscription revenue represents customer subscriptions that provide subscribers access to investment commentary  advice  analysis and news 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are charged directly to companies that subscribe to the service 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
the company calculates net subscription revenue by deducting refunds and cancellation chargebacks from gross revenue 
net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
deferred revenue liabilities relate to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized 
advertising revenue is derived from the sale of internet sponsorship arrangements and from the delivery of banner and email advertisements on the company s web sites  as well as from conference sponsorships  and is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
although infrequent  company obligations could include guarantees of a minimum number of times that users of the company s web sites click through to the advertisers web site  or take additional specified action  such as opening an account 
in such cases  revenue is recognized as the guaranteed click throughs or other relevant delivery criteria are fulfilled 
commission revenue arises from trades placed through the company s broker dealer subsidiary  or by cash payments in return for research provided  by its institutional clients 
commission revenue and related expenses are recognized on a trade date basis 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to james j 
cramer s daily radio program  realmoney with jim cramer  syndication revenue  conference attendee revenue  reprint revenue and  in  royalties earned from the company s investing book 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its advertisers to make required payments and for paid subscriptions that are cancelled and refunded or charged back by the subscriber 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
although results of prior estimates have generally been in line with management s expectations  should the financial condition of the company s advertisers and subscribers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets three years for computer equipment  including capitalized software and web site development costs  and five years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the respective lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
instead  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
upon the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of  the company stopped the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an indefinite life  and completed the required transitional fair value impairment test on its goodwill and certain other intangible assets  the results of which had no impact on the company s financial statements 
based upon annual impairment tests as of september  and  no impairment was indicated for the company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
business concentrations and credit risk financial instruments that subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  short term investments  and accounts receivable 
the company maintains all its cash and cash equivalents in four financial institutions 
the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions 
the company s customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations  generally does not require collateral  and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information 
to date  such losses have been within management s expectations 
stock based compensation the impact of stock based compensation expense based upon the fair value method has been significant to reported pro forma results of operations and per share amounts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of each option grant has been estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model and includes several assumptions  including the risk free interest rate and the expected volatility of the company s common stock price 
for each increase in the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated total pro forma expense for the year ended december  would increase by approximately  for each increase in the expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated total pro forma expense for the year ended december  would increase by approximately  because options are expensed over four years from the date of grant  the foregoing estimated increases include potential expense for options granted during the years ended december     and in calculating the amount of each variable that is included in the black scholes options pricing model ie  option exercise price  stock price  option term  risk free interest rate  annual dividend rate  and volatility  we used the weighted average of such variable for all grants issued in a given year 
legal contingencies on december   a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york naming as defendants thestreet 
com  inc  certain of its former officers and directors and james j 
cramer  a current director  and certain underwriters of the company s initial public offering the goldman sachs group  inc  chase h q  thomas weisel partners llc  fleetboston robertson stephens  and merrill lynch pierce fenner smith  inc 
plaintiffs allege that the underwriters of thestreet 
com  inc 
s initial public offering violated the securities laws by failing to disclose certain alleged compensation arrangements such as undisclosed commissions or stock stabilization practices in the offering s registration statement 
the plaintiffs seek damages and statutory compensation against each defendant in an amount to be determined at trial  plus pre judgment interest thereon  together with costs and expenses  including attorneys fees 
similar suits were filed against over other issuers that had initial public offerings between and december  and they have all been consolidated into a single action 
pursuant to a court order dated october   each of the individual defendants to the action has been dismissed without prejudice 
on june   the company and its individual defendants together with the company s insurance carriers entered into a settlement with the plaintiffs 
the settlement is subject to a hearing on fairness and approval by the court overseeing the litigation 
although the lawsuit against the company is an independent cause of action vis a vis the lawsuits pending against other issuers in the consolidated proceeding  and no issuer is liable for any wrongdoing allegedly committed by any other issuer  the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers is being done on a collective basis and includes all but one of the issuer defendants eligible to participate 
generally  under the terms of the settlement  in exchange for the delivery by the insurers of the company and the other defendants of an undertaking guaranteeing that the plaintiffs will recover  in the aggregate  billion from the underwriters the recovery deficit  and the assignment to the plaintiffs by the issuers of their interests in claims against the underwriters for excess compensation in connection with their ipos  the plaintiffs will release the non bankrupt issuers from all claims against them the bankrupt issuers will receive a covenant not to sue and their individual defendants 
the recovery deficit payable by the insurers to the plaintiffs will be equal to the difference  if any  between billion and the actual amount the plaintiffs recover from the underwriters by reason of the ipo litigation and the assigned claims 
neither the company nor any other issuer will be required to pay any portion of the recovery deficit  if any  and the insurers will cover all further legal defense costs incurred by the issuers  as well as notice costs and administrative costs and expenses 
pursuant to an opinion and order dated february   the settlement was preliminarily approved by the court  subject to certain minor modifications 
in the event the settlement does not receive final court approval and the company or any of its individual defendants is reinstated as a defendant in the lawsuit  any unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows

these gains were partially offset by increased levels of spending due to the following increased sales and marketing expenditures for the electronic publishing segment resulting in the increased amount of subscription revenue  the continued expansion of irg research s operations  which resulted in higher overall expense  and thestreet 
com  inc s higher level of incentive compensation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its market risk exposures are immaterial as the company does not have instruments for trading purposes  and reasonable possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings  material changes in fair values or cash flows for all instruments 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following material risks facing the company 
if any of the following risks occur  the company s business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company has a history of losses and may incur further losses although the company earned net income of  or per share  in the fourth quarter of and  or per share  in the fourth quarter of  the company has incurred operating losses in all other fiscal quarters since its formation  and may continue to experience operating losses in the future 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company will need to generate significant revenue in order to cover the significant operating expenses it expects to incur during fiscal accordingly  the company can make no assurances that it will be able to achieve profitability  under us generally accepted accounting principles  on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company s quarterly financial results may fluctuate and its future revenue is difficult to forecast the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control  including the level of interest and investment in the stock market by both individual and institutional investors  demand for advertising on the company s web sites  which is affected by seasonal weakness in the first and third quarters  advertising budget cycles of our customers  and the demand for advertising on the internet generally  subscription price reductions attributable to decreased demand or increased competition  new products or services introduced by the company s competitors  content distribution fees or other costs incurred by the company  costs associated with system downtime affecting the internet generally or the company s web sites in particular  and general economic and market conditions 
although we generated net income in the fourth quarters of and  you should not rely on the results for those periods as an indication of future performance 
the company forecasts its current and future expense levels based on expected revenue and the company s operating plans 
because of the above factors  as well as other material risks facing the company  as described elsewhere in this report  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarters 
in such an event  the price of the company s common stock is likely to decline 
a significant portion of the company s subscription revenue is generated by james j 
cramer and other key writers the company believes it has significantly enhanced its subscription offerings to differentiate them from other financial and investing products available in the marketplace  having introduced  in recent years  publications containing a broad variety of features from a multitude of contributors  as well as more narrowly targeted  trading oriented newsletters  some of which are the work of an individual writer 
while the company believes that the success of its publications is dependent in part upon its brands  some of these publications  particularly the newsletters  nonetheless reflect the talents  efforts  personalities and reputations of their respective writers 
as a result  the services of these key writers  particularly company co founder james j 
cramer  form an essential element of our subscription revenues 
accordingly  the company seeks to compensate and provide incentives for these key writers through competitive salaries  stock ownership and bonus plans  and has entered into employment agreements with several of them  including mr 
cramer  whose current employment agreement will expire on july  however  the company can make no assurances that these programs will enable it to retain key writers or  should the company lose the services of one or more of its key writers to death  disability  loss of reputation or other reason  to attract new writers acceptable to readers of the company s publications 
the loss of services of one or more of the company s key writers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of the services of other key employees could affect the company s business the company s continued success also depends upon the retention of other key employees  including executives to operate its business  technology personnel to run its publishing  commerce  communications and other systems  and salespersons to sell its subscription products and its advertising space 
in addition  the success of the company s proprietary equity research business  operated through independent research group llc irg research  its broker dealer subsidiary  depends on its executives  as well as research analysts and traders 
several of the company s key employees are bound by employment or non competition agreements 
in addition  the company seeks to compensate its key executives  as well as other employees  through competitive salaries  stock ownership and bonus plans 
finally  in connection with the company s announcement that it has retained the investment bank allen company llc allen to assist its board of directors in considering possible strategic alternatives  the company has established a retention program under which eligible employees would receive certain benefits in the event of a change of control of the company 
nevertheless  the company can make no assurances that these programs will allow it to retain key employees or hire new employees 
the loss of one or more of the company s key employees  or the company s inability to attract experienced and qualified replacements  could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with its proprietary equity research business  which is in the early stages of development in october  the company formed irg research as a wholly owned subsidiary to operate its proprietary equity research business 
irg research began coverage of equities in the second quarter of  when it became a registered broker dealer 
although irg research recorded full year revenue of approximately million  it recorded full year expenses of million including million allocated to it under its services agreement with thestreet 
com  inc and remains in the early stages of development 
as the company develops and operates this emerging business  the company will continue to encounter risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties relating to the attraction and retention of talented analysts and other staff  regulatory compliance  brand development  market acceptance of its products  trading errors  and the strength of the market for equity securities and equity research overall  among others 
the limited operating history of irg research makes it difficult to evaluate the business and its prospects or to accurately predict future revenue or results of operations for the business 
accordingly  the prospects for this business should be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development 
the company can make no assurances that it will successfully develop and operate its proprietary equity research business or achieve profitability for this business 
irg research s revenue may not be sufficient to cover its expenses irg research s current business plan involves the production of proprietary equity research  the marketing of investment analysis and research products produced by thestreet 
com and selected other third party providers  and the dissemination of the foregoing to institutional money managers and hedge funds at no charge to these customers 
most recently  irg has entered into an agreement with a pharmaceutical and healthcare research provider  pursuant to which irg research will have the exclusive right to offer the provider s research to its institutional client base 
in return  irg research expects that these institutional money managers and hedge funds will voluntarily pay for this research by subscription or  using so called soft dollars  by electing to execute transactions through the firm 
see business electronic publishing segment professional products sales and marketing soft dollar brokers and business securities research and brokerage segment sales and marketing 
however  there is no guarantee that these activities will generate sufficient revenue to cover the firm s expenses 
furthermore  in response to the recent mutual fund scandal  several members of congress have introduced mutual fund reform legislation that could  if passed  affect the use of soft dollars to pay for research services 
see government regulation and legal uncertainties securities industry regulation 
the company may have difficulty increasing its advertising revenue  a significant portion of which is concentrated among the company s top advertisers the company s ability to increase its advertising revenue depends on a variety of factors  including general market conditions  seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage  the company s ability to increase its unique visitors and page view inventory  and the company s ability to win its share of advertisers total advertising budgets from other web sites  television  radio and print media 
if the company s advertising revenue decreases because of these factors  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s top five advertisers accounted for approximately of its total advertising revenue  as compared to approximately for the third quarter of and approximately for the fourth quarter of  excluding conference sponsorship revenue 
furthermore  although the company continues to work to attract advertisers from outside the financial services industry  such as automotive and luxury goods  a large proportion of the company s top advertisers are concentrated in financial services  particularly in the online brokerage business 
if these industries were to weaken significantly  or if other factors caused the company to lose a number of its top advertisers  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as is typical in the advertising industry  the company s advertising contracts have short notice cancellation provisions 
intense competition could reduce the company s market share and harm its financial performance the company s ability to compete successfully depends on many factors  including the quality and timeliness of its content and that of the company s competitors  the success of the company s recommendations and research  the company s ability to introduce products and services that keep pace with new investing trends  the ease of use of services developed either by the company or its competitors and the effectiveness of the company s sales and marketing efforts 
in our electronic publishing segment  we face competition for customers  advertisers  employees and contributors from a wide variety of financial news and information sources  as well as other types of companies  including online business  finance or investing web sites  publishers and distributors of traditional media focused on finance and investing  including print publications and radio and television programs  and investment newsletter publishers 
our securities research and brokerage segment  as well as the advisory services portion of our electronic publishing segment  also faces significant competition from a different set of competitors  including established wall street investment banking firms  large financial institutions  equity research boutiques  and other securities professionals that offer similar information and that have firmly established customer relationships 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company does 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
accordingly  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to compete effectively with its current or future competitors or that this competition will not significantly harm its business 
the company faces risks associated with the growth and diversification of its business the company s business has grown and diversified in recent years and now includes a variety of professional and consumer subscription products  as well as a separate  wholly owned  broker dealer subsidiary  which offers proprietary equity research and trading to its institutional clients 
we intend to continue to grow and diversify our business  both organically and possibly through acquisitions of other companies 
such growth and diversification may require significant time and resource commitments from the company s senior management  which will limit the amount of time these individuals will have available to devote to the company s existing operations 
growth in diversity and complexity may also impact our evolving business in ways we have not anticipated 
the efficient operation of the company will depend on our ability to successfully manage the increasing complexity of the commerce  publishing  financial reporting  and other systems we depend on 
acquisitions by the company could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and the issuance of new equity or debt securities to pay for acquisitions would dilute the holdings of existing stockholders 
any failure or any inability to effectively manage and integrate the growth and diversification of the company could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
system failure may result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation the company s ability to provide timely  updated information depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems 
similarly  the company s ability to track  measure and report the delivery of advertisements on its web sites depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a third party system 
the company s operations depend in part on the protection of its data systems and those of its third party provider against damage from human error  natural disasters  fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failure  computer viruses  acts of terrorism  vandalism  sabotage  and similar unexpected adverse events 
although the company utilizes the services of a third party data center host and has put in place certain other disaster recovery measures  there is no guarantee that the company s internet access and other data operations will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in the company s service or a decrease in responsiveness of its web sites could result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation  brand and the company s relations with its advertisers and strategic partners 
the company s insurance policies may not adequately compensate the company for such losses 
in such event  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties in new product development could harm the company s business in the past few years  the company has introduced a significant number of new products and services  and expects to continue to do so 
however  the company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent it from introducing new products and services in the future  or cause the costs to be higher than anticipated  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have also invested significant resources to enhance the design  production and distribution of our products  and to accommodate the high volume of traffic we often receive as a result of important financial news events 
nevertheless  the company s web sites and distributed products have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  publishing problems  slower response times or other problems for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences could cause the company s readers to choose other methods to obtain their financial and investment commentary  analysis and news 
in such a case  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
failure to establish and maintain successful strategic relationships with other companies could decrease the company s subscriber and reader base the company still relies on establishing and maintaining successful strategic relationships with other companies to attract and retain a portion of its current subscriber and reader base 
there is intense competition for relationships with these firms and for content placement on their web sites  and the company may have to pay significant fees to establish additional relationships with large  high traffic partners or maintain existing relationships in the future 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with advertisers that require us to exclusively feature these parties in sections of our web sites 
existing and future exclusivity arrangements may prevent us from entering into other advertising or sponsorship arrangements or other strategic relationships 
additionally  the company s irg research subsidiary has begun to develop relationships with third party providers of data and consultative research in order to broaden the research and brokerage services it offers to its clients 
for example  irg research recently entered into an agreement with mdrx financial  inc  a pharmaceutical and healthcare research provider mdrx  pursuant to which irg research has agreed to pay a fee for the exclusive right to offer mdrx s innovative research to its institutional client base 
however  there can be no assurance that this initiative will result in revenue gains 
if the company s operating units do not successfully establish and maintain its strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if these relationships do not attract significant revenue  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties associated with the company s brand development may harm its ability to attract subscribers the company believes that maintaining and growing awareness about its products is an important aspect of its efforts to continue to attract users 
the company s new products do not have widely recognized brands  and the company will need to increase awareness of these brands among potential users 
additionally  irg research  the company s broker dealer subsidiary  does not have a widely recognized brand 
the company s efforts to build brand awareness may not be cost effective or successful in reaching potential users  and some potential users may not be receptive to the company s marketing efforts or advertising campaigns 
accordingly  the company can make no assurances that such efforts will be successful in raising awareness of thestreet 
com  realmoney  street insight  action alerts plus  thestreet 
com stocks under or other brands or in persuading potential users to subscribe to the company s products or potential clients to utilize the equity research and trading services of irg research 
failure to maintain the company s reputation for trustworthiness may harm its business it is very important that the company maintain its reputation as a trustworthy organization 
the occurrence of events  including the company s misreporting a news story  the non disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of the company s writers  the manipulation of a security by one or more of the company s outside contributors  or other breach of the company s compliance policies  could harm the company s reputation for trustworthiness and reduce readership 
these events could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may face liability for  or incur costs to defend  information published in its products the company may be subject to claims for defamation  libel  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information the company publishes in its products 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as other print publications in the past 
the company could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from its web sites through links to other web sites 
the company s insurance may not adequately protect it against these claims 
the company may not adequately protect its own intellectual property and may incur costs to defend against  or face liability for  intellectual property infringement claims of others to protect the company s rights to its intellectual property  the company relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with its employees  affiliates  customers  strategic partners and others 
additionally  we aggressively police internet message boards and other web sites for copyrighted content that has been republished without our permission 
the protective steps the company has taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information 
the company may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  its intellectual property rights 
the company has registered several trademarks in the united states and also has pending us applications for other trademarks 
failure to adequately protect the company s intellectual property could harm its brand  devalue its proprietary content and affect its ability to compete effectively 
in addition  although the company believes that its proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against the company or claims that the company has violated a patent or infringed a copyright  trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them 
the company incorporates licensed third party technology in some of its services 
in these license agreements  the licensors have generally agreed to defend  indemnify and hold the company harmless with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right 
the company cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect it from infringement claims 
protecting the company s intellectual property rights  or defending against infringement claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on the company s part  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation and legal uncertainties internet communications  commerce and privacy regulation 
the growth and development of the market for internet commerce and communications has prompted both federal and state laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information including consumer credit and financial information under the gramm leach bliley act  consumer protection  the content of online publications  the taxation of online transactions and the transmission of unsolicited commercial email  popularly known as spam 
more laws and regulations are under consideration by various governments  agencies and industry self regulatory groups 
although the company s compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on it  new laws and regulations may be introduced and modifications to existing laws may be enacted that require the company to make changes to its business practices 
on january   the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of  also known as the can spam act of  became effective 
this federal law pre empted the even more rigorous state anti spam statute passed by california in september  and established uniform standards  penalties  and an enforcement regime for the sending of unsolicited commercial email 
although the company believes that its practices are in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and policies  if the company were required to defend its practices against investigations of state or federal agencies or if the company s practices were deemed to be violative of applicable laws  regulations or policies  the company could be penalized and its activities enjoined 
any of the foregoing could increase the cost of conducting online activities  decrease demand for the company s products and services  lessen the company s ability to effectively market its products and services  or otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
securities industry regulation 
the company s activities have evolved to include  among other things  the offering of stand alone products providing stock recommendations and analysis to subscribers  in contrast to providing such information as part of a larger online financial publication of more general and regular circulation 
as a result  the company registered in with the sec as an investment advisor under the investment advisers act of in addition  irg research has registered with the sec and been admitted as a member of the nasd as a broker dealer in connection with its activities as a broker dealer and provider of proprietary and third party research 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
a failure to comply with regulations applicable to securities industry participants could materially and adversely affect the company s and irg research s business  results of operations and financial condition 
investment advisors such as thestreet 
com are subject to sec regulations covering all aspects of the operation of their business  including  among others advertising  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of advisory activities 
likewise  broker dealers such as irg research are subject to regulations of the sec  state regulators and self regulatory organizations  such as the nasd  covering all aspects of the operation of their business  including  among others recommendations of securities  equity research  execution of customers orders  capital structure  record keeping  advertising  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of securities and research activities 
violations of the regulations governing the actions of investment advisors and broker dealers may result in the imposition of censures or fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a firm  its officers  or its employees from the securities business 
the company s ability to comply with all applicable securities laws and rules is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of appropriate compliance systems including proper supervisory procedures and books and records requirements  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
furthermore  because the company operates in industries subject to extensive regulation  new regulation  changes in existing regulation  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules can have a significant impact on the company s ability to compete in the securities industry 
for example  the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and other actions by various regulatory authorities and industry organizations imposed significant new requirements on broker dealers and securities analysts issuing research reports on equity securities and their supervisors 
the requirements include an obligation to disclose conflicts and prohibitions designed to promote objectivity and independence of securities analysts 
to date  irg research has not experienced any material adverse effect as a result of these requirements  and the company does not expect any such material adverse effect on the growth and development of irg research 
additionally  the recent scandal over late trading and market timing in the mutual fund industry has intensified regulatory scrutiny of trading and other practices of mutual funds  including the use of soft dollars to pay for research 
soft dollar practices evolved after the passage of an amendment to the exchange act that permitted money managers  so long as they followed certain rules  to pay commission rates that were higher than the lowest available rates  in exchange for research products to assist them in the performance of their investment decision making responsibilities  without violating their fiduciary duty to clients to obtain the best possible execution at the lowest commission rate available 
since then  there have been sporadic efforts by regulators and industry reformers to curb or abolish the practice  which some money managers use to pay for products and services that do not fall within the rules  in potential breach of this duty 
as a result  although the mutual fund scandal has little to do with soft dollar practices  in late and  five mutual fund industry reform bills were introduced in the th congress 
of these  four would impose additional disclosure requirements on mutual funds and their investment advisers concerning their usage of brokerage commission payments  and one  the mutual fund reform act of  would prohibit altogether the use of soft dollars by mutual funds to pay for third party research 
the company believes that the proprietary and third party research products currently offered by irg research to its clients are purely research  and thus  in the company s view  their use by money managers is comfortably within current interpretations of the scope of the regulatory safe harbor for lawful and appropriate use of commissions 
however  the passage of any new or currently proposed legislation that significantly curbed or abolished soft dollar practices  or action by the sec or other federal and state governmental regulatory authorities or self regulatory organizations to further regulate the activities of broker dealers and investment advisors in general  could affect the company s business in the future in a manner that could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any failure of the company s internal security measures or breach of its privacy protections could cause the company to lose users and subject it to liability users who subscribe to the company s subscription based products are required to furnish certain personal information including name  mailing address  phone number  email address and credit card information  which the company uses to administer its services 
the company also requires users of some of its free products and features to provide the company with some personal information during the membership registration process 
additionally  the company relies on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real time credit card authorization and verification  and at times relies on third parties  including technology consulting firms  to help protect its infrastructure from security threats
