because of these and other factors affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
overview hei has been in a turnaround mode since mid year of fiscal when new management was brought in 
the turnaround plan began with the financial restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness 
next  management focused on the sales process  with a target of more programs for existing customers and new programs with new customers 
the success in bringing in these new customers and new programs exposed production problems from years of operational neglect under former management 
during fiscal we consistently under delivered against orders we had from our customers 
we made a strategic decision to sacrifice profits in order to keep our customers as satisfied as possible  while improvements were made to our operations 
we lost no customers during fiscal  despite our production problems 
in fiscal revenues 
table of contents increased over fiscal and gross profits increased as a result of the new initiatives that have been put in place over the past two years to expand sales  diversify our customer base and improve the throughput and efficiency of our manufacturing facilities 
as a result  we achieved operating income in fiscal of as compared with an operating loss of  in fiscal for the year ended august   our net income was versus a net loss of  in fiscal we have also taken steps to improve our liquidity and financial condition during fiscal  primarily through the completion of the sale of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock which provided the company with approximately million of gross proceeds 
the proceeds of this offering were used to repay our line of credit and facilitate our ability to fund investments in working capital and new equipment for our manufacturing facilities 
during the year we also expanded the availability under our line of credit to million 
we have continued to utilize this facility to fund necessary operating and capital requirements 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from reported results 
revenue recognition  sales returns and warranty revenue for manufacturing and assembly contracts is generally recognized upon shipment to the customer which represents the point at which the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
we have a limited number of customer arrangements with customers which require that we retain ownership of inventory until it has been received by the customer  until it is accepted by the customer  or in one instance  until the customer places the inventory into production at its facility 
there are no additional obligations or other rights of return associated with these agreements 
accordingly  revenue for these arrangements is recognized upon receipt by the customer  upon acceptance by the customer or when the inventory is utilized by the customer in its manufacturing process 
our amo provides service contracts for some of its products 
billings for services contracts are based on published renewal rates and revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
our amo s development contracts are discrete time and materials projects that generally do not involve separate deliverables 
development contract revenue is recognized ratably as development activities occur based on contractual per hour and material reimbursement rates 
development contracts are an interactive process with customers as different design and functionality is contemplated during the design phase 
upon reaching the contractual billing maximums  we defer revenue until contract extensions or purchase orders are received from customers 
we occasionally have contractual arrangements in which part or all of the payment or billing is contingent upon achieving milestones or customer acceptance 
for those contracts we evaluate whether the contract should be accounted using the completed contract method  as the term of the arrangement is short term  or using the percentage of completion method for longer term contracts 
we have not entered into any significant fixed fee development arrangements or contracts using the percentage of completion method since we acquired our amo 
we may establish one or more contractual relationships with one customer that involves multiple deliverables including development  manufacturing and service 
each of these deliverables may be considered a separate unit of accounting and we evaluate if each element has sufficient evidence of fair value to allow separate revenue recognition 
if we cannot separately account for the multiple elements in an arrangement  we 
table of contents may be required to account for the arrangement as one unit of accounting with recognition over an extended period of time or upon delivery of all of the contractual elements 
we record provisions against net sales for estimated product returns 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in the demands of our customers 
provisions are also recorded for warranty claims that are based on historical trends and known warranty claims 
should actual product returns exceed estimated allowances  additional reductions to our net sales would result 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we estimate the collectability of trade receivables and note receivables  which requires considerable amount of judgment in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectability of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and  if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances for uncollectible accounts 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on changes in estimates from our actual collection experience 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
generally  all inventory purchases are for customized parts for customer specific programs 
contractual arrangements are typically agreed to with the customer prior to ordering customized parts as often times the parts cannot be consumed in other programs 
even though contractual arrangements may be in place  we are still required to assess the utilization of inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  judgments as to future demand requirements are made and compared to the current or committed inventory levels and contractual inventory holding requirements 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
it is possible that significant charges to record inventory at the lower of cost or market may occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
long lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision  or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when deemed necessary  we complete this evaluation by comparing the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
if such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values 
we assess the impairment of our manufacturing equipment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of our assets or our overall business strategy  significant negative market or economic trends  and 
table of contents significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period changing our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
in fiscal and  our operating losses related to the assets in the microelectronics group created a trigger event for further analysis of the recoverability of our long lived assets in that group 
in fiscal  this analysis included an independent valuation by a third party in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company utilized all of the accumulated information and determined that it was necessary to record an impairment charge of in fiscal and in fiscal there was no triggering event in fiscal asset impairment evaluations are by nature highly subjective 
valuation of deferred taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we record a current provision for income taxes based on amounts payable or refundable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period 
we recognize a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that deferred assets are not recoverable 
at august  and  we had valuation allowances of approximately  and  respectively  because of uncertainties related to the ability to utilize certain federal and state net loss carryforwards due to our historical losses and net tax operating loss carryforward position 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets are recoverable 
purchase accounting the accompanying statements reflect the allocation of the purchase price of our amo see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this allocation included an accrual of related to an unfavorable operating lease   for future estimated lease payments and a accrual to fulfill estimated contractual manufacturing obligations 
the  accrued for estimated lease payments consists of  for future lease obligations less estimated sublease payments of  on  square feet of unoccupied space 
in april  the company entered into an agreement to sub lease approximately  square feet of vacant space in this facility 
this is a ten year lease which provides for rental payments and reimbursement of operating costs 
aggregate annual rental and operating cost payments to be received by the company following a nine month free rent period  will be approximately 
million 
we are continuing to look for sublease tenants for the remaining  square feet of vacant space 
in our opinion  all adjustments necessary to present fairly such financial statements have been made based on the terms and structure of the acquisition of our amo 

table of contents results of operations percentage of net sales fiscal year ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research  development and engineering other the following table illustrates the approximate percentage of our net sales by market served 
fiscal year ended august  market medical hearing communications industrial net sales net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from sales of  in fiscal this increase was driven by increases in sales in our primary markets of medical hearing and communications products and improvements in our manufacturing capabilities to produce and ship more products 
our microelectronic operations achieved sales of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal or an increase of 
sales at our amo operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal or a increase 
the improvements in our manufacturing processes and growth in orders from existing customers were the primary drivers for the increases in sales at the microelectronics unit 
at our amo operations  the increase in sales is due to increases in engineering and software related services for our customers 
our net sales for fiscal  increased  or  compared to fiscal amo s net sales increased  in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal the increase in amo net sales was largely due to the inclusion of twelve months of net sales from our amo in fiscal compared to only seven months of net sales from our amo being included in fiscal the increase in amo net sales was partially offset by declines in net sales generated by the microelectronics operations caused by the inability to ship against outstanding orders 
net sales to medical hearing customers represented  and of total net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increased sales to long term customers as supplemented by new customer and new programs with existing customers 
fiscal results included increased demand for implantable medical devices like cochlear implants  insulin pumps and defibrillators for our microelectronics operations 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily a result of the acquisition of our advanced medical operations in january and the inclusion of twelve months of net sales from our amo in fiscal net sales to the communications market increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal or an increase of 
this increase is the result of targeted marketing efforts initiated in prior years to focus on niche customers in these markets 
sales efforts to these customers resulted in incremental revenues in fiscal and we benefited from a general expansion of the global communications markets 
sales to this market 
table of contents decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  or or a decrease 
the fiscal decrease as compared to fiscal is a result of the weakness in the telecommunications markets 
net sales to the industrial markets includes sales of rfid products 
sales in the industrial area increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  or an increase in net sales 
this increase was driven by an increase in orders from a major customer as well as from sales to several new customers as increased focus on this market has resulted in improved sales opportunities 
rfid sales improved in fiscal over fiscal during which sales were  primarily due to increases in sales to one major customer 
at august   our backlog of orders for revenue was approximately million  compared to approximately million and million at august  and  respectively 
we expect to ship our backlog as of august  during fiscal this small decrease in backlog is reflective of a change in the way our customers do business in that they are more unwilling to make commitments too far into the future 
the backlog from our amo includes customer commitments that have longer terms  as compared to our historical customer commitments 
our backlog is not necessarily a firm commitment from our customers and can change  in some cases materially  beyond our control 
because our sales are generally tied to the customers projected sales and production of the related product  our sales levels are subject to fluctuations beyond our control 
to the extent that sales to any one customer represent a significant portion of our sales  any change in the sales levels to that customer can have a significant impact on our total sales 
in addition  production for one customer may conclude while production for a new customer has not yet begun or is not yet at full volume 
these factors may result in significant fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal as compared with in fiscal as compared to in fiscal during fiscal  the microelectronics operations experienced production difficulties that resulted in shipment delays  excessive overtime costs and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
the production delays were due to the number of new programs initiated at the same time and the increased complexities of many of the new product offerings 
a number of initiatives to correct these problems were implemented in fiscal and as a result  we realized improved yields  reduced scrap  and reduced overtime in our manufacturing department 
another primary reason for the improvement in our profit margins is that we were able to reduce the time to manufacture products during the year and thereby spread our fixed manufacturing costs over a larger amount of products 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin is due to the problems encountered in fiscal described above 
our gross margins are heavily impacted by fluctuations in net sales  due to the fixed nature of many of our manufacturing costs  and by the mix of products manufactured in any particular quarter 
in addition  the start up of new customer programs could adversely impact our margins as we implement the complex processes involved in the design and manufacture of ultra miniature microelectronic devices 
we anticipate that our gross profit margins will remain relatively constant over the near term 
we continue to work to improve our process which we believe will enable us to see improved gross profit margins in the future 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in total were of net sales in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales was due to the significant increase in revenue in fiscal which was achieved while expense remained relatively the same as in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased when compared to fiscal growing to  from  the increase is due to increases in sales costs such as commissions and travel that related to the increase in sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the 
table of contents additional cost was mainly due to from increases in sales related expenses to expand the sales effort and additional legal and professional fees of due to efforts to consummate a new lease of our boulder facility and to pursue the debt owed to us by cmed 
research  development  and engineering expenses research  development  and engineering expenses were  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal or an increase of this increase reflects additional engineering activities to improve manufacturing processes and design and development work associated with new customer programs 
as a percentage of net sales  research  development and engineering expenses decreased to of sales from in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal by this was due to development work that was performed to advance the link it technology 
we expect that research  development and engineering costs will increase slightly in fiscal as we increase our engineering activities to improve our operating efficiencies 
gain on settlement during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement related to an outstanding claim against the seller of the amo operations that we acquired in january the net effect of this settlement  after offsetting legal and other related costs  was a gain of all the cash related to this settlement was received in the third quarter of fiscal unusual charges the unusual charges of  in fiscal relate to in legal and professional fees for the special investigation of the activities of mr 
fant  our former chief executive officer  president and chairman and of asset impairment charges related to the equipment in our microelectronics operations 
our evaluation  in fiscal  of the historical losses from our microelectronics group created a trigger for further impairment analysis 
our long lived assets relating to our microelectronics operations were valued by an independent third party valuation firm and resulted in an impairment charge of in fiscal the unusual charges of in fiscal also relates to the impairment of equipment 
the asset impairment in fiscal was triggered by the development of alternative testing that was more efficient than what could be performed by our existing equipment and notification in the same quarter that a large portion of a significant customer program would be moved offshore in the first quarter of fiscal other income expense  net interest expense for fiscal was as compared with in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is due to higher average borrowing levels associated with funding the growth in our working capital requirements 
as a result of the increase in sales levels in fiscal  we have had increases in both accounts receivable and inventories  which have been funded by additional borrowings on our credit agreement 
in fiscal  other income also included a gain on recoveries on a previously written off note receivable of approximately and a gain of related to additional cash collections against the outstanding judgments against mr 
fant 
other income of  in fiscal improved  from fiscal the fiscal increase was due primarily to income related to the cash collected against the outstanding judgment against mr 
fant of  and a non cash gain associated with the prepayment of a promissory note 
other expenses of  in fiscal related to the non cash write off of deferred financing bank fees of related to the terminated revolving line of credit with lasalle business credit  llc  and establishment of a reserve of for mr 
fant s promissory note and other amounts that were determined to be uncollectible 
income tax expense benefit we did not record a tax provision in fiscal or fiscal since we have unutilized net operating loss carryforwards from prior years which will be utilized to offset taxes associated with our income in fiscal 
table of contents we have established a valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred tax assets because of uncertainties related to our ability to utilize certain federal and state loss carryforwards as measured by gaap 
the economic benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards to future years will continue until expired 
we recognized a tax benefit of during fiscal at the end of fiscal  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates ranging from through though valuation allowances have been established  we still retain all the economic benefits of the net operating loss in future years 
deemed dividend on preferred stock on may  we completed the sale of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock 
each share of the preferred stock is immediately convertible into ten shares of common stock 
because the preferred stock was issued at a discount to the market price on the date of issue and because it is immediately convertible into common stock  we were required to record a deemed dividend on preferred stock in our financial statements for the year ended august  this non cash dividend is to reflect the implied economic value to the preferred stockholders of being able to convert their shares into common stock at a discounted price 
in order to determine the dividend value  we allocated the proceeds of the offering between preferred stock and the common stock warrants that were issued as part of the offering based on their relative fair values 
the fair value allocated to the warrants of was recorded as equity 
the fair value allocated to the preferred stock of  together with the original conversion terms were used to calculate the value of the deemed dividend on the preferred stock of  at the date of issuance of the preferred stock 
this amount has been charged to accumulated deficit with the offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item on the statement of operations to adjust reported net income loss to net income loss available to common stockholders 
financial condition our net cash flow used in operating activities for fiscal was  compared to cash flow used in operating activities of  for fiscal the use of cash in operations in fiscal was driven by an increase of  of accounts receivable and an increase of  of inventory 
both of these increases are due to the growth in our revenues in fiscal over fiscal in addition  we paid down accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the year which required the use of cash and caused us to increase the use of our line of credit 
these uses of cash were offset by an improvement in our operating results 
in fiscal we generated net income of as compared with a net loss of  in fiscal our net cash flow used in operating activities for fiscal was  compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of for fiscal for fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was used as a result of increases of  in accounts payable and in accrued liabilities  more than offset by increases in accounts receivable of  restricted cash of  other assets of  and a  increase in the net loss from  in fiscal to  in fiscal non cash items for fiscal consist of depreciation and amortization expense of  and the gain on the prepayment of a promissory note of the decreases in non cash expenses were primarily the result of decreased depreciation from the fully depreciated fixed assets 
our net cash flow used in investing activities was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we spent  and on capital expenditures and patent costs in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we were able to increase our capital spending in fiscal because of our improved operating results 
the capital expenditures in all three years relate to facility improvements and purchases of manufacturing equipment to enhance our production capabilities  capacity and quality control systems 
we generated in fiscal from the sale of technology 
in fiscal the cash used for investing activities was primarily for the amo acquisition and capital expenditures 
our net cash flow from financing activities in fiscal was  and was primarily related to cash proceeds from the issuance of series a convertible preferred stock during the year 
this offering generated 
table of contents net proceeds of  for the company 
we also generated cash through additional borrowings on our line of credit of  and by the repayments on notes from officers and former directors of during fiscal we repaid on our long term debt 
in addition to these financing activities  we also utilized non cash capital lease financing to acquire of equipment 
our net cash flow generated from financing activities in fiscal was  as compared with net cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal of  cash generated from issuance of common stock was  and  respectively  for fiscal  and fiscal during fiscal  of cash was generated in connection through the collection of officer notes 
during fiscal  in connection with the purchase of our amo  we issued a subordinated promissory note to cmed in the principal amount of  the  decrease in restricted cash for fiscal was used to prepay long term debt 
the majority of other year to year changes relate to the borrowings and repayment under our accounts receivable and term loan agreements 
the result of these activities was an increase in cash of in fiscal as compared with decreases in cash of and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at the end of fiscal our cash balance was accounts receivable average days outstanding were days at august   compared to and days at august  and  respectively 
inventory turns were  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal were approximately the same as at the end of fiscal as our accounts receivable balances increased in connection with the growth in our sales 
the increased days outstanding in fiscal versus fiscal is mainly due to a large proportion of the revenues that were generated in the last month of the year and the continued diversification of the customer base 
the inventory turns for fiscal improved slightly as we work to improve our supply chain management 
the company s current ratio at the end of fiscal was as compared to and at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the improvement in fiscal is due to the growth of the business which required increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
this working capital growth was funded by the issuance of stock during the year 
as of august  we had long term debt of million and stockholders equity of  the decrease in the current ratio in fiscal from fiscal is due to the relative larger growth in accounts payable versus accounts receivable  increase in the line of credit and the growth in accrued liabilities and other current assets due to the deferral of revenue and the related cost of goods sold 
term debt long term debt during our fiscal years ended august  and  we have undertaken a number of activities to restructure our term debt 
the following is a summary of those transactions at the time of our amo acquisition in january cmed  the seller  funded a subordinated promissory note 
on may  the subordinated promissory note was sold by cmed to a third party for  the agreement continued with the same terms as the original agreement with cmed until august  to encourage early repayment  the terms of the subordinated promissory note were modified on may  and on september  on october   we prepaid the subordinated promissory note for a discount on the principal amount outstanding of  the payment of accrued interest totaling with  unregistered common shares of hei stock valued at per share and forgiveness of interest from september  through october  as a result of the prepayment of the subordinated promissory note  the company recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of the subordinated promissory note totaling during the first quarter of fiscal the funds to prepay the subordinated promissory note were obtained from two separate loans in the aggregate amount of  under new term loan agreements with commerce bank  a minnesota state 
table of contents banking association  and its affiliate  commerce financial group  inc  a minnesota corporation 
the first note  with commerce bank  in the amount of  was executed on october  this note is secured by our victoria  minnesota facility 
the term of the first note is six years 
the original interest rate on this note was a nominal rate of per annum for the first three years  and thereafter the interest rate will be adjusted on the first date of the fourth loan year to a nominal rate per annum equal to the then three year treasury base rate as defined plus  provided  however  that in no event will the interest rate be less than the prime rate plus per annum 
monthly payment of principal and interest will be based on a twenty year amortization with a final payment of approximately  due on november  the second note  with commerce financial group  inc  in the amount of  was executed on october  the second note is secured by our victoria facility and equipment located at our tempe facility 
the term of the second note is four years 
the original interest rate on this note was of per year through september  monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of are paid over a forty eight month period beginning on october  during the first quarter of fiscal  we violated two covenants of these term loan agreements 
as a result  on december   we entered into waiver and amendments with commerce bank and commerce financial group  inc  respectively  effective as of november  and december   to address actual and potential covenant violations 
the waiver and amendments on december  increased the interest rate to be paid under the commerce bank note beginning march   to and including october   from to  and increased the interest rate to be paid under the commerce financial group  inc note beginning march   to and including september   from to 
the company is in compliance with all covenants as of august  during fiscal  the company entered into several capital lease agreements to fund the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
the total principal amount of these leases is with an average effective interest rate of 
these agreements are for three years with reduced payment terms over the life of the lease 
at the end of the lease  we have the option to purchase the equipment at an agreed upon value which is generally approximately of the original equipment cost 
however  this amount may be reduced to if our equity increases by million within months of the date of these leases 
short term debt since early in fiscal  we have had an accounts receivable agreement the credit agreement with beacon bank of shorewood  minnesota 
the credit agreement was modified several times during fiscal and and now expires on september  the credit agreement provides for a maximum amount of credit  the credit agreement is an accounts receivable backed facility and is additionally secured by inventory  intellectual property and other general intangibles 
the credit agreement is not subject to any restrictive financial covenants 
at year end we had a maximum of approximately  available under the credit agreement  with the actual borrowings based on of eligible accounts receivable 
the balance on the line of credit was  and  as of august  and  respectively 
the credit agreement as amended on july  bears an interest rate of prime plus 
there is also an immediate discount of 
for processing 
prior to july   borrowings under the facility required an immediate processing fee of of each assigned amount  a daily per diem equal to on any uncollected accounts receivable 
borrowings are reduced as collections and payments are received into a lock box by the bank 
in fiscal  the effective interest rate based on our average dso of days would be annualized 
this rate was approximately the same in fiscal prior to the amendment in july 
the effective borrowing rate subsequent to that amendment was approximately 
as of the august   the company is in compliance with all covenants of the credit agreement 

table of contents fiscal liquidity we generated net income in fiscal of after incurring net losses of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the improvement in operating results was driven by numerous changes implemented over the past two years to correct operational problems 
these actions included improved sales and marketing activities  production improvement initiatives and expense reductions 
in fiscal  cash used in operations of  was due to the increases in sales which required a significant investment in working capital 
in prior years  cash used in operations was due to the company s significant operating losses which created a situation that severely strained our cash resources 
we have historically financed our operations through the public and private sale of debt and equity securities  bank borrowings under lines of credit  operating equipment leases and cash generated by operations 
in fiscal  we entered into two separate loans in the aggregate amount of  which enabled us to prepay a high cost subordinated promissory note assumed in the acquisition of our amo business and which provided cash for operations 
on february   we sold  shares of our common stock which generated net proceeds of million 
on may   we sold  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock which provided net proceeds of million to the company 
these actions  together with the improved operating results  enabled us to fund working capital requirements  acquire manufacturing equipment and expand our credit agreement 
the expansion included increasing the borrowing capacity to million while reducing the interest rate and improving other terms and conditions of the facility 
the credit agreement is due to expire in september  over the past two years we have taken other actions to provide cash to fund our operations 
these actions include the recovery of approximately  against judgments against our former chief executive officer  president and chairman  the settlement of an action related to our amo which provided cash of  the collection of previously written off promissory notes and the collection of notes receivable from officers and former directors 
in addition  we facilitated the sale of our boulder building which enabled us to enter into a modified lease on that facility which significantly reduced our lease payments 
we also entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of that facility which will reduce our cash needs related to this facility in fiscal through the end of the lease by approximately 
million per year 
as a result of these events  at august  our sources of liquidity consisted of of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of borrowing capacity under our credit agreement 
in addition  subsequent to year end  we received million from the landlord of our boulder facility which was the refund of a portion of our security deposit 
these funds were returned in accordance with the satisfaction of conditions in our lease agreement 
our liquidity  however  is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business  the most significant of which include the timing of the collection of receivables  the level of inventories and capital expenditures 
in the event cash flows are not sufficient to fund operations at the present level  measures can be taken to reduce the expenditure levels including but not limited to reduction of spending for research and development  engineering  elimination of budgeted raises  and reduction of non strategic employees and the deferral or elimination of capital expenditures 
in addition  we believe that other sources of liquidity are available including issuance of the company s stock  the expansion of our credit agreement and the issuance of long term debt 
during fiscal  we intend to spend approximately million for manufacturing equipment which we expect to expand our manufacturing capacity and our technological capabilities in order to meet the expanding needs of our customers
