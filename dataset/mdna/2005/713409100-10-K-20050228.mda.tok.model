in some of our territories  we also have the right to manufacture  sell and distribute soft drink products of companies other than pepsico  inc pepsico  including dr pepper and squirt and trademarks we own including electropura  epura and garci crespo 
our products are sold in either a cold drink or take home format 
our cold drink format consists of cold products sold in the retail and foodservice channels  which carry the highest profit margins on a per case basis 
our take home format consists of unchilled products that are sold for at home future consumption 
physical cases represent the number of units that are actually produced  distributed and sold 
each case of product as sold to our customers  regardless of package configuration  represents one physical case 
our net price and gross margin on a per case basis is impacted by how much we charge for the product  the mix of brands and packages we sell  and the channels in which the product is sold 
for example  we realize a higher net revenue and gross margin per case on a ounce chilled bottle sold in a convenience store than on a two liter unchilled bottle sold in a grocery store 
our financial success is dependent on a number of factors  including our strong partnership with pepsico  the customer relationships we cultivate  pricing we achieve in the marketplace  our market execution and the efficiency we achieve in manufacturing and distributing our products 
key indicators of our financial success are measured by the number of physical cases we sell  the net price and gross margin we achieve on a per case basis  and our overall cost productivity  reflecting how well we manage our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other overhead costs

financial performance summary weeks ended december december   change net revenues   gross profit   operating income income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income diluted earnings per share cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the fifty two weeks ended december   reflects the impact of adoption of eitf issue no 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
diluted earnings per share include the following items non cash charge related to the adoption of eitf 
non cash charge related to a canadian tax law change see results of operations total during  we delivered solid results  reflecting strong topline growth  which was partially offset by higher raw material costs and selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
overall  we grew our worldwide operating income by two percent  driven by a four percent increase in the us and double digit increases in canada and europe  partially offset by an operating income decline in mexico of 
these results include a million non cash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to our re evaluation of the fair value of our franchise licensing agreement with cadbury bebidas  sa de sa for the squirt trademark in mexico  as a result of a change in its estimated accounting life 
our strong topline growth was driven by innovation and solid execution in the marketplace 
this growth has been balanced  reflecting three percent growth in net revenue per case and two percent growth in volume  with the remaining percentage of growth coming from foreign currency translation 
in the us  we achieved a two percent volume increase due primarily to the successful introduction of tropicana juice drinks and growth in aquafina and our diet portfolio 
in europe  we delivered strong results  growing net revenues by percent versus the prior year  driven by double digit volume growth in russia and turkey 
in canada  tropicana twister was introduced in  and was a key player in the growth of non carbonated drinks in that geography 
our product portfolio and packaging has been well positioned to capture the opportunity presented by changing consumer preferences geared toward health and wellness  variety and convenience 
our strong topline growth was partially offset by increases in cost of sales  which has continued to pressure our bottom line results 
on a per case basis  cost of sales increased five percent  reflecting significant increases in raw material costs coupled with mix shifts into more expensive products and packages 
during  we have experienced increases in concentrate prices  coupled with growth in aluminum  sweeteners and resin prices  which added more than million of costs or one and a half percentage points of growth to our worldwide cost of sales per case 
additionally  the negative impact of foreign currency translation contributed one percentage point of growth to our cost of sales increase 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses increased four percent  which includes one percentage point of growth from foreign currency 
the remaining three percentage points of growth were due primarily to higher labor and benefit costs 
these increases were partially offset by cost savings driven from a number of worldwide productivity initiatives we put in place during and a reduction in our bad debt expense 
in mexico  we faced a number of challenges throughout the year including competitive pressures  increased commodity costs and the devaluation of the mexican peso 
low priced bargain brands continue to be an important factor in the marketplace  which has made it difficult for us and all soft drink suppliers to increase pricing 
cost of sales in mexico has also been impacted by rising sweetener costs throughout the year and a steep rise in resin costs in the fourth quarter 
we have made a number of investments in the marketplace and in our infrastructure in mexico  which should provide long term benefits  particularly in our water business and in our operating efficiency 
trends are improving in mexico  with volume increasing by four percent in the second half of the year  bringing our volume to flat for the full year 
innovation and execution in the marketplace played a key role in our volume improvement during the year 
during  we introduced a number of new products and packages  added  new accounts to our customer base and placed  net new coolers 
from a cash flow perspective  we continued our strong track record of growing our cash from operations 
we generated billion of cash from operations  after contributing million into our pension plans  which are solidly funded 
with our strong cash flows  we utilized million for capital investments to grow our business and returned million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the year 
during  we increased our annual dividend  raising it from to per share 
outlook in  our fiscal year will include a rd week  while fiscal year consisted of weeks 
our us and canadian operations report on a fiscal year that consists of weeks  ending on the last saturday in december 
every five or six years a rd week is added 
our other countries report on a calendar year basis 
in order to provide comparable guidance for  we have excluded the impact of the rd week from our outlook 
the table and the outlook discussion below provide pro forma disclosure by excluding the projected impact of the rd week in pro forma forecasted impact of rd forecasted versus versus growth week growth worldwide volume to to us and canada volume flat to to worldwide sd a in dollars to to worldwide operating profit in dollars flat to to pro forma full year impact of rd full year forecasted forecasted results week results interest expense  net to million million to million diluted earnings per share to to to in  we expect our pro forma worldwide volume to grow between two and three percent  with the us and canada each expected to be flat to up one percent  mexico up three to four percent and europe up mid to high single digits 
we will carefully balance our net revenue per case  using rate increases where marketplace conditions allow  while also managing the mix of products we plan to sell 
we expect to increase our worldwide net revenue per case one to two percent  which reflects a three percent increase in the us  partially offset by larger contributions from our international territories that typically have lower net revenue per case than the us  coupled with an expected mid single digit decline in the value of the mexican peso 
in  worldwide cost of sales per case is expected to increase by four to five percent 
we are expecting the prices of resin  sweetener and aluminum to continue to increase  driving higher costs in excess of million during versus the prior year 
as a result  we expect our gross margin per case growth to be flat 
our pro forma selling  delivery and administrative expenses are expected to rise two to three percent  reflecting increases in labor and benefits  partially offset by productivity initiatives in the us and mexico 
due to the increasing costs of our business  we expect pro forma operating income growth to be flat to up three percent 
in  we expect pro forma interest expense to increase to approximately million to million  reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on approximately of our debt that is variable 
we expect to deliver a pro forma diluted earnings per share of to  excluding the impact of the rd week 
we are considering reinvestment of the additional profit from the rd week in long term strategic initiatives 
our outlook does not reflect the effect of the implementation of the final accounting standard on the expensing of share based payments  which will have a material impact on our results 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
additionally  the american jobs creation act of was enacted allowing for special tax breaks for the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries 
we are evaluating whether to repatriate our undistributed foreign earnings in from a cash flow perspective  we expect to generate net cash provided by operations of about billion and we plan to spend between million and million in capital investments 
our cash flows from operations in are expected to decline versus due to the expiration of legislated tax incentives 
during  two us tax stimulus packages will expire  which allowed for accelerated tax deductions 
additionally  due to improved performance during  we will be paying out higher incentive compensation in  which will also drive some year over year unfavorability 
critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to customer disputes  bankruptcies and sales returns 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and is dependent upon the overall economic environment and our customers viability 
we provide reserves for these situations based on the evaluation of the aging of our trade receivable portfolio and an in depth analysis of our high risk customers 
our reserves contemplate our historical loss rate on receivables  specific customer situations and the economic environments in which we operate 
we have effective credit controls in place to manage these exposures and believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for these risks 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million as of december   december  and december   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in our portfolio 
the following is an analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  allowance for doubtful accounts beginning of the year bad debt expense additions from acquisitions accounts written off foreign currency translation 
end of the year recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our identified intangible assets principally arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired  and consist primarily of franchise rights  distribution rights and brands 
we assign amounts to such identified intangibles based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the expected life will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the identified intangible asset 
in determining whether our intangible assets have an indefinite useful life  we consider the following as applicable the nature and terms of underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset contained in an agreement  the age and market position of the products within the territories we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth of those products  and costs  if any  to renew the agreement 
we evaluate our identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually unless it is required more frequently because of a triggering event on an individual basis or by asset groups on a country by country basis  depending on the nature of the intangible asset 
we measure impairment as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights is measured using a multi period excess earnings method that is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the franchise rights and distribution rights will continue in perpetuity 
we deduct a contributory charge from our net after tax cash flows for the economic return attributable to our working capital  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  which represents the required cash flow to support these assets 
the net discounted cash flows in excess of the fair returns on these assets represent the estimated fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights 
the fair value of our brands is measured using a multi period royalty saving method  which reflects the savings realized by owning the brand and  therefore  not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party 
in valuing our brands  we have selected an estimated industry royalty rate relating to each brand and then applied it to the forecasted revenues associated with each brand 
the net discounted after tax cash flows from these royalty charges represent the fair value of our brands 
our discount rate utilized in each fair value calculation is based upon our weighted average cost of capital plus an additional risk premium to reflect the risk and uncertainty inherent in separately acquiring the identified intangible asset between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
the additional risk premium associated with our discount rate effectively eliminates the benefit that we believe results from synergies  scale and our assembled workforce  all of which are components of goodwill 
each year we re evaluate our assumptions in our discounted cash flow model to address changes in our business and marketplace conditions 
we evaluate goodwill on a country by country basis reporting unit for impairment 
we evaluate each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  we would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we measure the fair value of a reporting unit as the discounted estimated future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the business continues in perpetuity  less its respective minority interest and net debt net of cash and cash equivalents 
our long term terminal growth assumptions reflect our current long term view of the marketplace 
our discount rate is based upon our weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 
each year we re evaluate our assumptions in our discounted cash flow model to address changes in our business and marketplace conditions 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment test for goodwill and other identified intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the volatility in the markets in which we conduct business 
a change in assumptions in our cash flows could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and other identified intangible assets  which could then result in a material impairment charge to our results of operations 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables including anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  historical health care cost trends and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income 
the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement medical expense for any fiscal year are determined as of september of the preceding year measurement date 
the discount rate assumption used in our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans accounting is based on current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt as determined on each measurement date 
in evaluating our rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider the year historical return of our pension investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted return of our asset allocation 
over the past three fiscal years  the composition of our pension assets in the us was approximately equity investments and fixed income securities  which primarily consist of us government and corporate bonds 
differences between actual and expected returns are generally recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants 
the rate of future compensation increases is based upon our historical experience and management s best estimate regarding future expectations 
we amortize prior service costs on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits 
we used the following weighted average assumptions to compute our pension and postretirement medical expense in the united states pension discount rate expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses rate of compensation increase postretirement discount rate rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate during  our company sponsored defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expenses in the us totaled million 
in  these expenses will increase by million to million due primarily to the following factors a decrease in our weighted average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical expense from to  reflecting declines in the yields of long term corporate bonds 
this assumption change will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
changes in demographics assumptions  including mortality  and other plan changes will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
merging our long term disability medical plan with our postretirement medical plan 
in  we amended our long term disability medical plan to provide coverage for two years for participants becoming disabled after january  participants currently receiving benefits will be grandfathered under the existing benefits program 
the costs of million associated with these participants will be reclassified from our long term disability medical plan to our postretirement medical plan beginning in casualty insurance costs due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
in the united states we are self insured for workers compensation and automobile risks for occurrences up to million  and product and general liability risks for occurrences up to million 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability 
we evaluate these estimates with our actuarial advisors periodically during the year and we believe that they are appropriate  although an increase or decrease in the estimates or events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefit and costs we expect to realize 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
a significant portion of deferred tax assets consists of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have net operating loss carryforwards totaling  million at december   which are available to reduce future taxes in the us  spain  greece  russia  turkey and mexico 
the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards is generated overseas  the largest of which is coming from our mexican and spanish operations due to the financing put in place when we purchased the business of pepsi gemex  sa de sa of these carryforwards  million expire in and  million expire at various times between and significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe these positions may be challenged 
we adjust these reserves as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
under our tax separation agreement with pepsico  inc  pepsico maintains full control and absolute discretion for any combined or consolidated tax filings for tax periods ended on or before our initial public offering that occurred in march however  pepsico may not settle any issue without our written consent  which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld 
pepsico has contractually agreed to act in good faith with respect to all tax audit matters affecting us 
in accordance with the tax separation agreement  we will bear our allocable share of any risk or upside resulting from the settlement of tax matters affecting us for these periods 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years for which we have audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the us internal revenue service is currently examining our and pepsico s joint tax returns for through march and our tax returns for the balance of and while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction of our tax expense in the year of resolution 
unfavorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction to our reserves  a cash outlay for settlement and a possible increase to our annual tax provision 
related party transactions pepsico is considered a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and its ownership interest in our company 
over of our volume is derived from the sale of brands from pepsico 
at december   pepsico owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and of our outstanding class b common stock  together representing approximately of the voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
in addition  pepsico owns of the equity of bottling group  llc  our principal operating subsidiary 
we fully consolidate the results of bottling group  llc and present pepsico s share as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 
our business is conducted primarily under beverage agreements with pepsico  including a master bottling agreement  non cola bottling agreement and a master syrup agreement 
additionally  under a shared services agreement  we obtain various services from pepsico  which include services for information technology maintenance and the procurement of raw materials

because we depend on pepsico to provide us with concentrate  bottler incentives and various services  changes in our relationship with pepsico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
bottler incentives and other arrangements in order to promote pepsico beverages  pepsico  at its discretion  provides us with various forms of bottler incentives 
these incentives are mutually agreed upon between pepsico and us and cover a variety of initiatives  including direct marketplace support  capital equipment funding and advertising support

the goodwill and franchise rights are not subject to amortization 
the non compete agreements are being amortized over five to ten years 
the allocations of the purchase price for these acquisitions are still preliminary and will be determined based on the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the dates of acquisitions 
the operating results of each of our acquisitions are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from its respective date of purchase 
these acquisitions were made to enable us to provide better service to our large retail customers 
we expect these acquisitions to reduce costs through economies of scale

market risks and cautionary statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include the risk associated with the price of commodities purchased and used in our business  interest rates on outstanding debt and currency movements of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the business environment in which we operate  including the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess all of these risks and have policies and procedures in place to protect against the adverse effects of these exposures 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the applicable rates and prices 
to achieve this objective  we have derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our derivative instruments 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and other financial instruments 
to perform the sensitivity analysis  we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the hypothetical changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
information provided by this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor were held constant 
in addition  the results of the analysis are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically excluded from the analysis  while the financial instruments that relate to the financing or hedging of those items are included 
as a result  the reported changes in the values of some financial instruments that affect the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use futures contracts and options on futures in the normal course of business to hedge anticipated purchases of certain commodities used in our operations 
with respect to commodity price risk  we currently have various contracts outstanding for commodity purchases in  which establish our purchase prices within defined ranges 
we estimate that a decrease in commodity prices with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
interest rate risk the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the fair market value of our debt  representing differences between market interest rates and the fixed rate on the debt 
as a result of the market risk  we effectively converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
we estimate that a decrease in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a net increase in the fair value of our financial instruments which includes both our fixed rate debt and our interest rate swaps of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk in  approximately of our net revenues came from outside the united states 
social  economic and political conditions in these international markets may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the overall risks to our international businesses include changes in foreign governmental policies and other political or economic developments 
these developments may lead to new product pricing  tax or other policies and monetary fluctuations that may adversely impact our business 
in addition  our results of operations and the value of the foreign assets and liabilities are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our businesses outside the us into us dollars affects year over year comparability 
we generally have not hedged against these types of currency risks because cash flows from our international operations are usually reinvested locally 
we have foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
beginning in  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar cash flows in our canadian business 
at december   a weaker us dollar against the canadian dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of million 
conversely  a stronger us dollar against the canadian dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of million 
foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transaction gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translation gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
turkey and russia were considered highly inflationary economies for accounting purposes in beginning in  russia was no longer considered highly inflationary  and as a result  changed its functional currency from the us dollar to the russian ruble 
there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of russia s change in functional currency 
for and  turkey was still considered a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes 
unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price as well as price changes in certain other equity and fixed income investments 
employees participating in our deferred compensation program can elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to be paid out on a future date or dates 
as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increase or decrease the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
therefore  changes in compensation expense as a result of changes in our stock price are substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of these contracts 
we estimate that a unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have reduced the fair value from these commitments by million in and cautionary statements except for the historical information and discussions contained herein  statements contained in this annual report on form k and in the annual report to the shareholders may constitute forward looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different 
among the events and uncertainties that could adversely affect future periods are changes in our relationship with pepsico that could have a material adverse effect on our long term and short term business and financial results  restrictions imposed by pepsico on our raw material suppliers that could increase our costs  material changes from expectations in the cost of raw materials and ingredients  decreased demand for our product resulting from changes in consumers preferences  an inability to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives  impact of competitive activities on our business  impact of customer consolidations on our business  an inability to achieve cost savings  material changes in capital investment for infrastructure and an inability to achieve the expected timing for returns on cold drink equipment and related infrastructure expenditures  material changes in expected levels of bottler incentive payments from pepsico  changes in product category consumption  unfavorable weather conditions in our markets  unforeseen economic and political changes  possible recalls of our products  an inability to meet projections for performance in newly acquired territories  failure or inability to comply with laws and regulations  changes in laws and regulations governing the manufacture and sale of food and beverages  including restrictions on the sale of carbonated soft drinks in schools  changes in laws and regulations governing the environment  transportation  employee safety  labor and government contracts  changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements including unfavorable outcomes from audits performed by various tax authorities  changes in our debt ratings  material changes in expected interest and currency exchange rates and unfavorable market performance of our pension plan assets  interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements  loss of business from a significant customer  and limitations on the availability of water or obtaining water rights

we account for our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical benefit plans using actuarial models required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement medical expense for any fiscal year are determined as of september of the preceding year measurement date 
the discount rate assumption used in our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans accounting is based on current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt as determined on each measurement date 
in evaluating our rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider the year historical return of our pension investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted return of our pension plan asset allocation 
differences between actual and expected returns are generally recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants 
we amortize prior service costs on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefit and costs we expect to realize 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe these positions may be challenged 
we adjust these reserves as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock that would then participate in net income 
cash equivalents cash equivalents represent funds we have temporarily invested with original maturities not exceeding three months 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to customer disputes  bankruptcies and sales returns 
we provide reserves for these situations based on the evaluation of the aging of our trade receivable portfolio and an in depth analysis of our high risk customers 
our reserves contemplate our historical loss rate on receivables  specific customer situations and the economic environments in which we operate 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the cost of our inventory is generally computed on the first in  first out method 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment pp e at cost  except for pp e that has been impaired  for which we write down the carrying amount to estimated fair market value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
we evaluate our identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually unless it is required more frequently because of a triggering event on an individual basis or by asset groups on a country by country basis  depending on the nature of the intangible asset 
we measure impairment as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
based upon our annual impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair values of our identified intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeded their carrying amounts 
however  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter due to our re evaluation of the fair value of our franchise licensing agreement for squirt resulting from our negotiations with cadbury in december see note other intangible assets  net and goodwill for additional information 
we evaluate goodwill on a country by country basis reporting unit for impairment 
we evaluate each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  we would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based upon our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value  and as a result  we did not need to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
other identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which we expect to receive economic benefit and are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of the expected life will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset 
in our evaluation of the intangible assets  we consider the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  the customer s attrition rate  competitive environment and brand history  as applicable 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques 
casualty insurance costs in the united states we are self insured for workers compensation and automobile risks for occurrences up to million  and product and general liability risks for occurrences up to million 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs was million as of december  of which million was reported in accounts payable and other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
minority interest pbg and pepsico contributed bottling businesses and assets used in the bottling businesses to bottling group  llc  our principal operating subsidiary  in connection with the formation of bottling group  llc in february at december   pbg owns of bottling group  llc and pepsico owns the remaining 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements reflect pepsico s share of the consolidated net income of bottling group  llc as minority interest in our consolidated statements of operations  and pepsico s share of consolidated net assets of bottling group  llc as minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
treasury stock we record the repurchase of shares of our common stock at cost and classify these shares as treasury stock within shareholders equity 
repurchased shares are included in our authorized and issued shares but not included in our shares outstanding 
we record shares reissued using an average cost 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in october  we have repurchased approximately million shares and have reissued approximately million for stock option exercises 
financial instruments and risk management we use derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements associated with commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments are generally designated and accounted for as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge 
the derivative s gain or loss recognized in earnings is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 
if a fair value or cash flow hedge were to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or were terminated  it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled  but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively 
if a forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring  amounts previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be recognized immediately in earnings 
on occasion  we enter into derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these instruments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
we also may enter into a derivative instrument for which hedge accounting is not required because it is entered into to offset changes in the fair value of an underlying transaction recognized in earnings natural hedge 
these instruments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
stock based employee compensation we measure stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock option and restricted stock grants to our employees is measured as the excess of the quoted market price of common stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock 
our policy is to grant stock options based upon the fair value of the pbg stock on the date of grant

the franchise licensing agreements for the squirt trademark were considered to have an indefinite life and granted the pepsi bottling group mexico srl pbg mexico the exclusive right to produce  sell  and distribute beverages under the squirt trademark in certain territories of mexico 
in december  cadbury bebidas  sa de sa cadbury mexico  the owner of the squirt trademark  sent pbg mexico notices that purportedly terminated the squirt licenses for these territories effective january  pbg mexico believes that these licenses continue to be in effect and that cadbury mexico has no legally supportable basis to terminate the licenses 
however  as a result of these recent unanticipated actions  pbg mexico is no longer certain that it will have the right to distribute squirt in mexico after certain of its contractual rights expire in accordingly  we have concluded that the franchise rights relating to the squirt trademark should no longer be considered to have an indefinite life  but should be treated as having a year life for accounting purposes 
due to the reduction in the useful life of these franchise rights  we wrote the carrying value of the squirt franchise rights down to its current estimated fair value 
the remaining carrying value will be amortized over the estimated useful life of years  resulting in approximately million of expense each year  starting in we measured the fair value of squirt s franchise rights using a multi period excess earnings method  which was based upon estimated discounted future cash flows for years 
we deducted a contributory charge from our net after tax cash flows for the economic return attributable to the working capital and property  plant and equipment  for squirt s franchise rights 
the net discounted cash flows in excess of the fair returns on these assets represent the fair value of the squirt franchise rights

these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we are subject to foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
beginning in  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar purchases in our canadian business 
these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we have also entered into treasury rate future contracts to hedge against adverse interest rate changes on debt issued in and for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument  which is highly effective  is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a fair value change on a qualifying cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately and is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item

the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these contracts was not material to our results of operations in  or fair value hedges we finance a portion of our operations through fixed rate debt instruments 
we effectively converted million of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these interest rate swaps meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting and are effective in eliminating the market rate risk inherent in our long term debt 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a decrease of million and million in and  respectively

unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price as well as price changes in other equity and fixed income investments 
participating employees in our deferred compensation program can elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to be paid out on a future date or dates 
as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
at december   we had a prepaid forward contract for  shares at an exercise price of  which was accounted for as a natural hedge 
this contract requires cash settlement and has a fair value at december   of million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of this contract changes based on the change in our stock price compared with the contract exercise price 
we recognized million in income in and million in losses in  resulting from the change in fair value of these prepaid forward contracts 
the earnings impact from these instruments is classified as selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
other financial assets and liabilities financial assets with carrying values approximating fair value include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
financial liabilities with carrying values approximating fair value include accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and short term debt 
the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their short maturities and since interest rates approximate current market rates for short term debt 
long term debt at december   had a carrying value and fair value of billion and billion  respectively  and at december   had a carrying value and fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
the fair value is based on interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
note pension and postretirement medical benefit plans pension benefits our us employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all full time salaried employees  as well as most hourly employees

we currently provide postretirement medical benefits to a group of retirees employees who retired prior to the beginning of with little or no cost sharing 
additionally  we provide postretirement medical benefits to another group of retirees employees who retired between and that will have cost sharing once their annual costs are twice the costs 
for these retiree groups  the prescription drug benefit provided by us would be considered to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the act 
therefore  we retroactively applied the fsp to the date of enactment 
as a result the obligation accumulated projected benefit obligation decreased by million  and the net periodic postretirement medical benefits cost decreased by million for the year ended december  there were no changes in estimates of participation or per capita claims costs as a result of the act 
the specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the act is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require us to change previously reported information 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits to another group of retirees employees who retired after with cost sharing 
at present  due to the lack of clarifying regulations related to the act  we cannot determine if the benefit provided by us would be considered actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the act and therefore  we cannot determine its impact on our financial statements
