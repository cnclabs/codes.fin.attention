all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its network service access nsa product lines  particularly the sale of network interface unit niu products and related products 
niu products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
niu products and dsl products are the two major products within the company s telecom equipment business 
telecom equipment constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal  which constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company is comprised of two segments telecommunications equipment manufacturer and teleconference services bureau 
the equipment manufacturing segment consists of two product lines customer networking equipment cne products and network service access nsa products 
the cne product line includes broadband and digital subscriber line dsl technology products that allow the transport of high speed data over the local loop and enable telecommunications companies to provide broadband services over existing copper infrastructure 
the company s nsa product line consists of manageable and non manageable t transmission equipment  associated mountings and special service plugs for the legacy copper telephone network 
westell realizes the majority of its revenues from the north american market 
the company s teleconference service segment is comprised of a owned subsidiary  conference plus  inc conference plus provides audio  video  and web conferencing services 
businesses and individuals use these services to hold voice  video or web conferences with many people at the same time 
conference plus sells its services directly to large customers  including fortune companies  and serves other customers indirectly through its private label reseller program 
the equipment manufacturing segment of the company s business consists of two product lines  offering a broad range of products that facilitate the broadband transmission of high speed digital and analog data between a telephone company s central office and end user customers 
these two product lines are customer networking equipment cne westell s family of broadband products enable the transport of high speed data over existing local telephone lines and allow telecommunications companies to provide broadband services using their current copper infrastructure 
the company s broadband products also enable residential  small business and small office home office soho users to network multiple computers  telephones and other devices to access the internet 
digital subscriber lines dsl products make up the majority of the revenue in this product group 
network service access nsa westell s nsa product family consists of manageable and non manageable t transmission equipment for telephone services  and an array of mounting products used for connecting telephone wires and cables  and special service plugs 
the t transmission equipment termed network interface units niu and the associated niu mounting products make up the majority of revenue from this product group 
below is a table that compares annual revenue from the company s two reportable segments and the two main equipment product groups 
fiscal of revenue fiscal of revenue fiscal of revenue cne equipment nsa equipment total equipment segment services segment total revenue the prices for the products within each market group vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers 
increasing competition  in terms of the number of entrants and their size  and increasing size of the company s customers because of past mergers  continues to exert downward pressure on prices for the company s products 
on january   sbc and at t announced that they had entered into an agreement for sbc to acquire at t 
sbc and at t indicated that the acquisition is subject to approval by at t s shareholders and regulatory authorities  and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by the first half of in the twelve months ended march   sales to sbc generated approximately of the company s total revenues  for the equipment segment primarily nsa products and for the services segment 
sbc is the largest customer of conference plus 
at t offers services similar to conference plus 
the company is unable to predict how the merger will impact the company s results of operations in the future 
on april   conference plus  inc  the company s services segment  entered into an agreement with sbc services  inc pursuant to which conference plus  inc would continue to provide conferencing services to sbc 
the agreement has a term of months 
the agreement continues to permit sbc to use other service providers and continues to not obligate sbc to purchase any minimum quantity of services from the company 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the regional bell operating companies rbocs  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant upfront investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in addition  to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
the company is focusing on expanding its product offerings in the equipment segment from basic high speed broadband to more sophisticated applications such as networking  wireless and managed services 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
in view of the company s reliance on the dsl market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from nsa products such as nius have declined in recent years due primarily to reduced demand resulting from the migration by telephone companies to high speed digital transmission products and the sale of data station termination product lines that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal in the equipment manufacturing segment  the company is focusing on new product opportunities in the dsl wireless gateway  voice media over ip  and vertical applications 
the company has introduced new products including ultraline tm  proline tm  versalink tm  trilink tm and envoy tm which are targeted at the home networking  small office home office soho and small business markets 
in addition  the company announced a partnership with verizon to develop verizon one tm a multimedia access device using dsl broadband technology that the company expects verizon to introduce in fiscal the company is also focusing on expanding existing and new products into the international markets 
the company believes that its customers continue to expect growth in the broadband market that the company s cne products serve 
more users are subscribing to dsl services and some subscribers currently using dsl technology desire new dsl technology as the older modems cannot deliver newer applications that require higher broadband speed 
the nsa market continues to decline as the transition to high speed digital service continues 
the company expects nsa revenue to continue to decline to per year 
the company s goal is to increase market share in mountings and nius in the nsa market to offset in part reduced prices for nius and mountings 
the company is investing in new products in the nsa product line that complement the broadband market products such as powerspan that may support the deployment of voip in residential markets and partnership derived products such as virtualedge tm and iteleport tm 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgements in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company sells products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
inventory reserves the company reviews ending inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company also evaluates ending inventory for lower of cost or market 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are at market rates and normally do not extend beyond one year 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues  as there was in fiscal  the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for potential losses on such commitments 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company has significant deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from historically generated net operating losses 
a valuation allowance has been provided for a portion of these deferred tax assets that management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized 
the company accesses the realizability of deferred tax assets through an analysis of projected future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income is comprised of a tax planning strategy and a three year estimate of future income that will be generated by operations 
goodwill and intangibles accounting rules require that the company evaluate goodwill for impairment annually 
the company determined that it operated in two reporting units for the purpose of completing the impairment test of goodwill 
these reporting units are telecom equipment and telecom services 
the company utilizes the comparison of its market capitalization and third party appraisal of its telecom services reporting unit to book value as an indicator of potential impairment 
the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal these tests showed no impairment of goodwill 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
software development the company accounts for software development costs under fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company reviews software development to determine when technological feasibility is reached 
at such time  development costs will be capitalized as intangible assets 
these intangible assets will be amortized over the product life once the product is available for customer use 
at of march   the company had million in capitalized costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  equipment services total revenues cost of equipment cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative intangible amortization restructuring charge total operating expenses gain on sale of assets operating income other income  net interest expense income before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit minority interest net income fiscal years ended march   and revenues

quarterly cne revenues grew due to increased unit sales of dsl products offset in part by lower sales prices per unit 
the cne revenue increase in third and fourth quarters of fiscal year was also due to the sales of versalink tm product which has a higher average selling price per unit than traditional modems 
in addition  the company s customers had strong promotions that positively impacted the unit sales of the versalink tm product 
sales are expected to return to normalized levels 
nsa revenues decreased in fiscal and fiscal due primarily to reduced demand resulting from the migration by telephone companies to high speed digital transmission products and the sale of data station termination product lines that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal conference plus service revenues were relatively flat due to increased call minutes offset by less revenue per minute

the march and june equipment margin was also positively impacted by a  and  contract settlement that had no corresponding cost of sales 
the december  and march  equipment margin were negatively impacted by million and  of expediting charges relating to the versalink tm product 
the company believes continued pricing pressures affecting its equipment segment could adversely impact sales prices and margins in the future 
it is the company s strategy to offset the effects of these anticipated price reductions with continued cost reductions and efficiencies within manufacturing 
margins in the services segment of the business improved due to lower long distance costs 
operating expenses were impacted by increased spending in sales and marketing in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development declined due to software capitalization in the fiscal quarters 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat over the quarters 
overall operating expenses have decreased as a percentage of sales due to revenue increasing at a faster rate than expenses 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade corporate commercial paper 
at march   the company had no amounts outstanding and million available under its secured revolving credit facility

the term on the credit facility expires on june  this asset based revolving credit facility provides for total borrowings based upon of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory not to exceed million as of march  the million inventory limitation is reduced by million on the first day of each month 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility at march  was million 
borrowings under this facility provide for the interest to be paid by the company at the prime rate or libor rate plus 
this credit facility contains covenants regarding ebitda  tangible net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with these covenants on march  and expects to comply with these covenants for the term of the debt 
in connection with the company s management changes implemented at its subsidiary conference plus  inc  in fiscal year  the company purchased of the outstanding shares of common stock of conference plus  inc from former officers of conference plus  inc for approximately million payable in cash and promissory notes 
the purchase price was based upon the minority interest value set forth in the annual appraisal of conference plus  inc that was completed by an independent financial advisor 
as of march   there was  outstanding under these notes 
the company s operating activities generated cash of million  million and million in fiscal   and respectively 
cash generated by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net income  non cash depreciation and amortization in both segments and reductions in inventory offset in part by reductions in accounts payable in the equipment segment 
the inventory reductions were achieved by selling products throughout the year that were in inventory at march  cash generated by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net income  non cash depreciation and amortization and tax benefit received from the exercise of employee stock options in both segments and was offset in part by the increase in deferred tax assets and inventories

future obligations and commitments consisted of the following payments due by fiscal year in thousands thereafter total debt and capital leases purchase obligations future minimum lease payments for operating leases future obligations and commitments purchase obligations consist of raw materials in the equipment segment and local and long distance telephone service commitments in the service segment that arise in the normal course of business operations 
the company had deferred tax assets of approximately million at march  the company has recorded a valuation allowance reserve of million to reduce the recorded net deferred tax asset to million 
the net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
the company uses estimates of future taxable income and a tax planning strategy that involves the potential sale of the company s subsidiary conference plus  inc to access the valuation allowance required against deferred tax assets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets accordingly
