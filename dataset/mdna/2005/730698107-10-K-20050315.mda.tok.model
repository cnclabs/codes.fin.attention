item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  certain statements in this annual report are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  which involve certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein  including but not limited to competition  customer and industry concentration  depending on technological developments  risks related to expansion  dependence on key personnel  fluctuating results and seasonality and control by management 
see the relevant discussions in the company s documents filed with the securities and exchange commission and cautionary statements and risk factors in this item  for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the company s business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgements 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we have made critical estimates in the following areas revenues 
we perform a multitude of services for our clients  including film to tape transfer  video and audio editing  standards conversions  adding effects  duplication  distribution  etc 
a customer orders one or more of these services with respect to an element commercial spot  movie  trailer  electronic press kit  etc the sum total of services performed on a particular element a package becomes the deliverable ie  the customer will pay for the services ordered in total when the entire job is completed 
occasionally  a major studio will request that package services be performed on multiple elements 
each element creates a separate revenue stream which is recognized only when all requested services have been performed on that element 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make judgments  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances as a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangibles  comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
long lived assets  including goodwill and intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset 
the cash flow projections are based on historical experience  management s view of growth rates within the industry and the anticipated future economic environment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following l significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  l significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  l significant negative industry or economic trends  l significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and l our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
any amount of impairment so determined would be written off as a charge to the income statement  together with an equal reduction of the related asset 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to approximately million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill beginning in we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during the year ended december  in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the initial test on january   and the fiscal  and tests performed as of september   and  respectively  required no goodwill impairment 
the discounted cash flow method used to evaluate goodwill impairment included cash flow estimates for and subsequent years 
if actual cash flow performance does not meet these expectations due to factors cited above  any resulting potential impairment could adversely affect reported goodwill asset values and earnings 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
the company did not record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of december results of operations we are one of the largest providers of video and film asset management services to owners  producers and distributors of entertainment and advertising content 
we provide the services necessary to edit  master  reformat  archive and ultimately distribute our clients film and video content  including television programming  spot advertising  feature films and movie trailers using electronic and physical means 
we deliver commercials  movie trailers  electronic press kits  infomercials and syndicated programming to hundreds of broadcast outlets worldwide 
our interconnected facilities in los angeles  new york  chicago  dallas and san francisco provide service coverage in each of the major us media centers 
clients include major motion picture studios  advertising agencies and corporations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment in which customers desire a broad range of service at a reasonable price 
there are many competitors offering some or all of the services provided by the company 
additionally  some of our customers are large studios  which also have in house capabilities that may influence the amount of work outsourced to companies like point 
we attract and retain customers by maintaining a high service level at reasonable prices 
in recent years  electronic delivery services have grown while physical duplication and delivery have been declining 
we expect this trend to continue over a long term ie the next years 
all of our electronic  fiber optics  satellite and internet deliveries are made using third party vendors  which eliminates our need to invest in such capability 
however  the use of others to deliver our services poses the risk that costs may rise in certain situations that cannot be passed on to customers  thereby lowering gross margins 
there is also the risk that third party vendors who directly compete with us will succeed in taking away business or will restrict our access to their distribution capabilities 
the company has an opportunity to expand its business by establishing closer relationships with our customers through excellent service at a competitive price 
our success is also dependent on attracting and maintaining employees capable of maintaining such relationships 
also  growth can be achieved by acquiring similar businesses for example  the acquisition of international video conversions  inc ivc in july which can increase revenues by adding new customers  or expanding services provided to existing customers 
our business generally involves the immediate servicing needs of our customers 
most orders are fulfilled within several days  with occasional larger orders spanning weeks or months 
at any particular time  we have little firm backlog 
we believe that our nationwide interconnected facilities provide the ability to better service national customers than single location competitors 
we will look to expand both our service offering and geographical presence through acquisition of other businesses or opening additional facilities 
during  we completed the acquisition of international video conversions  inc ivc and settled all disputes related to a proposed acquisition of three subsidiaries of alliance atlantis communications  inc alliance 
the financial statement comparisons below highlight the effects of these transactions

previously reported amounts have been adjusted to segregate alliance related expenses from selling  general and administrative expense for consistency of presentation among periods 
while the above presentation of pro forma income statements and adjustments do not represent the results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we believe that this disclosure provides useful information for readers of the financial statements in analyzing the causes of operating differences from period to period 
additional comparative data is set forth below 
in total  revenues in were below levels 
without the inclusion of ivc  a company purchased on july   revenues in would have been million  a decrease of from pro forma revenues if ivc had been purchased at the beginning of the year would have been million 
the addition of ivc will not only increase revenues in twelve months of operations compared to six months in  but will add to the cost infracture of the company in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative s  g a areas 
with the inclusion of ivc and the elimination of the duplicated rent and move costs associated with the consolidation of four media asset storage facilities  we expect gross margins as a percentage of sales to be slightly higher than experienced in we expect s  g a in to be higher as a percentage of sales than in excluding the special charge due to the addition of management and sales personnel and costs associated to sarbanes oxley process documentation and assessment and the addition of stock option compensation expense due to the required july  implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no

a portion of the vault expenditures were covered by cash previously advanced by the building landlord and reflected as accrued expenses on the december  balance sheet about million 
all advanced amounts have been either paid out or reclassified as accounts payable as of september  other principal changes in cash flows related to financing activities and are described below

in march  the company paid off the remaining million prior term loan principal balance with of cash and proceeds from the new million term loan pursuant to a new credit agreement 
the new agreement provided up to million of revolving credit availability for two years and a five year million five year term loan 
the agreement was subsequently amended to increase the revolving credit and term loan availability by million and million  respectively 
for the first two years of the term loan  the company can re borrow all principal payments on million of the term loan to finance up to of capital equipment purchases 
the agreement provides for interest at the banks prime rate or libor plus for the revolver  prime rate plus or libor plus for the term loan  and requires the company to maintain certain financial covenant ratios

after the initial build out of the new facility and termination of the existing leases during  the resulting annual lease and operating expense levels are expected to be favorable to the company 
a provision of the lease provided that in may  the company had an option to purchase the building for approximately  we purchased the building in august by paying  in cash and borrowing the  million balance under a mortgage term loan payable over years

when preparing estimates of future cash flows  we consider historical performance  technological changes  market factors  industry trends and other criteria 
in our opinion  the company will continue to be able to fund its needs for the foreseeable future 
the company  from time to time  considers the acquisition of businesses complementary to its current operations 
consummation of any such acquisition or other expansion of the business conducted by the company may be subject to the company securing additional financing  perhaps at a cost higher than our existing term loan 
future earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted to the extent that any acquired entities do not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to offset the increased financing costs

cautionary statements and risk factors in our capacity as company management  we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to our long term objectives or expectations which may be included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec  reports to stockholders and information provided in our web site 
the words or phrases will likely  are expected to  is anticipated  is predicted  forecast  estimate  project  plans to continue  believes  or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected 
we wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are calling to your attention important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the following list of important factors may not be all inclusive  and we specifically decline to undertake an obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve expected operating results and growth plan goals and or affect the market price of our stock are l recent history of losses l prior breach and changes in credit agreements 
l our highly competitive marketplace 
l the risks associated with dependence upon significant customers 
l our ability to execute our expansion strategy 
l the uncertain ability to manage growth 
l our dependence upon and our ability to adapt to technological developments 
l dependence on key personnel 
l our ability to maintain and improve service quality 
l fluctuation in quarterly operating results and seasonality in certain of our markets 
l possible significant influence over corporate affairs by significant shareholders 
these risk factors are discussed further below 
recent history of losses 
the company reported losses for each of the five fiscal quarters ended december  due  in part  to lower gross margins and lower sales levels and a number of unusual charges 
although we achieved profitability in fiscal and prior years  as well as in the three fiscal years ended december   there can be no assurance as to future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
prior breach and changes in credit agreements 
due to lower operating cash amounts resulting from reduced sales levels in and the consequential net losses  the company breached certain covenants of its credit facility 
the breaches were temporarily cured based on amendments and forbearance agreements among the company and the banks which called for  among other provisions  scheduled payments to reduce amounts owed to the banks to the permitted borrowing base 
in august  the company failed to meet the principal repayment schedule and was once again in breach of the credit facility 
the banks ended their formal commitment to the company in december in may  we entered into an agreement with the banks to restructure the credit facility to a term loan maturing on december  as part of this restructuring  the banks waived all existing defaults and the company was required to make principal payments of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in march  we entered into a revised agreement with the banks providing revolving and term loan facilities 
annual principal payments for the term loan are million each for five years 
any principal outstanding under the revolver will be due in march in july and august  the credit agreement was amended in connection with the acquisition of another company see note to increase the amounts that can be borrowed under the revolving and term loan portions of the arrangement 
approximately million was borrowed to consummate the transaction 
also in august  we borrowed  to purchase land and a building to house our los angeles area vault storage facilities 
while we believe operating cash flows are sufficient to service increased total debt levels  reduced future sales levels  if they occur  could possibly result in a breach of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreements 
in november  we began discussion with the banks to amend certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreement to more closely track our changing business environment which has contributed to lower sales and profits in recent quarters 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in achieving such changes and  if we are not successful  there is a risk that we will be in default of certain financial covenants in future quarters 
if a default condition exists in the future  all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement will be due and payable which could materially and adversely affect our business 
competition 
our post production  duplication and distribution industry is a highly competitive  service oriented business 
in general  we do not have long term or exclusive service agreements with our customers 
business is acquired on a purchase order basis and is based primarily on customer satisfaction with reliability  timeliness  quality and price 
we compete with a variety of post production  duplication and distribution firms  some of which have a national presence  and to a lesser extent  the in house post production and distribution operations of our major motion picture studio and advertising agency customers 
some of these firms  and all of the studios  have greater financial  distribution and marketing resources and have achieved a higher level of brand recognition than the company 
in the future  we may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors merely on the basis of reliability  timeliness  quality and price or otherwise 
we may also face competition from companies in related markets which could offer similar or superior services to those offered by the company 
we believe that an increasingly competitive environment as evidenced by recent price pressure and some related loss of work and the possibility that customers may utilize in house capabilities to a greater extent could lead to a loss of market share or additional price reductions  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
customer and industry concentration 
although we have an active client list of over  customers  ten motion picture studios and advertising agencies accounted for approximately of the company s revenues during the year ended december  if one or more of these companies were to stop using our services  our business could be adversely affected 
because we derive substantially all of our revenue from clients in the entertainment and advertising industries  the financial condition  results of operations and prospects of the company could also be adversely affected by an adverse change in conditions which impact those industries 
expansion strategy 
our growth strategy involves both internal development and expansion through acquisitions 
we currently have no agreements or commitments to acquire any company or business 
even though we have completed nine acquisitions in the last seven fiscal years  the most recent of which was in july  we cannot be sure additional acceptable acquisitions will be available or that we will be able to reach mutually agreeable terms to purchase acquisition targets  or that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
certain of the businesses previously acquired by the company reported net losses for their most recent fiscal years prior to being acquired  and our future financial performance will be in part dependent on our ability to implement operational improvements in  or exploit potential synergies with  these acquired businesses 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including adverse effects on our reported operating results including the amortization of acquired intangible assets  diversion of management s attention and unanticipated problems or legal liabilities 
in addition  we may require additional funding to finance future acquisitions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure acquisition financing on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also use working capital or equity  or raise financing through equity offerings or the incurrence of debt  in connection with the funding of any acquisition 
some or all of these risks could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and prospects or could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
in addition  to the extent that consolidation becomes more prevalent in the industry  the prices for attractive acquisition candidates could increase substantially 
we may not be able to effect any such transactions 
additionally  if we are able to complete such transactions they may prove to be unprofitable 
the geographic expansion of the company s customers may result in increased demand for services in certain regions where it currently does not have post production  duplication and distribution facilities 
to meet this demand  we may subcontract 
however  we have not entered into any formal negotiations or definitive agreements for this purpose 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect such transactions or that any such transactions will prove to be profitable 
in july  the company issued a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock to alliance atlantis communications  inc alliance in consideration of an option to purchase three post production facilities the subsidiaries owned by alliance 
in connection therewith  the company capitalized the fair value of the warrant  determined by using the black scholes valuation model 
in december  the option was extended by mutual agreement and we deposited  toward the ultimate purchase price  which was negotiated downward 
additionally  the company capitalized approximately  of due diligence costs associated with the proposed acquisition and approximately  of costs associated with a related new financing arrangement 
in june  discussions with alliance and the new lenders were terminated 
as a result  the company wrote off the above mentioned deposit  due diligence costs and costs associated with the proposed new financing 
the  value of the warrant was charged to additional paid in capital because  in management s opinion  alliance had breached certain provisions of the option agreement resulting in a termination event according to the provisions of the warrant 
in july  alliance filed a complaint seeking a judicial determination that alliance has full right of legal ownership to the warrant as well as the  deposit 
on july   alliance filed a complaint against the company in the superior court of justice  ontario  canada 
the complaint alleged that the company breached a non disclosure agreement between alliance and the company by issuing a press release with respect to termination of negotiations to purchase the subsidiaries without obtaining the required prior written consent of alliance 
alliance maintained that the press release impaired its ability to extract value from the subsidiaries and negatively affected its ability to sell the subsidiaries to a third party 
the complaint sought breach of contract and punitive damages of approximately million  expenses and a permanent order enjoining further such statements by the company 
on august   the company filed a counterclaim in the united states district court  central district of california against alliance for  among other things  misrepresentation and breach of contract seeking cancellation of the warrant and general damages of at least million 
in november  the company and alliance signed a settlement and mutual release agreement  and the company paid alliance  to settle all matters between the parties 
if we acquire any entities  we may have to finance a large portion of the anticipated purchase price and or refinance our existing credit agreement 
the cost of any new financing may be higher than our existing credit facility 
future earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted if any acquired entity does not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to offset the increased costs 
management of growth 
in prior years  we experienced rapid growth that resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and placed  and continues to place  increased demands on our management  operational and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate this growth  compete effectively and manage future growth  we will be required to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
we cannot be sure that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
dependence on technological developments 
although we intend to utilize the most efficient and cost effective technologies available for telecine  high definition formatting  editing  coloration and delivery of video content  including digital satellite transmission  as they develop  we cannot be sure that we will be able to adapt to such standards in a timely fashion or at all 
we believe our future growth will depend in part  on our ability to add to these services and to add customers in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot be sure we will be successful in offering such services to existing customers or in obtaining new customers for these services  including the company s significant investment in high definition technology in and we intend to rely on third party vendors for the development of these technologies and there is no assurance that such vendors will be able to develop such technologies in a manner that meets the needs of the company and its customers 
any material interruption in the supply of such services could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent on the efforts and abilities of certain of its senior management  particularly those of haig s 
bagerdjian  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss or interruption of the services of key members of management could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects if a suitable replacement is not promptly obtained 
mr 
bagerdjian beneficially owns approximately of the company s outstanding stock 
although we have severance agreements with mr 
bagerdjian and certain key executives  we cannot be sure that either mr 
bagerdjian or other executives will remain with the company 
in addition  our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  sales  operations  marketing and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the loss of any such persons  as well as the failure to recruit additional key personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel for the development of our business 
ability to maintain and improve service quality 
our business is dependent on our ability to meet the current and future demands of our customers  which demands include reliability  timeliness  quality and price 
any failure to do so  whether or not caused by factors within our control could result in losses to such clients 
although we disclaim any liability for such losses  there is no assurance that claims would not be asserted or that dissatisfied customers would refuse to make further deliveries through the company in the event of a significant occurrence of lost deliveries  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
although we maintain insurance against business interruption  such insurance may not be adequate to protect the company from significant loss in these circumstances and there is no assurance that a major catastrophe such as an earthquake or other natural disaster would not result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
in addition  our ability to make deliveries within the time periods requested by customers depends on a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including equipment failure  work stoppages by package delivery vendors or interruption in services by telephone or satellite service providers 
fluctuating results  seasonality 
our operating results have varied in the past  and may vary in the future  depending on factors such as the volume of advertising in response to seasonal buying patterns  the timing of new product and service introductions  the timing of revenue recognition upon the completion of longer term projects  increased competition  timing of acquisitions  general economic factors and other factors 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for example  our operating results have historically been significantly influenced by the volume of business from the motion picture industry  which is an industry that is subject to seasonal and cyclical downturns  and  occasionally  work stoppages by actors  writers and others 
in addition  as our business from advertising agencies tends to be seasonal  our operating results may be subject to increased seasonality as the percentage of business from advertising agencies increases 
in any period our revenues are subject to variation based on changes in the volume and mix of services performed during the period 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in sales due to seasonality may become more pronounced if the growth rate of the company s sales slows

issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of the company 
furthermore  certain provisions of the company s restated articles of incorporation and by laws and of california law also could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company
