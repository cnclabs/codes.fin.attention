item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of park ohio holdings corp 
and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the historical financial information is not directly comparable on a year to year basis  primarily due to debt extinguishment costs and writeoff of deferred financing costs associated with the tender and early redemption during of our senior subordinated notes due  restructuring and unusual charges in and  a goodwill impairment charge in to reflect the cumulative effect of an accounting change  and acquisitions and divestitures during the three years ended december  
table of contents executive overview we are an industrial supply chain logistics and diversified manufacturing business  operating in three segments ils  aluminum products and manufactured products 
ils provides customers with integrated supply chain management services for a broad range of high volume  specialty production components 
ils customers receive various value added services  such as engineering and design services  part usage and cost analysis  supplier selection  quality assurance  bar coding  product packaging and tracking  just in time and point of use delivery  electronic billing and ongoing technical support 
the principal customers of ils are in the heavy duty truck  electrical controls  automotive and other vehicle  industrial equipment  power sports equipment  lawn and garden equipment  and semiconductor equipment industries 
aluminum products casts and machines aluminum engine  transmission  brake  suspension and other components for automotive  agricultural equipment  construction equipment and heavy duty truck oems  primarily on a sole source basis 
aluminum products also provides value added services such as design and engineering and assembly 
manufactured products operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly engineered products including induction heating and melting systems  pipe threading systems  industrial oven systems  rubber products  and forged and machined products 
manufactured products also produces and provides services and spare parts for the equipment it manufactures 
the principal customers of manufactured products are oems and end users in the steel  automotive  oil and gas  rail  and aerospace and defense industries 
sales  earnings and other relevant financial data for these three segments are provided in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we experienced the increased sales and profitability previously forecast  as the manufacturing economy returned to growth  particularly in three of our customer industries heavy duty truck  semiconductor equipment  and equipment for steel manufacturing 
net sales increased compared to profitability increased more than proportionally to sales  based on cost reductions from our restructuring during the downturn in  and during those years  we consolidated supply chain logistics facilities  and closed or sold manufacturing plants 
during  we reinforced our long term availability and attractive pricing of funds by refinancing both of our major sources of borrowed funds senior subordinated notes and our revolving credit agreement 
in november  we sold million of senior subordinated notes due we used the net proceeds to fund the tender and early redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes due we incurred debt extinguishment costs primarily related to premiums and other transaction costs associated with the tender and early redemption and wrote off deferred financing costs totaling million associated with the repurchased senior subordinated notes 
in december  we amended our revolving credit agreement  extending its maturity to six years so that it now expires in december  increasing the credit limit so that we may borrow up to million subject to an asset based formula  and providing lower interest rate levels 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all our assets 
we had approximately million of unused borrowing availability at december  funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are expected to be adequate to meet our cash requirements 
we acquired substantially all of the assets of the amcast components group on august  for million cash and the assumption of approximately million of operating liabilities 
we sold substantially all the assets of st 
louis screw and green bearing in first quarter  for cash totaling approximately million  and castle rubber company in second quarter  for cash of approximately million 
we purchased substantially all the assets of ajax magnethermic corp 
in third quarter  for cash of approximately million 
accounting changes and goodwill on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under fas  we reviewed goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents assets and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  which was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle effective january  circumstances which led to this goodwill impairment included reduced sales  profitability and growth rates of the units with goodwill see note c to the consolidated financial statements  and reduced transaction prices for comparable businesses  which were themselves results of the downturn in the economy 
the effects of these circumstances on our operations  financial condition and liquidity are reflected in and results 
the goodwill impairment itself did not have any effect on operations 
under fas  goodwill was not amortized  starting in in accordance with fas  goodwill is now reviewed annually for potential impairment 
this review was performed as of october   and  using forecasted discounted cash flows  and it was determined that no further impairment is required 
at december   the balance sheet reflected million of goodwill in the ils and aluminum products segments 
in  discount rates used ranged from to  and long term revenue growth rates used ranged from to 
in  we changed our method of accounting for the of inventories utilizing the lifo method to the fifo method 
as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company restated its balance sheet as of december  and increased inventories by the recorded lifo reserve million  increased deferred tax liabilities million  and increased shareholders equity million 
previously reported results of operations were not restated because the impact of utilizing the lifo method had an insignificant impact on the company s reported amounts for consolidated net income loss

ils growth was partially offset by a million sales decrease related to the sale of green bearing 
aluminum products sales increased million due to the amcast components group acquisition in august  with additional growth from new contracts and increased volumes in the existing business 
manufactured products sales increased primarily in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses 
of this increase  million was due to the second quarter acquisition of the remaining of the common stock of jamco  partially offset by the divestiture of st

the million of sales from the acquired amcast business generated significantly lower margins than the existing aluminum products business 
we expect margins at the acquired plants to increase over time  as a result of post acquisition cost reductions  price increases and new business 
gross margin in the manufactured products segment increased  primarily as a result of increased sales and overhead efficiencies achieved in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses 
gross margins in both the aluminum products and manufactured products segments were negatively impacted by rising natural gas costs

despite this increase  sg a expenses as a percent of sales decreased by basis points due both to cost reductions from restructuring and to the absorption of these expenses over increased sales

excluding these costs  interest decreased due to lower average interest rates in  partially offset by higher average outstanding borrowings 
the lower average

we have not recognized any tax benefit for these loss carryforwards 
in accordance with the provision of statement of financial accounting standards no

the lower average borrowing rate in was due primarily to decreased rates on the company s new revolving credit agreement  beginning in august income tax in accordance with the provision of fas  the company recorded no tax benefit for the or net losses  because in both years it had incurred three years of cumulative losses 
income taxes of 
million were provided in and  primarily for state and foreign taxes on profitable operations 
at december   subsidiaries of the company had million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes 
the company has not recognized any tax benefit for these loss carryforwards 
liquidity and sources of capital our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our senior subordinated notes 
on july   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
on november   this credit agreement was amended to provide a facility for our subsidiaries in canada and the united kingdom 
on december   we amended this credit agreement to extend the maturity to six years  increase the credit line  provide lower interest rate brackets and modify certain covenants to provide greater flexibility 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  as amended  we may borrow up to million subject to an asset based formula 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are secured by substantially all our assets 
borrowings from the revolving credit agreement will be used for general corporate purposes 
the revolving credit agreement expires on december  
table of contents amounts borrowed under the revolving credit agreement may be borrowed at the company s election at either i libor plus basis points or ii the bank s prime lending rate 
the libor based interest rate is dependent on the company s debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
under the revolving credit agreement  a detailed borrowing base formula provides borrowing availability to the company based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  and approximately million of unused borrowing availability 
current financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet cash requirements for the next twelve months and through  when the revolving credit agreement matures 
the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is based on the company s ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant  which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends 
failure to meet the financial covenant could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings 
a significant component of the debt service ratio coverage calculation is ebitda  as defined 
ebitda  as defined  reflects earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change  interest and income taxes  and excludes depreciation  amortization  certain non cash charges and corporate level expenses as defined in the company s revolving credit agreement 
ebitda  as defined  is not a measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities and other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
the company presents ebitda  as defined  because management believes that this measure could be useful to investors as an indication of the company s satisfaction of its debt service coverage ratio covenant in its revolving credit agreement and because ebitda  as defined  is a measure used under the company s revolving credit agreement to determine whether the company may incur additional debt under such facility 
ebitda as defined herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table reconciles net income loss to ebitda  as defined net income loss add back cumulative effect of accounting change income taxes benefit interest expense depreciation and amortization restructuring and impairment charges non operating items miscellaneous ebitda  as defined at december   the company was in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant and the other covenants in the revolving credit agreement 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  working capital increased by million to million at december  from million at december  major components of working capital  including accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets  trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  increased 
table of contents substantially during due primarily to significant revenue growth and the acquisition of amcast components group and jamco 
during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the decrease of million was primarily the result of the increase in working capital  net of the impact of acquisitions  of million and the absence of non cash restructuring charges million in offset by the increase in net income of million 
during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures and million in an acquisition  generated million from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes and million from its bank credit agreements and used million to redeem the senior subordinated notes 
these activities resulted in an increase in cash of million for the year 
during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the decrease of million was primarily the result of a reduction in the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items equaling million in as compared to million of similar non cash items in the non cash items include cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  depreciation and amortization expense  restructuring and impairment charges and deferred income taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by the reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures  used million to pay down debt  and generated million from the divestiture of two manufacturing units 
these activities resulted in a decrease in cash of million for the year 
during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the increase of million was primarily the result of an increase in the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million in as compared to million in  which was the result of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of in net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by the reduction in the increase in accounts receivable and inventory in compared to during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures  used million to pay down debt  and consumed million from the net of an acquisition and a divestiture 
these activities resulted in an increase in cash of million for the year 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at december   
million of such hedge contracts were outstanding 
we currently use no other derivative instruments

table of contents critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize more than of our revenue when title is transferred to unaffiliated customers  typically upon shipment 
our remaining revenue  from long term contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
our policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectibility concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
writeoffs of accounts receivable have historically been low 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though we consider these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during  and  the company decided to exit certain under performing product lines and to close or consolidate certain operating facilities and  accordingly  recorded restructuring and impairment charges as discussed above and in note p to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
restructuring we recognize costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf  and sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges for charges prior to detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in the estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the changes 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which nullified eitf and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at the fair value only when the liability is incurred 
fas has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to goodwill we adopted fas as of january  under fas  we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 

table of contents we completed the transitional impairment review of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the charge has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have also completed the annual impairment test as of october   and and have determined that no additional goodwill impairment existed as of those dates 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
in determining these amounts  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income and the extended period of time over which the postretirement benefits will be paid 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire between and in accordance with the provisions of fas  the tax benefits related to these carryforwards have been fully reserved as of december  because the company is in a three year cumulative loss position 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we and our subsidiaries have pension plans  principally noncontributory defined benefit or noncontributory defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trends 
pension plan asset performance in the future will directly impact our net income 
we have evaluated our pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions  considering current trends in interest rates and market conditions and believe our assumptions are appropriate 
stock based compensation we have elected to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
compensation expense resulting from fixed awards of restricted shares is measured at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period 
an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation would be the fair value method defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
fas permits use of the intrinsic value method and does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
had compensation cost for stock options granted been determined based on the fair value method of fas  our net income loss and diluted income loss per share would have been decreased increased by 
million 
per share in  
million 
per share in  and 
million 
per share in in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes a fair value measurement objective in determining the value of such a cost 
fas r will be effective as of july  fas r is a revision of fas and supersedes apb the company is currently evaluating the impact of fas r on its consolidated financial statements 
environmental we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third party sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state laws that provide for strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability 
we are participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  our share of such costs 
table of contents has not been material and based on available information  our management does not expect our exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we have been named as one of many defendants in a number of asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
our cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and  based upon available information  our management does not expect our future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we caution  however  that inherent in management s estimates of our exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors that may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results our results of operations are typically stronger in the first six months than the last six months of each calendar year due to scheduled plant maintenance in the third quarter to coincide with customer plant shutdowns and due to holidays in the fourth quarter 
the timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our business units 
such variability is particularly evident at the capital equipment businesses  included in the manufactured products segment  which typically ship a few large systems per year

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our floating rate revolving credit facility  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  our foreign subsidiaries generally conduct business in local currencies 
during  we recorded a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment of million related to net assets located outside the united states 
this foreign currency translation adjustment resulted primarily from the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the canadian dollar  british pound and euro 
our foreign operations are also subject to other customary risks of operating in a global environment  such as unstable political situations  the effect of local laws and taxes  tariff increases and regulations and requirements for export licenses  the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions and transportation delays 
our largest exposures to commodity prices relate to steel and natural gas price increases  which have increased significantly in we do not have any commodity swap agreements or hedge contracts for future increases in steel or natural gas prices
