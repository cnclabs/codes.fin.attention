overview we are one of the largest distributors of residential and non residential roofing materials in the united states and canada 
we are also a distributor of other building materials  including siding  windows  specialty lumber products and waterproofing systems for residential and nonresidential building exteriors 
we purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors and  to a lesser extent  general contractors  retailers and building material suppliers 
we carry up to  skus through branches branches were added as a result of our acquisition of shelter in the united states and canada 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were in the united states 
we stock one of the most extensive assortments of high quality branded products in the industry  enabling us to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
execution of the operating plan at each of our branches drives our financial results 
revenues are impacted by the relative strength of the residential and non residential roofing markets we serve 
we allow each of our branches to develop its own marketing plan and mix of our products based upon its local market 
we differentiate ourselves from the competition by providing customer services  including job site delivery  tapered insulation layouts and design and metal fabrication  and by providing credit 
we consider customer relations and our employees knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials to be important to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer satisfaction 
we invest significant resources in training our employees in sales techniques  management skills and product knowledge 
while we consider these attributes important drivers of our business  we continually pay close attention to controlling operating costs 
our growth strategy includes both internal growth opening branches  growing sales with existing customers and introducing new products and acquisition growth 
our main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we presently do not serve 
our october acquisition of shelter and december acquisition of jga reflect this approach 
shelter is a leading distributor of roofing and other building materials with branches in the midwest  central plains and southwest  with minimal branch overlap with our existing operations 
jga is a leading southeast distributor of roofing and other building materials with nine branches in georgia  florida and alabama 
we also have acquired smaller companies to supplement branch openings within an existing region 
our april acquisition of insulation systems  inc of virginia isi  which we integrated into our region in the carolinas  is an example of such an acquisition 
general we sell all materials necessary to install  replace and repair residential and non residential roofs  including shingles  single ply roofing  metal roofing and accessories  modified bitumen  built up roofing  insulation  slate and tile  fasteners  coatings and cements  and other roofing accessories 
we also sell complementary building products such as vinyl siding  doors  windows and millwork  wood and fiber cement siding  residential insulation  and waterproofing systems 
the following is a summary of our net sales by product group for the last three full fiscal years year ended september  september  september  net sales mix net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products total note certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to confirm to the current year presentation 
shelter s net product group sales as a percentage of net sales for its fiscal year ended december  was residential roofing products  non residential roofing products and complementary building products 
we have over  customers  no one of which represents more than of our net sales 
many of our customers are small to mid size contractors with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain strict credit approval and review policies  which in the past has helped to keep losses from customer receivables within our expectations 
for the past five years  write offs for doubtful accounts have averaged less than of net sales 
our expenses consist primarily of the cost of products purchased for resale  labor  fleet  occupancy  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete for business and may respond to competitive pressures by lowering prices in order to maintain our market share 
since  we have made nine strategic and complementary acquisitions 
over the same time period  we opened new branches 
we opened two branches in and  three branches in  and six branches in when we open a new branch  we transfer a certain level of existing business from an existing branch to the new branch 
this allows the new branch to commence with a base business and also allows the existing branch to target other growth opportunities 
in managing our business  we consider all growth  including the opening of new branches  to be internal growth unless it results from an acquisition 
in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  when we refer to growth in existing markets  we include growth from existing and newly opened branches but exclude growth from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership for at least one full fiscal year 
during   and  our internal sales growth was  and  respectively 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the last saturday of september 
our fiscal years ended september   september   and september  all contained weeks 
results of operations the following discussion compares our results of operations for  and the following table shows  for the periods indicated  information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the period presented 
year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses stock based compensation income from operations interest expense change in value of warrant derivatives loss on early retirement of debt income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss compared to the following table shows a summary of our results of operations for and  broken down by existing markets and acquired markets 
for the fiscal years ended existing markets acquired markets consolidated in thousands net sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating expenses as a of net sales operating income operating margin net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in existing markets saw internal growth of million  or  while jga corp jga  insulation systems  inc of virginia isi and commercial supply  inc csi contributed the remaining increase 
during  we acquired branches from jga  isi and csi and opened six new branches 
jga  isi and csi had combined product group sales of  and million in residential roofing products  non residential roofing products  and complementary building products  respectively  while the product group sales for our existing markets were as follows net sales mix net sales mix growth dollars in millions residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products note certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to confirm to the current year presentation 
our existing market growth increased due primarily to the following factors strong residential roofing demand  continued penetration into complementary building products markets  a robust non residential market  including the impact from large price increases  continued home re modeling demand  opening of greenfield branches  and overall estimated price increases of approximately to 
gross profit change dollars in millions gross profit gross margin our overall gross profit increased million while our overall gross margin declined from to 
our existing markets gross profit growth of contributed million to the total gross profit increase while jga  isi and csi accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
existing markets gross margin was in compared to in  due mainly to the large increase in non residential roofing sales  which in general have lower gross margins than our other product groups  partly offset by an increase in the gross margin rate realized on those non residential sales 
due to their product mix  jga and isi have lower gross margins than our existing markets  which have further lowered our overall gross margin 
operating expenses change dollars in millions operating expenses operating expenses as a of sales operating expenses increased million or to million in from million in jga  isi and csi contributed million of this increase while existing markets operating expenses increased million or 
excluding the net change of million in stock based compensation  the existing markets operating expense increase was million  which was due primarily to increased payroll and related costs of million  or 
much of the increase in payroll costs was driven by our increased sales volume  but an increase in the cost of health insurance benefits also contributed to the increase 
we have also hired additional personnel for public company reporting and trainees for future expansion 
we also experienced an increase of million in professional fees in  as we incurred additional public company costs and continued with our sarbanes oxley section compliance project 
existing markets warehouse expenses  excluding depreciation  increased by million or  which reflects the addition of six new branches 
depreciation expense increased by million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in  primarily due to leveraging our fixed costs over our increased net sales and jga s and isi s lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
we expect to continue to incur additional administrative costs as a public company in the future  including additional costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
we incurred million in stock based compensation related to the remaining vesting of options in as compared to million in the prior year charge related to the termination of our rights to repurchase certain securities from our employees at the lower of cost or fair value and  to a lesser extent  the vesting of options and stock issued to certain employees below fair market value prior to the ipo 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in from million in although interest rates increased and we acquired jga  isi and csi through borrowings under our line of credit  our debt level remains substantially below levels due primarily to the ipo  resulting in a significant reduction in interest expense change in value of warrant derivatives the prior year charge of million for the change in the value of warrant derivatives was associated with warrant derivatives settled in connection with our ipo and was due to the effect of the increase in the fair market value of our common stock during loss on early retirement of debt on september   we used a portion of the proceeds from our ipo to pay off the remaining junior subordinated notes 
in connection with the associated early retirement of debt  we recorded a million loss in the first quarter of in march  we refinanced our credit facilities and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off a portion of our junior subordinated notes 
in connection with the associated early retirement of that debt  we recorded a million loss in the second quarter of income taxes income tax expense increased to million in from million in our effective income tax rate was  compared to our effective income tax rate of prior to the impact of the non deductible warrant derivatives charge 
the decrease is due to the strong earnings from our canadian subsidiary  which will enable us to use a more favorable tax credit for foreign taxes as compared to using a deduction for such foreign taxes in in addition  due to the strong earnings throughout our domestic regions and having no unusable losses in any state  we experienced a drop in our overall effective state income tax rate in we expect our future effective income tax rate to fluctuate between and  depending primarily upon the results of our operations in canada and in the various states in which we operate 
compared to net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the comparable period 
specifically  product group sales increased as follows net sales mix net sales mix growth dollars in millions residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products note certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to confirm to the presentation 
our residential roofing product growth was driven by the continued strength of the new housing market  especially in our mid atlantic region  and a strong remodeling market in all regions 
our continued introduction of complementary building products  such as fiber siding  vinyl siding and windows  also drove revenue growth by increasing market share primarily in the growing residential market 
our non residential roofing products growth came primarily from gains in the northeast from both new construction and re roofing markets 
since we did not acquire any branches in or  all of our sales growth of was from internal growth  including the addition of over  new customers during which contributed million in sales 
we opened three new branches in cost of products sold increased million  or  to million in from million for the increase reflects increases in volume from all of our product groups 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales  commonly referred to as gross margin  increased to in compared to in this increase was due to reduced pricing pressures from our customers in our non residential markets and gains in vendor rebates as a percentage of sales as we continued to have a gradual product mix change to residential products  which generally have higher rebates 
we were also able to pass through most of the price increases by our vendors to our customers 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the sg a expense increase was due primarily to increased transportation costs of million  including higher fuel costs  and increased payroll of million primarily related to the sales volume increase 
we expect high fuel costs to continue for the foreseeable future 
this increase may adversely affect our future results of operations  although historically we have passed most of these increases on to our customers 
we also experienced an increase of million in professional fees as we increased our recruiting efforts for corporate  sales and branch personnel  bad debts increased million due to the increased sales volume  and depreciation increased million due to increased capital expenditures 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in  primarily due to leveraging our fixed costs over our increased net sales 
we recorded million in stock based compensation in this compensation related to stock issued to certain employees below fair market value prior to our ipo 
interest expense decreased million to million in from million in although interest rates increased slightly  our lower debt levels and the refinancing of our higher interest rate debt  as described below  reduced our interest expense 
in march  we refinanced certain components of our indebtedness  paying off a portion of our junior subordinated notes payable  reducing our effective interest rate by basis points 
with this refinancing and the required repayment of a portion of our junior subordinated notes payable  we recognized a million loss on early retirement of debt 
on september   we used the proceeds of our ipo to pay off the remaining junior subordinated notes 
upon the use of the ipo proceeds to repay debt  our effective overall annual interest rate became approximately based upon september  base rates 
the change in value of our warrant derivatives was million in compared to million for this increase was due to the effect of the increase in the fair market value of our common stock 
as of september   we valued the warrant derivatives at million  which we redeemed on september  income taxes increased to million for from million in our effective income tax rate increased significantly due to the impact on our pre tax loss of the nondeductible warrant derivatives charge along with the non deductible portion of the stock based compensation charge 
our effective tax rate  exclusive of the impact of these charges  was approximately and for and  respectively 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in general  sales and net income are highest during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters  which represent the peak months of construction  especially in our branches in the northeastern us and in canada 
our sales are substantially lower during the second quarter  when we usually incur net losses 
these quarterly fluctuations have diminished as we have diversified into the southern regions of the united states 
we generally experience an increase of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable during the first  third and fourth quarters of the year as a result of seasonality 
our borrowings generally peak during the third quarter  primarily because dated accounts payable offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur from june through november 
we also usually experience a slowing of collections of our accounts receivable during our second quarter  mainly due to the inability of our customers to conduct their businesses effectively in inclement weather 
we continue to attempt to collect those receivables which require payment under our standard terms 
we do not provide any concessions to our customers during this period of the year to incentivize sales 
also  during the second quarter  we generally experience our lowest availability under our senior secured credit facilities  which are asset based lending facilities 
certain quarterly financial data the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the fiscal years and which  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends

inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations in   and we have experienced some recent price increases in our purchasing costs but we generally have been able to pass on such price increases to our customers 
liquidity and capital resources we had a cash overdraft of million at september  compared to a cash overdraft of million at september  our net working capital was million at september  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at september  the increase in working capital was due  in part  to the classification of the borrowings under our revolving lines of credit as long term debt at september  compared to the classification as current debt at september   as described further under indebtedness senior secured credit facilities below 
compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for our sales growth drove our income from operations to million in from million in accounts receivable  exclusive of the effect of businesses acquired  increased by million in compared to an increase of million in due to the strong increase in sales 
the number of days outstanding based upon our sales remained constant at approximately days for and accounts payable and accrued expenses  exclusive of the effects of businesses acquired  decreased by million in due primarily to a slowdown in fourth quarter purchases in we had increased inventory in prior to the fourth quarter to counteract some price increases and temporary shortages and to position us for a continued strong sales growth rate 
as we saw prices and demand moderate during the fourth quarter  we lowered our inventory levels to more normal levels 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in due to the acquisition of jga  isi  and csi for an aggregate net purchase price of million 
net capital expenditures increased to million from million as we opened six new branches in and continued to purchase transportation and warehouse equipment to service our growth and to upgrade and maintain our fleet of trucks 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in the net cash provided by financing activities in reflects borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  primarily for the acquisitions  and the proceeds from our ipo less the associated warrant redemption and debt payments 
the net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflected the refinancing of our credit facilities and the repayments of debt 
compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for the revenue growth generated from the mid atlantic regions and a strong remodeling market  along with a favorable product mix  drove our income from operations from in to million in inventory levels increased as we anticipated price increases and temporary shortages by increasing our purchases 
this growth in inventory was offset by an increase in accounts payable 
earned but not yet collected vendor rebates also increased as a result of the increased purchases 
accounts receivable collections remained strong during both years  evidenced by their relatively consistent levels  despite our increase in sales volume 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in we increased our purchases of transportation and material handling equipment to support our sales growth and to replace existing equipment 
we also entered into leases totaling approximately million for certain equipment in compared to in under our master lease line  which we recorded as capital lease obligations 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the cash used in financing activities in reflected the proceeds of our refinancing of our senior secured borrowings  related repayment of a portion of our junior subordinated notes payable and net repayments of our borrowings under revolving credit agreements 
the net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflected the repayment of amounts due under the senior notes payable and net repayments of our borrowings under revolving credit agreements 
capital resources our principal source of liquidity at september  was our available and unused borrowings of million under revolving lines of credit 
our borrowing base availability is determined primarily by trade accounts receivable and product inventory levels 
borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit at september  were classified as current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with eitf issue  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit arrangements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
due to recent changes in our lock box arrangements  revolver borrowings outstanding as of september  were classified as long term liabilities for amounts expected to be outstanding for greater than one year 
liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current need for cash 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
significant factors which could affect liquidity include the following the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms  cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings 
in the past  we have financed acquisitions initially through increased bank borrowings  the issuance of common stock and other borrowings  then repaying any such borrowings with cash flows from operations 
we have funded our capital expenditures through increased bank borrowings or through capital leases and then have reduced these obligations with cash flows from operations 
we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund our present operations  meet our commitments on our existing debt  and fund anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually seek potential acquisitions and from time to time hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a strong base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally  we may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock to raise funds and we are currently seeking to issue and sell  shares  excluding the proposed sales of shares by the selling stockholders 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay debt following the acquisition of sdi 
there is no certainty that this offering will be successful 
indebtedness we currently have the following credit facilities a senior secured credit facility in the us  a canadian senior secured credit facility  and a capital lease facility 
senior secured credit facilities our us revolving line of credit agreement  prior to the amendment discussed below  allowed for borrowings up to million subject to a limitation based on a percentage of eligible inventories and accounts receivable and any borrowings outstanding under our canadian revolving line of credit 
interest was payable monthly at the bank prime rate at september  plus or libor at september  plus 
this credit facility was to expire on september  we also had a revolving line of credit agreement that allowed for borrowings up to c million canadian  subject to a limitation based on a percentage of eligible inventories and accounts receivable 
as of september   interest was payable monthly at the canadian bank prime rate plus 
this credit facility was also to expire on september  the borrowings under the senior notes payable and revolving lines of credit were collateralized by substantially all of our assets and were subject to certain operating and financial covenants  which  among other things  restrict the payment of dividends

the facilities provide for a cash receipts lock box arrangement that gives us sole control over the funds in our lock box accounts  unless excess availability is less than million or an event of default occurs  in which case the senior secured lenders have the right to take control over such funds and to apply such funds to repayment of the senior debt 
the lock box arrangement is now operational 
interest on borrowings under the us facilities is payable at our election at either of the following rates an index rate that is the higher of a the base rate for corporate loans quoted in the wall street journal or b the federal reserve overnight rate plus of plus a margin of to  or the current libor rate plus a margin ranging from to

capital expenditures excluding acquisitions  we made capital expenditures of  and million in  and  respectively 
we also acquired million  million and million of equipment under capital leases in   and  respectively 
over of our capital expenditures have been generally made for transportation and material handling equipment 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as us gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation arrangements with employees under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have granted options to our employees to purchase our common stock at exercise prices determined by our board of directors on the date of the option grant 
the exercise price is generally based on the closing price of our stock on the grant date 
prior to the ipo  we estimated the fair value of the stock using an enterprise valuation method  based upon a multiple of our earnings  which we then discounted for liquidity 
we record deferred stock based compensation as necessary to the extent that the deemed value of the stock at the date of grant exceeds the exercise price of the option 
these valuations depend upon our determination of the fair market value of our stock and can vary based upon the value of our company and liquidity assumptions over time 
in the event we issue options at below fair market value  we would be required to record an additional charge 
however  we do not expect to grant options below fair market value in the future 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
requires the measurement of the fair value of the employee stock based awards to be included in the consolidated statements of operations or disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that we will account for stock based compensation granted to employees under apb no 
 and will elect the disclosure only alternative under sfas no 
in determining the pro forma compensation expense  we are following sfas no 
 which allows us to determine our best estimate of how many options are expected to vest 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the pro forma compensation 
it requires the use of judgment in the selection of the inputs to the model 
for a discussion of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  see recent accounting pronouncements below 
prior to the ipo  we had the right to repurchase certain shares of common stock issued to employees and shares issuable upon exercise of certain stock options at the lower of cost or fair value upon termination of employment for cause or upon resignation 
however  this repurchase right terminated upon our ipo 
we determined that these awards were performance based and  therefore  recognized a charge for the intrinsic value of the award in because the contingency was resolved 
based on our initial public offering price of  we recorded a charge of million for the stock awards in interest rate collars we enter into interest rate collars from time to time to manage our interest rate exposure 
these derivatives  which are not formal hedges  are adjusted to fair value through income 
we make estimates of the derivatives that are based upon estimates of future interest rates 
estimates are inherently uncertain and subjective 
these estimates may change over time and in the event actual results differ from the estimates upon settlement of the derivatives  we will adjust our results of operations in the period the estimates change 
historically  the estimate of the values of our interest rate collar derivatives have not differed significantly from the actual amount 
warrant derivative liabilities prior to september   we had warrants outstanding that included a put feature  which allowed the holder to require a cash settlement equivalent to the difference between fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price of the warrant 
the put feature was available at any time from five years after the date of issuance of the warrant or upon the occurrence of certain events  including a change in control  a qualified initial public offering or repayment of over of the related debt outstanding 
we accounted for these warrant derivatives in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
we valued the warrant derivatives using the fair market value of our common stock adjusted for lack of marketability prior to the ipo 
the aggregate liability for the derivatives amounted to million at september  and million at september  the relevant assumptions included in the calculations were discounts ranging from to at september  and at september  on july   holders of all warrants agreed to a cash settlement upon the effectiveness of the ipo at the ipo price  which was paid in full on september  the holders also agreed to reimburse us for certain costs incurred in connection with the ipo 
at september   we valued the warrants at the ipo price of  less the reimbursement of related offering costs 
there are no warrants currently outstanding 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from most customers within days  except for sales to our commercial roofing contractors  which we typically require to pay in days 
as our business is seasonal in certain regions  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
throughout the year  we record estimated reserves based upon our historical write offs of uncollectible accounts 
periodically  we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote based upon the following factors aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
we charge these write offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the past five years  write offs have averaged less than of net sales 
inventory valuation product inventories represent one of our largest assets and are recorded at net realizable value 
our goal is to manage our inventory so that we minimize out of stock positions 
to do this  we maintain an adequate inventory of skus at each branch based on sales history 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory 
during the year  we monitor our inventory levels by branch and record provisions for excess inventories based on slower moving inventory 
we define potential excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage  excluding items purchased in the last three months 
we then apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors  including liquidation value  to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value 
in addition  at the end of each year  we evaluate our inventory at each branch and write off and dispose of obsolete products 
our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence 
during the year  we perform periodic cycle counts and write off excess or damaged inventory as needed 
at year end we take a physical inventory and record any necessary additional write offs 
vendor rebates we account for vendor rebates in accordance with eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount  payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of purchases from our vendors 
we account for these rebates as a reduction of the prices of the related vendors products  which reduces the inventory cost until the period in which we sell the product  at which time these rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of rebates receivable based upon the expected level of purchases 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
historically  our actual rebates have been within our expectations used for our estimates 
if we fail to achieve a measure which is required to obtain a vendor rebate  we will have to record a charge in the period that we determine the criteria or measure for the vendor rebate will not be met to the extent the vendor rebate was estimated and included as a reduction to cost of sales 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to products already purchased  it may impact our gross margin on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin the securities and exchange commission requires that the following four basic criteria must be met before we recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue at the point of sale or upon delivery to the customer s site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  we recognize revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
approximately of our revenues are for products delivered by us  or picked up by our customers at our facilities  which provides for timely and accurate revenue recognition 
we also ship certain products directly from the manufacturer to the customer 
we recognize the gross revenue for these sales upon notification of delivery from the vendor in accordance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
delays in receiving delivery notifications could impact our financial results  although it has not been material to our consolidated results of operations in the past 
we also provide certain job site delivery services  which include crane rentals and rooftop deliveries of certain products  for which the associated revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
these revenues represent less than of our net sales 
all revenues recognized are net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns  which are provided for at the time of pick up or delivery 
in the past  customer returns have not been material to our consolidated results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires us to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
we have operations in us states and three provinces in canada and we are subject to potential tax audits in each of these jurisdictions and federally in both the united states and canada 
these audits may involve complex issues  that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of potential tax audits 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized and represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at september   our net goodwill balance was approximately million  representing approximately of our total assets 
pro forma for the acquisition of shelter  the net goodwill balance as of the same date was approximately million  representing of our total pro forma assets 
under sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
examples of such indicators that would cause us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include a significant change in the business climate  unexpected competition  significant deterioration in market share or a loss of key personnel 
we determine fair value using a market approach to value our business  which consists of one reporting unit  iedistribution of building materials 
prior to our ipo  our market approach involved applying an appropriate market multiple to operating performance for the trailing twelve month period 
as our common stock is now publicly traded  we believe our stock price is the best indicator of our market value 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value has fallen below book value  we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  companies will be required to recognize as expense the estimated fair value of all share based payments to employees  including the fair value of employee stock options 
pro forma disclosure of the estimated expense impact of such awards is no longer an alternative to expense recognition within the financial statements 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies in the first annual reporting period beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
there are two transition alternatives for public companies adopting the statement the modified prospective method and the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to recognize compensation expense for share based payments to employees  based on the grant date estimate of fair value  from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions of sfas no 
r are first applied 
prior period financial information would not be restated under this method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies would restate prior periods to include the recognition of compensation expense based on amounts previously reported in the pro forma disclosures relating to stock based compensation under the existing requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  such as is presented in note to our audited financial statements 
we have elected the modified prospective method upon adoption 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on our financial statements  in the form of additional compensation expense  on a quarterly and annual basis 
we are still in the process of evaluating the final impact of sfas no 
r 
however  our historic financial statements are relevant for evaluating the potential level of expense that might be recorded in future periods 
based on these results and fiscal year grants  which were issued in november  we estimate that quarterly and annual pre tax compensation expense after the adoption of sfas no 
r will increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the actual expense recognition upon adoption of sfas no 
r will not exceed these estimates based on actual grants during the year and our final evaluation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our on going business operations 
our primary exposure includes changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk our variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
at september   the weighted average interest rate on our million of variable interest debt was approximately 
while our variable rate debt obligations expose us to the risk of rising interest rates  management does not believe that the potential exposure is material to our overall financial performance or results of operations 
based on september  borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing a million additional pre tax change to our statements of operations 
financial derivatives we enter into interest rate derivative agreements  commonly referred to as swaps or collars  from time to time with the objective of reducing volatility in our borrowing costs 
at september   we had one interest rate collar effectively converting the variable libor component on a portion of our senior credit facility term debt to a fixed rate 
the collar had a notional amount of million  expired in september  and had a floor rate of and a cap rate of 
the fair market value of the agreement resulted in an asset of less than million at september   which was determined based on current interest rates and expected trends 
since these instruments do not qualify as a hedge  changes in the unrealized gain or loss are recorded in interest expense 
the differentials to be paid or received under the terms of the agreements are accrued as interest rates change and are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense related to the debt 
in november  we entered into an interest rate collar with a notional amount of million that expires in november and has a floor rate of and cap rate of 
we had warrants outstanding at september  that included a put feature  which allowed the holder to require a fair market value cash settlement at a fixed date 
we accounted for this warrant derivative in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the warrants were included as a liability and valued at fair value 
we paid the warrant derivative liability  which we valued at million at september   upon the closing of our ipo on september  foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from sales to customers in canada 
this business is primarily conducted in the local currency 
this exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can adversely affect revenues  net income and cash flows 
we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk
