item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  manufacture  sell and support integrated automation systems  primarily for the worldwide semiconductor and the flat panel display  or fpd  manufacturing industries 

table of contents we principally sell directly to the semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries 
we also sell to other original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that make production equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
our strategy is to offer integrated automation systems that enable semiconductor and fpd manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and yield and to protect their investment in fragile materials during the manufacturing process 
our functional currency is the us dollar  except for our japanese operations and their subsidiaries where our functional currency is the japanese yen 
the assets and liabilities of these japanese operations and their subsidiaries are generally translated using period end exchange rates 
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
on october   we established a joint venture with shinko electric  co  ltd  or shinko  called asyst shinko  inc  or asi 
the joint venture develops  manufactures  sells and supports automated material handling systems  or amhs  with principal operations in tokyo and ise  japan 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  we acquired percent of the joint venture for approximately million of cash and transaction costs 
shinko contributed its entire amhs business  including intellectual property and other assets  installed customer base and approximately employees  and retained the remaining percent interest 
we acquired asi to enhance our presence in the mm amhs and flat panel display markets 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction in accordance with sfas no 
and  accordingly  the results of asi are included in the consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to its acquisition 
we have two reportable segments the amhs segment  which consists principally of the entire asi operations  includes automated transport and loading systems  semiconductor and flat panel display products 
the fab automation product segment  which consists principally of the entire asyst technologies  inc  or ati  operations  includes interface products  auto id systems  substrate handling robotics  sorters  connectivity software  and continuous flow technology  or cft 
we believe critical success factors include manufacturing cost reduction  product quality  customer relationships  and continued demand for our products 
demand for our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global economic conditions  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  changes in customer buying patterns due to technological advancement and or capacity requirements  the relative competitiveness of our products  and our ability to manage successfully the outsourcing of our manufacturing activities to meet our customers demands for our products and services 
for this and other reasons  our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march   may not be indicative of future operating results 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follow to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements  the primary factors that resulted in those changes  and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
fiscal and year end dates effective as of february   we changed our fiscal year end date from the last saturday in march to march accordingly  the current fiscal year ended on march  fiscal year ended on march  and fiscal year ended on march  for convenience of presentation and comparison to current and prior fiscal years ended march  we refer throughout this report to the fiscal year ended march  however  all references to our fiscal year ended march  mean our actual fiscal year ended march  
table of contents internal control matters we conclude in item a of this form k that our disclosure controls and procedures  and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of march  the end of our fiscal year covered by this annual report 
item a provides a summary of material weaknesses outstanding as of that date that we identified in management s assessment of internal control and other related information 
the following is an overview of the circumstances leading to these conclusions 
see also risk factors below in this item if we continue to fail to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis  our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected and we experienced additional risks and costs as a result of the delayed filing of the form q for our fiscal second quarter and delayed filing of this form k 
delay in filing form q due november  in a form b filed on november   we stated that we did not timely file the form q for our fiscal second quarter ended september   due to a new erp information system within asi that was unable to provide timely reconciliation and reporting of inventory and cost information  and a subsequently resolved contract dispute with a customer stemming from an alleged agreement for a future payment of money by asi to a customer employee 
the fiscal second quarter form q was filed on december  the audit committee of our board of directors conducted an investigation of the customer dispute matter with independent legal and forensic advisors 
the audit committee concluded that our management had prevented the payment to the customer employee  no evidence of other improper payments was discovered  and our management was not involved in the improper conduct 
restatement of first quarter results in the process of closing asi s books during december  we also identified material accounting errors in asi s fiscal first quarter results  which led to our determination at that time to restate those results in the form q a filed on december  additionally  we made adjustments to fiscal first quarter results reported for ati  our base business 
the restatement corrected accounting errors that understated asi s costs of goods sold with corresponding corrections that increased its operating loss  and that overstated ati s net sales and operating income to reflect deferral of certain new product related revenue and to reduce amortization of stock based compensation 
the principal effects of the restatement adjustments on the consolidated fiscal first quarter results were to reduce consolidated net sales by million  increase consolidated cost of sales by million  reduce gross margin at asi from to  reduce consolidated gross margin from to  increase consolidated net loss from million to million and increase consolidated net loss per share from to nasdaq hearing in december  we appeared before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel to discuss our filing delay relating to the form q for the second fiscal quarter 
on january   the panel approved our request to continue the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
while the panel determined that the company then appeared to satisfy nasdaq s filing requirement  the panel stated it would continue to monitor us to ensure our compliance with the filing requirements over the long term 
the panel also determined to condition asyst s continued listing upon our timely filing all periodic reports with the sec and nasdaq for all reporting periods ending on or before january  if we fail to make any periodic report filing in accordance with this condition  the panel decision stated that a nasdaq panel will promptly conduct a hearing with respect to such failure  and our securities may be immediately delisted from the nasdaq stock market 

table of contents prior reports summarizing these matters other details relating to the above matters are set forth in part i  item and elsewhere in our forms q and q a filed on december   form q filed on february   form b filed on november   and forms k filed or furnished on november   and   december   and january  the matters described above constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  and we were not able to remediate all of these matters as of march   the end of our fiscal year 
we previously stated in the form q filed on december  and press release issued on february   that it would be unlikely that we would be able to remediate these material weaknesses before march   and unlikely that we would be able to report that our internal control over financial reporting would be effective at march  delay in filing this form k in a form b filed on june   we stated that we would not file this form k on its initial due date of june   and that we anticipated that we would file this annual report on or before june  we stated that we were then evaluating the reconciliation of certain inter company transactions at asi  and believed that asi inaccurately recorded certain inter company sales and costs with its subsidiaries during fiscal year as a result  we were not able to finalize our consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year by the due date for this form k 
we also stated that the filing of this form k was delayed because management had not then completed its assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
this form k has been filed on june  in a form k filed on june   we also indicated that we gave notice to nasdaq on june   of this delay in filing 
the nasdaq staff has orally informed us that if we file a completed form k on or before june   a panel hearing under the nasdaq letter described above will not be held and our common stock will not be delisted as a result of the june  filing date 
revision of previously announced fiscal fourth quarter and annual financial results our consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments that reduce our consolidated net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter ended march  by million to million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  previously announced in our earnings press release of may  consolidated net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was reduced by the same amount to million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  previously announced 
the reduction of the net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march  was primarily attributable to the proper recording of certain inter company sales and costs at asi 
in addition  we re classified certain service costs from selling  general and administrative expense  or sg a  to cost of sales  as well as certain foreign value added taxes from other expense to sg a 
none of these adjustments had an impact on our consolidated net loss for any prior period 
as a result of these adjustments  consolidated gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter increased to  as compared to the originally reported 
for the fiscal year ended march   consolidated gross margin decreased to  as compared to the originally reported 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we 
table of contents evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  asset impairments  restructuring charges  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment and delivery 
our primary shipping terms are fob shipping point 
therefore  revenue for these types of products is recognized when title transfers 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when the other elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
some of our other products are highly customized systems and cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from the factory 
we do not recognize revenue for these products until formal acceptance by the customer 
revenue for spare parts sales is recognized at the time of shipment and the transfer of title 
deferred revenue consists primarily of product shipments creating legally enforceable receivables that did not meet our revenue recognition policy 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities and other 
we recognize revenue for long term contracts at asi in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the percentage of completion method to calculate revenue and related costs of these contracts because they are long term in nature and estimates of cost to complete and extent of progress toward completion of long term contracts are available and reasonably dependable 
we record revenue and unbilled receivables each period based on the percentage of completion to date on each contract  measured by costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs of each contract 
the unbilled receivables amount is reclassified to trade receivables once invoice is issued 
we treat contracts as substantially complete when we receive technical acceptance of our work by the customer 
we disclose material changes in our financial results that result from changes in estimates 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition for contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion in a given period is significantly influenced by our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to produce materially reliable estimates 
however  the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
large changes in cost estimates  particularly in the bigger projects  can have a more significant effect on profitability 
we account for software revenue in accordance with the aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue for integration software work is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 

table of contents contract loss reserve we routinely evaluate the contractual commitments with our customers and suppliers to determine if it is probable that a loss exists that can be estimated in fulfillment of the contractual commitment 
if so  a loss reserve is recorded and included in accrued and other liabilities 
calculation of this loss is affected by the same uncertainties in cost estimation described above 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specifically identified amounts  as well as a portion of the reserve calculated based on the aging of receivables 
the additional reserve is provided for the remaining accounts receivable after specific allowances at a range of percentages from percent to percent based on the aging of receivables 
if circumstances change such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us or its payment trends  we may adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory which is obsolete or in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
such provisions  once established  are not reversed until the related inventories have been sold or scrapped 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we previously outsourced a majority of our fab automation product manufacturing to solectron corporation  or solectron 
as part of the arrangement  solectron purchases inventory for our benefit and we may be obligated to acquire inventory purchased by solectron if the inventory is not used over certain specified periods of time 
no revenue is recorded for the sale of inventory to solectron and any inventory buyback in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of each fiscal year using a two step process 
the first step of the test identifies when impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimate the fair value of our reporting segments that contain goodwill  based primarily on expected future cash flows  reduce the amount by the fair value of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and then compare the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeds the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense is recognized 
in connection with the annual impairment analysis for goodwill  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
warranty reserve our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a pre determined amount of time  generally to months  for material and labor to repair and service our equipment 
since fiscal year  solectron has assumed the warranty liability for the first months on products it manufactures  and we are liable for warranty obligations beyond months 
we record the estimated warranty cost upon shipment of our products or receipt of customer s final acceptance 
the estimated warranty cost is determined based on the warranty term and historical warranty costs for a specific product 
if actual product failure rates or material usage differs from our estimates  we may need to revise our estimated warranty reserve 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates due to the volatility of our industry 
if in the future we determine that 
table of contents we would be able to realize our deferred tax in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  charging income in the period such determination was made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived tangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas no 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets is based on the fair value of the assets 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs or reverse previously accrued costs 

table of contents results of operations comparison of sales  gross margin  expenses  interest other  and taxes the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangible assets restructuring and other charges asset impairment charges in process research development of acquired businesses total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net gain on sale of wafer reticle carrier products interest income interest expense other expense interest and other income expense  net loss before provision for benefit from income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations provision for benefit from income taxes minority interest net loss from continuing operations before discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss 
table of contents the following is a summary of our net sales and loss from operations by segment and consolidated total for the periods presented below in thousands fiscal year ended march  fab automation products net sales loss from operations amhs net sales income loss from operations total net sales loss from operations net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or percent  from the prior year 
the increase in fiscal year sales was primarily attributable to sales volume increase in amhs and mm smif products sold to semiconductor manufacturers 
net sales from the fab automation products segment were million  an increase of million or percent from prior year 
net sales from the amhs segment were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher sales to flat panel display  or fpd  manufacturers in fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year sales was primarily attributable to sales volume increase in amhs and mm smif products sold to semiconductor manufacturers 
excluding the impact of asi  net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  or percent  from fiscal this decrease was mainly due to the general decline in the semiconductor equipment sector and the sale of our wafer and reticle carrier product lines during fiscal year these product lines generated million of revenue in fiscal year gross margin because the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to rapid fluctuations in demand  we have made significant reductions and changes in our manufacturing operations to decrease the fixed component of our manufacturing costs and improve our margins during downturns 
in fiscal year  we continued to reduce our fixed manufacturing costs within the fab automation segment of the business even though sales increased by million compared to the prior year 
fixed manufacturing costs were reduced by million  or percent  from the prior year 
in fiscal year  we had reductions of workforce  in both us and international operations  and completed the transition of all of our us manufacturing operations to solectron 
our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march   and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal year was primarily due to gross margin improvement in the fab automation products segment 
the fiscal year gross margin for fab automation products was percent of sales compared with percent in fiscal year the gross margin improvement was 
table of contents attributable to continued product cost reductions through outsourced manufacturing and a lower cost supply chain 
the fiscal year gross margin for amhs was percent compared with percent in fiscal year the decrease of percent in amhs gross margin was due to the increase in mix of flat panel display sales that had lower margins than semiconductor sales 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to product mix change resulting from higher amhs revenue with lower gross margins  along with the recognition of contract losses and inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory by asi 
we expect mm product sales to continue to increase as a percentage of our sales mix  although quarterly fluctuations are likely 
our mm fab automation products face greater competition and currently have lower margins compared with our mm products 
swings in product mix may impact our gross margins on a quarter over quarter basis 
through cost reduction initiatives and our outsourcing strategy  we expect mm gross margins to improve over time  although we expect price competition to continue 
we expect continued declines in our mm product sales in the next fiscal year as bookings in our key markets in china and elsewhere have slowed down 
our gross margin will continue to be affected by future changes in product mix and net sales volumes  as well as market and price competition 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in research and development spending in fiscal years and was mainly attributable to headcount reductions and discretionary spending cuts 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march   and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the million increase in fiscal year expenses was primarily due to higher accounting and compliance costs  and costs associated with our review  documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting required under the sarbanes oxley act of also contributing to the fiscal year increase was approximately million for accounting and legal costs related to the fiscal year second quarter delay in closing asi s books  delayed filing of the second fiscal quarter form q and resulting nasdaq listing qualifications hearing process  and the audit committee s investigation and restatement 
higher expenses also reflect the increased spending on consultants to implement business process improvements 
the decreases in fiscal year resulted primarily from workforce reductions  facility closures  and reduced discretionary spending offset by increases due to acquisitions of asi and of domainlogix corporation  or dlc  a delaware corporation 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expenses relating to acquired intangible assets were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march   and million for the fiscal year ended march  we amortize acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from three to ten years 
the increases in amortization expenses in fiscal years and were primarily due to the acquisition of the asi joint venture interest in fiscal year 
table of contents restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows in thousands severance excess fixed asset and benefits facility impairment total balance  march  additional accruals non cash related adjustments amounts paid in cash balance  march  additional accruals non cash related adjustments amounts paid in cash balance  march  additional accruals amounts paid in cash foreign currency translation adjustment balance  march  in fiscal year  we recorded net severance and other charges of million  primarily for severance costs from a reduction in workforce in december in december  we announced a restructuring initiative in our fab automation reporting segment  which involved the termination of employment of approximately employees  including in manufacturing  in selling  general and administration  and from our international operations 
the total costs of this restructuring were approximately million in termination benefits 
the restructuring is expected to provide annual expense savings of approximately to million  beginning in fiscal year the outstanding accrual balance of million at march  consists primarily of future lease obligations on vacated facilities  in excess of estimated future sublease proceeds  of approximately million  which will be paid over the next two fiscal years and severance payments relating to december restructuring  which are expected to be paid within the next fiscal quarter 
all remaining accrual balances are expected to be settled in cash 
in fiscal year  we recorded net severance and other charges of million  primarily related to million in severance costs from a reduction in workforce in april  and a million charge related to the settlement and release of claims arising from the termination of a former officer 
included also were million of severance expenses  primarily from headcount reductions in our japanese operations 
in addition to the severance charges  we recorded million for exiting a facility in connection with our restructuring activities and for future lease obligations on a vacated facility in excess of estimated future sublease proceeds 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we terminated the employment of approximately employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development and in selling  general and administration  from our us as well as international operations 
in fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million related to excess facilities that we had under lease but had abandoned as a result of our decision to outsource our manufacturing activities  and an excess facility charge of million reflecting revised estimates of reduced future sublease income based on continued weakness in the austin  texas commercial real estate market 
we also recorded severance charges of million resulting from headcount reductions and contractual obligations of million as a result of workforce reduction measures 
the restructuring activities affected approximately employees in manufacturing  sales  research and development and administrative staff  including approximately employees who 
table of contents joined solectron 
we also recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million for assets abandoned due to facility consolidation and the integration of certain programs into asi 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended march  goodwill and intangible impairment land and building impairment totals in the fiscal year ended march   we removed from service and made available for sale certain land and a building relating to our japanese subsidiary  aji 
the building had been underutilized since a prior decision to outsource the manufacturing of our next generation robotics products  part of an overall strategy to outsource the manufacture of all our fab automation system products 
the outsourcing transition is substantially complete and remaining personnel and operations have been consolidated into other facilities 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write the assets down to their estimated fair value  based on a market valuation  less estimated cost to sell 
we expect to complete the sale of the land and building within the next fiscal year 
in the fiscal year ended march   we completed the sale of land in fremont  california 
the net proceeds from the sale were million 
we had intended to construct corporate headquarters facilities on the land and subsequently decided not to build these facilities 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million write down based on our latest estimate of market value as supported by the pending sale agreement at the time 
we previously entered into a purchase agreement in september to sell the land for million  net of selling expenses  which was expected to close in the quarter ended december  this transaction did not close 
as a result  a million write down was recorded in the second quarter in fiscal year initially  we leased the land from a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to an original lease agreement dated june   which was subsequently amended on february  and may  we purchased the land on october  for million  and we paid the syndicate of financial institutions approximately million for engineering costs incurred in preparation for making leasehold improvements to the land 
based upon market data at june  and our non cancelable commitment to purchase the land  we estimated that the then market value of the land had been impaired and recorded a million write down to its estimated market value in fiscal year in the fiscal year ended march   we completed an annual goodwill impairment test and determined that impairment charges of million were required because the estimated fair value of certain businesses were less than their book values 
the charges were measured by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which we believed approximated fair value  with their corresponding book values 
the charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with our may acquisition of dlc 
in process research and development costs of acquired businesses and product lines in october  we acquired percent of the common stock of asi  our japanese joint venture company 
in connection with the purchase price allocation in the quarter ended december   we assigned million to in process research and development  or ipr d 
in june  we acquired dlc 
in connection with the purchase price allocation  million was assigned to ipr d 
we identified research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the products once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion analysis to the calculated value 

table of contents gain on sale of wafer and reticle carrier product line in fiscal year  we sold our wafer and reticle carrier  or wrc  products to entegris for net proceeds of million 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a gain on sale of million 
the wafer and reticle carrier products had contributed revenues of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
interest and other income expense  net excluding gain on sale of wafer and recticle carrier product line interest and other income expense  net was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march   and million  excluding gain on sale of wrc  for the fiscal year ended march  the amount in fiscal year primarily consisted of a million interest expense including million of amortization of debt issuance costs  and million loss on foreign exchange  which was offset partially by million royalty income  million interest income and million other income 
the million decrease from fiscal year was primarily attributable to million increase in royalty income  million decrease in foreign exchange loss  million increase in interest income  million decrease in interest expense and million decrease in other expenses 
the amount for the fiscal year ended march  was relatively flat from the prior year 
provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march   or percent of our loss before income taxes  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march   or percent of our loss before income taxes 
the tax benefit is primarily due to amortization of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the asi acquisition of million  offset by tax provisions in our international subsidiaries 
as a result of the review undertaken at september   we concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
we therefore recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal year we recorded an effective tax rate of percent for the fiscal year ended march   percent for the fiscal year ended march   and percent for the fiscal year ended march  in fiscal year  we determined that under applicable accounting principles  based on our history of consecutive losses since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for our net deferred tax assets in the united states 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to percent of the amount of these assets 
if we determine in the future that we would be able to realize our deferred tax in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
minority interest minority interest in the net income loss of our subsidiaries was million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
this amount represents the percent share of our joint venture partner  shinko  in the operations of asi 
discontinued operations  net of income tax there were no discontinued operations in fiscal years and loss from discontinued operations was million for the fiscal year ended march  in august  we announced our intention to divest two subsidiaries  amp and semifab  in order to allow us to focus better on our core business 
both subsidiaries were divested in march related party transactions at march   we did not hold any outstanding loans due to us from current employees 
at march   we held notes from two then current non officer employees totaling million 
at 
table of contents march   we held notes from two former employees and two then current employees totaling million 
our majority owned subsidiary  asi  has certain transactions with its minority shareholder  shinko 
our majority owned subsidiary  aji  has certain transactions with mecs korea  in which aji is a minority shareholder 
at march  and  significant balances with shinko and mecs korea were in thousands march  accounts payable due to shinko accrued liabilities due to shinko accounts receivable from mecs korea accounts payable due to mecs korea in addition  the consolidated financial statements reflect that asi purchased various products  installation  administrative and it services from shinko 
aji also purchased it services from mecs korea 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  sales to and purchases from shinko and mecs were in thousands fiscal year ended march  material purchases from shinko services purchased from shinko sales to mecs korea services purchased from mecs korea guarantees and commitments as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are liable as part of the asi acquisition to provide funding for plan benefits under asi s pension plan 
as part of the acquisition of asi in october  we recorded million of pension related obligations 
as of march  and  the liability was million and million  respectively

eitf provides guidance for identifying impaired investments and new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
on september   the fasb issued a final staff position  or fsp  eitf issue that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs through of eitf quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by eitf remain unchanged by the staff position 
we do not believe the impact of adoption of the measurement provisions of the eitf will be significant to our overall results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of the statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
and believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of the statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards  including purchases made under an employee stock purchase plan 
under a change approved by the sec in april  the effective date of this requirement for us will be april   the beginning of our next fiscal year that begins after june  in march  the sec issued sab which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r and have not selected a transition method or valuation model 
however  in any event  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant adverse impact on our results from operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities and public stock offerings  bank borrowings  long term debt and cash generated from operations 
see also risk factors we experienced additional risks and costs as a result of the delayed filing of the form q for our fiscal second quarter and delayed filing of this form k for additional information on our ability to raise funds 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and million in long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in addition  as of march   we had approximately million in short term investments 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal year was million 
it was primarily due to a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable  net of million and deferred taxes of million  and increase in inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other assets of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred margin of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million  asset impairment charges of million  stock based compensation charges of million  loss on fixed assets disposals of million and the minority interest in the net income of our subsidiaries of million 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal year was million 
it was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  increases in accounts receivable  net of million  primarily due to significantly higher revenue  an increase in inventory of million  deferred taxes of million and minority interest loss allocations of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  asset impairment charges of million  stock based compensation charges of million  loss on disposal of fixed assets of million and non cash restructuring charges of million 
additionally  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred margin increased by a combined million  primarily due to increased purchasing activities to support higher revenue 
we continue to improve our days sales outstanding  or dso  which have decreased to days at march  from days at march  for billed and unbilled receivables 
the improvement in dso was primarily due to better cash collections from sales 
the increase in unbilled receivables at march  compared to march  was attributable to the increase in revenues of asi  primarily recognized 
table of contents under the percentage of completion method 
the significant increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at march  over those of march  was mainly attributable to larger balances at asi to support growth in the business 
our inventory turns were times for the fiscal year  compared to times for fiscal year  primarily due to increased demand for our products 
we expect that cash used in or provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  collection of accounts receivable  timing of payments  and inventory levels 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million 
it was due to million in purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of property and equipment  primarily fixed assets for research and development and customer demonstration units  partially offset by million in proceeds from sales of short term investments and million in proceeds from the release of restricted cash and cash equivalents  as the restriction lapsed due to the repayment of the related debt in the first quarter of fiscal year net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of land and million from sale or maturity of short term investments and restricted cash equivalents 
this source of cash was offset by purchases of short term investments of million  purchase of property and equipment of million and cash used in connection with our acquisition of asyst shinko america  a subsidiary of asi of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million  due to million in proceeds from our line of credit and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock programs  partially offset by million in pay downs against borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million  primarily resulting from a total of million from issuance of common stock 
of this million  million was through our common stock offering and the remaining million was from our employee stock programs 
proceeds from this issuance were used in the repayment of million against our commercial banking line of credit 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock  including exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at an offering price to the public of per share 
we received total proceeds of million  net of the related issuance fees and costs 
on july   we completed the sale of million of percent convertible subordinated notes that resulted in aggregate proceeds of million to us  net of issuance costs 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes mature on july   pay interest on january and july of each year  and are redeemable at our option at any time prior to maturity 
debt issuance costs of million  net of amortization  are being amortized over months and are being charged to other income expense  net 
debt amortization costs totaled million for each of the fiscal years ended march  and we owed million and million under secured straight bonds to a bank in japan at march  and  respectively 
the bonds bore interest at rates ranging from percent to percent and percent to percent as of march  and  respectively  and mature in fiscal year certain of our assets in japan have been pledged as security for short term debt and secured straight bonds 
at march   we had available to us a million two year revolving line of credit with a commercial bank  as amended during the first quarter of fiscal year the amended line of credit requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including a quarterly net income loss target  calculated on an 
table of contents after tax basis excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  and a requirement that we maintain a balance of cash and cash equivalents in the united states during the term of the line of credit of at least million  at least million of which must be held with the bank 
in addition  the amendment extended the line of credit through may   changed and expanded the base of assets under which we qualify for borrowing under the line of credit and reduced certain fees and interest charges applicable to borrowing under the line of credit 
the specific amount of borrowing available under the line of credit at any time  however  may change based on the amount of current receivables we have outstanding  in addition to the cash balance held at the bank 
the line of credit was fully paid down during the year ended march  as of march   and the date of this report  there was no amount outstanding under the line of credit 
as of the date of this report  we were in compliance with the financial covenants 
in june  we further amended the line of credit to extend its maturity to july  the maximum borrowing available under the amended line is million  however  only million of borrowing is available as long as asi maintains million of aggregate available borrowing under its lines of credit in japan 
the total borrowing available to us under the line of credit will be increased incrementally from million to a maximum of million to the extent asi s aggregate available borrowing under its lines of credit in japan is reduced from million 
the line of credit  as further amended  increases from million to million the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we are required to maintain with the bank during the term  and increases from million to million the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we must maintain during the term in us bank accounts which may include the cash and cash equivalents maintained with the bank 
the amended line of credit also reduces certain fees and adjusts the levels of permitted indebtedness at asi during the term 
at march   asi had three revolving lines of credit with japanese banks 
these lines allow aggregate borrowing of up to billion japanese yen  or approximately million at the exchange rate as of march  as of march  and  respectively  asi had outstanding borrowings of billion japanese yen and billion japanese yen  or approximately million and million  respectively  at the exchange rate as of march  and  respectively  that is recorded in short term debt 
asi s lines of credit carry original terms of six months to one year  at variable interest rates based on the tokyo interbank offered rate  or tibor  which was percent at march   plus margins of to percent 
under terms of these lines of credit  asi generally is required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  including requirements to report an annual net profit on a statutory basis and to maintain at least percent of the equity reported as of its prior fiscal year end 
asi was in compliance with these covenants at march  none of these lines require collateral and none of these lines require guarantees from asyst or its other subsidiaries in the event of default by asi 
in june  we amended two of these lines representing billion yen  or approximately million  of borrowing capacity to extend the expiry dates to june   at which time all amounts outstanding under these lines will be due and payable  unless the lines are extended 
a third line representing billion yen  or approximately million  of borrowing capacity is due to expire in november  at which time any amounts outstanding will be due and payable  unless the line is extended 
our japanese subsidiary  aji  maintains revolving lines of credit with five japanese banks 
the lines carry annual interest rates of to percent and substantially all of these lines are guaranteed by the company in the united states 
as of march  and  respectively  aji had outstanding borrowings of billion japanese yen and billion japanese yen  or approximately million and million  at exchange rates as of march  and  respectively  that are recorded as short term debt 
we lease facilities under non cancelable capital and operating leases  with expiration dates up to april since inception  we have incurred aggregate consolidated net losses of approximately million  and have incurred losses during four of the last five years 
in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregated million at march  we believe that our current cash position and the 
table of contents availability of additional financing via existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements through march  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry may result in short term uses of cash in operations as cash may be used to finance additional working capital requirements such as accounts receivable and inventories 
alternatively  continuation or further softening of demand for our products may cause us to fund additional losses in the future 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes 
we may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or the sale of assets 
these financings may not be available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or  if available  on terms acceptable to us or not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego investments  which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business 
as a result of the late filing of the fiscal second quarter form q  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others for one year 
the inability to use form s could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period 
if we fail to timely file a future periodic report with the sec and were delisted  it could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity 
however  we are still eligible to register our securities on form s in addition  the matters we have reported in this item under overview internal control matters and in item a of this form k may also have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain future capital from equity or debt 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing or other risks that could arise if we had such relationships 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term loans and notes payable long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations defined benefit pension plan obligations total only non cancelable purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are included in the table above 

table of contents risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements about our future plans  objectives  intentions and expectations 
many factors  including those described below  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
risks related to our business we have a history of significant losses 
we have a history of significant losses 
in the last five fiscal years  we were profitable in only fiscal year for the year ended march   our net loss and accumulated deficit was million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  for fiscal year we may also continue to experience significant losses in the future 
if we continue to fail to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis  our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected 
we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii  item a of this form k 
if we fail to do so  our business  results of operations or financial condition and the value of our stock could be materially harmed 
additional information concerning the matters discussed under this risk factor is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  the overview portion of this item and item a 
the information below should be read in conjunction with that additional information 
we were unable to file the form q on time for our fiscal second quarter for fiscal year due to our inability to complete the financial closing process at asi on a timely basis  primarily relating to asi s inability to provide timely reconciliation and reporting of inventory and cost information  and a customer dispute which arose from internal information alleging that an improper payment was offered by an asi employee to a customer employee 
in the process of closing asi s books  we identified material accounting errors in asi s fiscal first quarter results  which led to our determination to restate those results in a form q a filed on december   the same date that we filed the form q for our fiscal second quarter 
additionally  the company made adjustments to the fiscal first quarter results reported for ati  our base business  to reflect the deferral of certain new product related revenue that had been recognized in the quarter and to reduce amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we were unable to file this form k on its initial due date of june   due to our then ongoing evaluation of the reconciliation of certain inter company transactions at asi 
as a result  we were not able to finalize our consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year by the due date for this form k 
we also stated that filing of this form k was delayed because management had not then completed its assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
due to internal control deficiencies related to the above circumstances and other factors  we concluded in item a of this form k that material weaknesses existed as of march   and therefore that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of that date 
our independent registered public accounting firm also concluded in its attestation report that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of march   which is included in its audit opinion set forth in item of this form k 
the material weaknesses we have reported in item a relating both to asi and our consolidated operations create risks that in the future we may not be able to make timely filings of reports we must file with the sec and that we may have to restate previously reported results 
we are devoting now and will likely need 
table of contents to continue to devote significant resources in the near future to increasing the number and qualifications of our finance and accounting staff in japan and the united states and otherwise carrying out the remedial measures discussed in item a 
we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful or will be completed in time to achieve effective controls and procedures  or to avoid future filing delays  unexpected and material expenses  or other adverse consequences 
in addition  while we hold majority ownership of asi  certain operational decisions require the approval and support of our joint venture partner  shinko electric co  ltd  or shinko  and the future success of asi depends in significant part on the strength of our relationship with shinko  our ability to coordinate with shinko changes and improvements in asi s operating and business process  and shinko s willingness to support changes and improvements including changes which may impact benefits to shinko as an existing and significant supplier of component parts to asi 
it is possible that governmental agencies within or outside the us could investigate the matters summarized above and seek legal sanctions against us or some of our employees 
we may also become subject to private lawsuits filed against us and or our management as a result of these matters 
our current and future results of operations may be adversely affected by significant costs related to our investigation of and remedial measures relating to these matters and  if applicable  any governmental investigations or actions or private lawsuits that may arise 
in addition  asi s operations  and business and customer relations  and  as a consequence  our consolidated results and financial condition  could be negatively impacted by management and other changes necessitated by the remediation plan described in part ii  item a 
we experienced additional risks and costs as a result of the delayed filing of the form q for our fiscal second quarter and delayed filing of this form k 
as a result of the delayed filing of form q for our second quarter of fiscal year described in the overview portion of this item  we experienced additional risks and costs 
the related audit committee investigation was time consuming  required us to incur significant incremental expenses and affected management s attention and resources 
further  the measures to strengthen internal controls being implemented continued to require and will likely require in the future greater management time and company resources to implement and monitor 
we incurred approximately million in costs associated with the matters underlying the audit committee s investigation in fiscal year in december  we appeared before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel to discuss our filing delay relating to the form q for the second fiscal quarter 
on january   the panel approved our request to continue the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
while the panel determined that the company then appeared to satisfy nasdaq s filing requirement  the panel stated it would continue to monitor us to ensure our compliance with the filing requirements over the long term 
the panel also determined to condition asyst s continued listing upon our timely filing all periodic reports with the sec and nasdaq for all reporting periods ending on or before january  if we fail to make any periodic report filing in accordance with this condition  the panel decision stated that a nasdaq panel will promptly conduct a hearing with respect to such failure  and our securities may be immediately delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
as a result of our delayed filing on december  of the form q for fiscal second quarter initially due november   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of for one year 
the inability to use form s could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies during this period 
because we filed this form k no later than june   this report is considered timely under sec rules 
the nasdaq staff has orally informed us that by filing a completed form k on or before june   a panel hearing under the nasdaq letter described above would not be held and our common stock would not be delisted as a result of the june  filing date 
finally  the matters leading to the delay in filing this form k on its initial due date have created further risks and costs 
although our filing of this form k on or before june  has avoided to date a further delinquency notice from nasdaq under the panel decision described above  these facts could negatively 
table of contents affect any outcome of a future late filing or other unforeseen listing standard delinquencies under the nasdaq hearing panel procedures 
we also incurred since march   approximately million of unexpected expenses in connection with our review and analysis of the inter company reconciliation matter at asi that delayed our financial close process and the retention of an outside consulting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist with our reporting process for this form k and related internal control assessment 
if we fail to manage effectively our asi joint venture  our sales of automated material handling systems could be adversely affected and the sales mix between amhs and our other products could affect our overall financial performance 
net sales of automated material handling systems  or amhs  accounted for approximately percent and percent of our net sales for the years ended march  and  respectively  and are expected to be an important component of our future sales 
substantially all of our amhs sales are through our majority owned joint venture subsidiary  asi  of which we acquired percent in the third quarter of fiscal year while we hold majority ownership of asi  certain operational decisions require the approval and support of our joint venture partner  shinko electric co  ltd  or shinko  and the future success of asi depends in significant part on the strength of our relationship with shinko and ability to coordinate improvements in asi s operating and business process with shinko 
other than a right of first refusal if shinko is proposing to sell some or its entire stake in asi  or in certain instances constituting a material default by shinko  we have no mechanism to compel a sale to us of the percent of asi that is currently owned by shinko 
even if shinko were to offer to sell its stake in asi to us  or the shares were otherwise available to us for purchase by right of first refusal  we may not have sufficient funds available to facilitate such acquisition or may not elect to purchase the shares 
further  if we were to determine to sell our stake in asi to shinko or a third party  we may not recognize proceeds from the sale equal to our original investment 
in addition  we have limited experience managing operations in japan  and our failure to manage effectively asi in japan could harm our business 
orders for amhs are relatively large  often exceeding million for a given project 
because of the size of these orders  our revenues are often concentrated among a small number of customers in any fiscal period 
additionally  the manufacture and installation of these systems at our customers manufacturing facilities can take up to six months 
accordingly  we recognize revenue and costs for amhs based on percentage of completion analysis because the contracts are long term in nature 
payments under these contracts often occur well after we incur our manufacturing costs 
for example  terms for some of our japanese amhs customers typically require payment to be made six months after customer acceptance and in some cases longer 
the consequence of the amhs payment cycle is that significant demands can be placed on our working capital  prior to our receipt of customer payments 
further  gross margins on our amhs sales are lower than those for our other products 
if we fail to estimate effectively costs and manage these long term projects  we could have loss contract exposure and additional gross margin pressure 
at march   we had a loss contract reserve of million related to four amhs contracts  three of which were entered into by asi in fiscal year and one of which was entered into by asi in fiscal year our overall financial performance will therefore be affected by the sales mix between amhs and other products and our ability to manage amhs projects in a given period 
if we are unable to increase our sales of amhs to fpd manufacturers  or if the fpd industry enters a cyclical downturn  our growth prospects could be negatively affected 
in recent quarters  asi has begun to sell amhs to flat panel display  or fpd  manufacturers 
while we believe sales to the fpd industry present a significant opportunity for growth  the size of this market opportunity depends in large part on capital expenditures by fpd manufacturers 
the market for fpd products is highly cyclical and has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in unpredictable demand for manufacturing and automation equipment 
if the fpd market enters into a cyclical downturn  demand for amhs by the fpd market may be significantly reduced  impacting our growth prospects 

table of contents as a relatively new entrant to the fpd equipment market  we do not have the customer relationships our competitors have 
similarly  our relative inexperience in the fpd industry may cause us to misjudge important trends and dynamics in this market 
if we are unable to anticipate future customer needs in the fpd market  our growth prospects may be severely affected 
our gross margins on mm products may be lower than on mm products  which could adversely affect our ability to become and remain profitable 
the gross margins on our mm products currently are not as favorable as on our mm products 
this is primarily because we face increased competition in this product line  and we sell a greater percentage of our mm products to oems rather than directly to semiconductor manufacturers 
manufacturing costs are generally higher in the early stages of new product introduction and typically decrease as demand increases  due to better economies of scale and efficiencies developed in the manufacturing processes 
we cannot  however  assure that we will see such economies of scale and efficiencies in our future manufacturing of mm products  which will be supplied primarily by contract manufacturers 
semi standards for mm products have enabled more suppliers to enter our markets  thereby increasing competition and creating pricing pressure 
while semiconductor manufacturers purchased a majority of mm tool automation products  oems are purchasing most of the tool automation products for mm 
sales to oems typically have lower gross margins 
these factors may prevent us from achieving or maintaining similar relative pricing and gross margin performance on mm products as we have achieved on mm products  and could adversely affect our ability to become and remain profitable 
most of our manufacturing is outsourced and we rely on a single contract manufacturer for much of our fab automation product manufacturing  which could disrupt the availability of our fab automation products and adversely affect our gross margins 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of most of our fab automation products 
solectron currently manufactures  under a long term contract  our products  other than amhs and our japanese robotics products 
asi also subcontracts a significant portion of its amhs manufacturing to third parties 
in the future  we may increase our dependence on contract manufacturers 
outsourcing may not yield the benefits we expect  and instead could result in increased product costs and product delivery delays 
outsourced manufacturing could create disruptions in the availability of our products if the timeliness or quality of products delivered does not meet our requirements or our customers expectations 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in receiving products from solectron 
problems with quality or timeliness could be caused by a number of factors including  but not limited to manufacturing process flow issues  financial viability of an outsourced vendor  availability of raw materials or components to the outsourced vendor  improper product specifications  and the learning curve to commence manufacturing at a new outsourced site 
our contract with solectron contains minimum purchase commitments which  if not met  could result in increased costs  which would adversely affect our gross margins 
we must also provide solectron with forecasts and targets based on actual and anticipated demand  which we may not be able to do effectively or efficiently 
if solectron purchases inventory based on our forecasts  and that inventory is not used  we must repurchase the unused inventory  which would adversely affect both our cash flows and gross margins 
if product supply is adversely affected because of problems in outsourcing  we may lose sales and profits 
our outsourcing agreement with solectron includes commitments from solectron to adjust  up and down  manufacturing volume based on updates to our forecast demand 
solectron may be unable to meet these commitments however and  even if it can  may be unable to react efficiently to rapid fluctuations in demand 
if our agreement with solectron terminates  or if solectron does not perform its obligations under our agreement  it could take several months to establish alternative manufacturing for these products and we may not be able to fulfill our customers orders for most of our products in a timely manner 
if our agreement with solectron terminates  we may be unable to find another suitable outsource manufacturer 

table of contents any delays in meeting customer demand or quality problems resulting from product manufactured at an outsourced location such as solectron could result in lost or reduced future sales to key customers and could have a material negative impact on our net sales  gross profits and results of operations 
shortages of components necessary for product assembly by solectron or us can delay shipments to our customers and can lead to increased costs  which may negatively impact our financial results 
when demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is strong  suppliers  both us and international  strain to provide components on a timely basis 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of many of our products  and disruption or termination of supply sources to our contract manufacturers or us could have a serious adverse effect on our operations 
many of the components and subassemblies used in our products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases may come from a single supplier 
a prolonged inability to obtain some components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could result in damage to our customer relationships 
shortages of components may also result in price increases for components and  as a result  could decrease our margins and negatively impact our financial results 
we have significant existing debts  the restrictive covenants under some of our debt agreements may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy  if we are forced to prepay some or all of this indebtedness our financial position would be severely and adversely affected 
we have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness 
at march   our long term debt was million  of which million represents current portion of long term debt recorded under current liabilities  and our short term debt was million  for an aggregate of million 
this includes million of percent convertible subordinated notes outstanding which are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
we are required to pay interest on these convertible notes on january and july of each year 
these convertible notes mature july   and are redeemable at our option after july  as of march   asi has three revolving lines of credit with japanese banks under which it may borrow up to billion japanese yen  or approximately million  and of which billion japanese yen  or approximately million was outstanding as of march  we have also guaranteed substantially all of the loans of our japanese subsidiary  aji  which loans currently total approximately million as of march  our million two year revolving line of credit with a commercial bank was amended during the first quarter of fiscal year to increase the total borrowing available to a maximum of million  subject to certain conditions 
the amended line of credit requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including a quarterly net income loss target  calculated on an after tax basis excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  and a requirement that we maintain during the term million of cash and cash equivalents with the bank and million in us bank accounts during the term which may include the cash and cash equivalents maintained with the bank 
the specific amount of the line of credit available at any time  however  may change based on the amount of current receivables we have outstanding  the amount of aggregate borrowing available to asi under its line of credit in japan  and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents maintained at the bank 
the covenants contained in our line of credit with the bank also restrict our ability to take certain actions  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions in respect of our capital stock  redeem capital stock  make investments or other restricted payments  engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates  create liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  
table of contents make payments on our debt  other than in the ordinary course  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
while we have experienced improvements in our financial results for fiscal year  we cannot assure you that we will meet the financial covenants contained in our line of credit with the bank in subsequent quarters 
specifically  we may be unable to meet the minimum net income covenant or the minimum liquidity covenant in future quarters 
if we are unable to meet any covenants  we cannot assure you the bank will grant waivers and amend the covenants  or that the bank will not terminate the line of credit  preclude further borrowings or require us to repay any outstanding borrowings 
under the terms of its bank facilities  asi must generate operating profits on a statutory basis and must maintain a minimum level of equity 
additionally  under the terms of its bank facilities  aji s loans may be called upon an event of default  the japanese banks may call the loans outstanding at aji  requiring immediate repayment  which we have guaranteed 
as long as our indebtedness remains outstanding  the restrictive covenants could impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies or obtain additional funding 
forced prepayment of some or all of our indebtedness would reduce our available cash balances and have an adverse impact on our operating and financial performance 
we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs  if we do need to secure financing  it may not be available on favorable terms 
we raised capital of million by issuing million shares of our common stock in a public offering in november  however  our operations are currently consuming cash and may do so in the future 
as a consequence  in the future we may be required to seek additional financing to meet our working capital needs and to finance capital expenditures  as well as to fund operations 
as a result of our delayed filing of the form q for our second quarter of fiscal year  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of for one year 
the inability to use form s could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period 
additionally  we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all  or which is not dilutive to our shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to limitations on our operations 
this strain on our capital resources could adversely affect our business 
if our fully integrated tool front end solutions are not widely accepted  our growth prospects could be negatively affected 
the decision by oems to adopt our tool front end  or portal  solutions for a large product line involves significant organizational  technological and financial commitments by the oems 
oems expect the portal solutions to meet stringent design  reliability and delivery specifications 
if we fail to satisfy these expectations  whether based on limited or expanded sales levels  oems will not adopt our portal solutions 
we cannot ensure that these tools will be widely accepted in the marketplace  that additional oems will adopt them  or that our products will command pricing sufficient to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have invested significant time and expense in the development of spartan  our next generation portal offering specifically designed for the mm market 
while we believe spartan may improve our competitive position and gross margins in the mm industry  if the market acceptance of spartan is less than our forecast  or if the timing of this acceptance is delayed  our financial performance could be impacted 
further  because spartan is early in its production life  its manufacturing costs may be higher and resulting margins may be lower than those of existing or legacy products 
notwithstanding our portal solutions  oems may purchase components to 
table of contents assemble or invest in the development of their own comparable portals 
if our solutions are not adopted by oems  our prospects will be negatively impacted and we may not be able to achieve profitability 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers  and our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders 
accordingly our customers can cease purchasing our products at any time  without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
customer orders are often received with extremely short lead times 
if we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner  we could lose sales and customers 
we depend on large purchases from a few significant customers  and any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
the markets in which we sell our products comprise a relatively small number of oems and semiconductor and fpd manufacturers 
large orders from a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue and make our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
the sales cycles to new customers range from six to twelve months from initial inquiry to placement of an order  depending on the complexity of the project 
these extended sales cycles make the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
a significant portion of the net sales in any quarter is typically derived from a small number of long term  multi million dollar customer projects involving upgrades of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities 
generally  our customers may cancel or reschedule shipments with limited or no penalty 
our customers demand for our products is largely driven by the timing of new fab construction and the upgrading of existing fabs initiated by those customers 
as such  when we complete projects for a customer  business from that customer will decline substantially unless it undertakes additional projects incorporating our products 
the high cost of building a fab is causing increasing numbers of semiconductor manufacturers to outsource the manufacturing of their semiconductors to foundries 
this trend toward foundry outsourcing  combined with increasing consolidation within the semiconductor industry  could continue to decrease the number of our potential customers and increase our dependency on our remaining customers 
we may not be able to retain our largest customers or attract additional customers  and our oem customers may not be successful in selling the oem equipment in which our systems are embedded 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers 
in addition  our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us and may continue to do so in the future  particularly during downturns in the semiconductor market 
further  our current and prospective customers have exerted pressure on us to shorten delivery times and to customize and improve the capabilities of our products  thus increasing our manufacturing costs 
in addition  some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors 
failure to respond adequately to such pressures could result in a loss of customers or orders and the inability to develop successful relationships with new customers  which would have a negative impact on our business 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively affected 
in addition  since each customer represents a significant percentage of net sales  the timing of the completion of an order and the promptness of customer payment can lead to a fluctuation in our quarterly results 

table of contents if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner  our business could be negatively affected 
semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes 
the development of more complex semiconductors has driven the need for new facilities  equipment and processes to produce these devices at an acceptable cost 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing products to meet customer needs and to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
we often require long lead times for development of our products  which requires us to expend significant management effort and to incur material development costs and other expenses 
during development periods we may not realize corresponding revenue in the same period  or at all 
we may not succeed with our product development efforts and we may not respond effectively to technological change  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the impact could include charges to operating expense  cost overruns on large projects or the loss of future revenue opportunities 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and we may become involved in litigation concerning the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret and copyright protection to establish and protect our intellectual property 
while we intend to take reasonable steps to protect our patent rights  the filing process is time consuming and we cannot assure you that we will be able to file timely our patents and other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you our patents and other intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated or avoided  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
we also rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  or our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or independently developed by  others 
in addition  enforcement of our rights could impose significant expense and result in an uncertain or non cost effective determination or confirmation of our rights 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we do infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to intellectual property rights of others or to alter our products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical  could detract from the value of our products  or could delay our ability to meet customer demands or opportunities 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  to protect our trade secrets or know how  to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others  or to determine the scope and validity of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of our management  which by itself could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in any litigation could result in our loss of intellectual property rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these effects could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the intellectual property laws in asia do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
it may be necessary for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our  or our competitors  intellectual property rights in asia  which could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
if we are unable to defend our intellectual property rights in asia  our future business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents we may not be able to integrate efficiently the operations of our acquisitions  and may incur substantial losses in the divestiture of assets or operations 
we have made and may continue to make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  technologies or market access 
if we are to realize the anticipated benefits of past and future acquisitions or investments  the operations of these companies must be integrated and combined efficiently with our own 
the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  computer and accounting systems  and other aspects of operations  while managing a larger entity  will continue to present a significant challenge to our management 
in addition  it is not certain that we will be able to incorporate different financial and reporting controls  processes  systems and technologies into our existing business environment 
the difficulties of integration may increase because of the necessity of combining personnel with varied business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures and objectives 
we may incur substantial costs associated with these activities and we may suffer other material adverse effects from these integration efforts which could materially reduce our earnings  even over the long term 
we may not succeed with the integration process and we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the business combinations  or we could decide to divest or discontinue existing or recently acquired assets or operations 
for example  in fiscal year  we decided to discontinue operations of our semifab and amp subsidiaries  both of which we had acquired in february  as these subsidiaries were generating significant operating losses and were not considered critical to our long term strategy 
these subsidiaries were sold at the end of fiscal year at a substantial loss 
the dedication of management resources to such integration or divestitures may detract attention from the day to day business  and we may need to hire additional management personnel to mange our acquisitions or divestitures successfully 
as our quarterly and yearly operating results are subject to variability  comparisons between periods may not be meaningful  this variability in our results could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues and operating results can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year  depending on factors such as general trends in the overall economy  electronics industry and semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries  fluctuations in the semiconductor and fpd equipment markets  changes in customer buying patterns  the degree of competition we face  the size  timing and product mix of customer orders  lost sales due to any failure in the outsourcing of our manufacturing  the availability of key components  the timing of product shipment and acceptance  which are factors in determining when we recognize revenue  and the timely introduction and acceptance of new products 
these and other factors increase the risk of unplanned fluctuations in our net sales 
a shortfall in net sales in a quarter or a fiscal year as a result of these and other factors could negatively impact our operating results for that period 
given these factors  we expect quarter to quarter and year to year performance to fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
as a result  period to period comparisons of our performance may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
in one or more future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters  power loss  strikes and other events beyond our control  which would adversely affect our business 
we conduct a significant portion of our activities including manufacturing  administration and data processing at facilities located in the state of california  japan and other seismically active areas that have experienced major earthquakes in the past  as well as other natural disasters 
we do not carry any earthquake insurance for our operations in the united states and only limited coverage for our operations in japan 
such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 
in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting our facilities  it could significantly disrupt our operations  delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment for the time required to repair  rebuild or replace our outsourced manufacturing facilities  which could be lengthy  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities 
in addition  our facilities  particularly in the state of california  may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies 
such shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts  which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business 
in addition  our products are typically shipped from a limited number of ports  and any natural disaster  strike or other event blocking shipment from such ports could delay or prevent shipments and harm our business 
in addition  we do not have a business continuity plan in place 
any business interruption would adversely affect our operations 
we face significant economic and regulatory risks because a majority of our net sales are derived from outside the united states 
a significant portion of our net sales is attributable to sales outside the united states  primarily in taiwan  japan  china  korea  singapore and europe 
international sales were percent for fiscal year  percent for fiscal year  and percent for fiscal year we expect that international sales  particularly to asia  will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
concentration in sales to customers outside the united states increases our exposure to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the imposition of governmental controls  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  terrorism and anti american sentiment  trade restrictions  slowing economic growth and availability of investment capital and credit  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer product acceptance and payment cycles  the greater difficulty in administering business overseas  and inability to enforce payment obligations or recourse to legal protections accorded creditors to the same extent within the us any kind of economic instability in parts of asia where we do business can have a severe negative impact on our operating results  due to the large concentration of our sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian regions  including taiwan and japan  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively affected our revenues and also negatively affected our 
table of contents ability to collect payments from customers 
the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
although we invoice a majority of our international sales in united states dollars  we invoice our sales in japan in japanese yen 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the japanese yen may adversely affect our future results of operations 
we do not currently engage in active currency hedging transactions 
nonetheless  as we expand our international operations  we may allow payment in additional foreign currencies and our exposure to losses due to foreign currency transactions may increase 
moreover  the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
for example  if the united states dollar declined in value relative to a local currency  we could be required to pay more for our expenditures in that market  including salaries  commissions  local operations and marketing expenses  each of which is paid in local currency 
in addition  we may lose customers if exchange rate fluctuations  currency devaluations or economic crises increase the local currency price of our products and manufacturing costs or reduce our customers ability to purchase our products 
asian and european courts might not enforce judgments rendered in the united states 
there is doubt as to the enforceability in asia and europe of judgments obtained in any federal or state court in the united states in civil and commercial matters 
the united states does not currently have a treaty with many asian and european countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of a fixed debt or sum of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states would not automatically be enforceable in many european and asian countries 
our current and planned operations may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 
we may expand our operations through both internal growth and acquisitions 
we expect this expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls 
in addition  we may incur higher operating costs and be required to increase substantially our working capital to fund operations as a result of such an expansion 
in addition  during an expansion  we may incur significantly increased up front costs of sale and product manufacture well in advance of receiving revenue for such product sales 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls 
if we fail to do so  our growth will be limited and our liquidity and ability to fund our operations could be significantly strained 
our officers have limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing businesses 
further  consideration for future acquisitions could be in the form of cash  common stock  rights to purchase stock  or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing shareholders  and to earnings per share  may result if shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase common stock are issued in connection with any future acquisitions 
if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract  train or retain qualified personnel  our business would be harmed 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our key management and other key personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
few of our senior management  key technical personnel or key sales personnel are bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our key personnel 
the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel could harm our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  legal and finance personnel  and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group 
competition for qualified senior employees can be intense 
if we fail to do this  our business could be harmed 
moreover  some of the individuals on our management team have been in their current positions for a relatively short period of time 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our 
table of contents management team to work effectively together 
there can be no assurance that our management team will be able to integrate and work together effectively 
when we account for employee stock options using the fair value method  it will significantly impact our results from operations 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments sbp  fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment fas r  that requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards  including purchases made under an employee stock purchase plan 
under a change approved by the sec in april  the effective date of this requirement for us will be april   the beginning of our next fiscal year that begins after june  fas r applies to all outstanding and unvested sbp awards at adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fas r and have not selected a transition method or valuation model 
as such  we are unable to estimate the expected effect on our financial statements  but believe that it may have a significant adverse impact on our results from operations 
risks related to our industry the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is highly cyclical and is affected by recurring downturns in the semiconductor industry  and these cycles can harm our operating results 
our business largely depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
semiconductor manufacturers are dependent on the then current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these periodic downturns  whether the result of general economic changes or decreases in demand for semiconductors  are difficult to predict and often have a severe adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
sales of equipment to semiconductor manufacturers may be significantly more cyclical than sales of semiconductors  as the large capital expenditures required for building new fabs or facilitating existing fabs is often delayed until semiconductor manufacturers are confident about increases in future demand 
if demand for semiconductor equipment remains depressed for an extended period  it will seriously harm our business 
as a result of substantial cost reductions in response to the decrease in net sales and uncertainty over the timing and extent of any industry recovery  we may be unable to make the investments in marketing  research and development  and engineering that are necessary to maintain our competitive position  which could seriously harm our long term business prospects 
we believe that the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries will continue  leading to periodic industry downturns  which may seriously harm our business and financial position 
we may not effectively compete in a highly competitive semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we currently face direct competition with respect to all of our products 
a number of competitors may have greater name recognition  more extensive engineering  research development  manufacturing  and marketing capabilities  access to lower cost components or manufacturing  and substantially greater financial  technical and personnel resources than those available to us 
brooks automation  inc  or brooks  and tdk corporation of japan are our primary competitors in the area of loadports 
our smart traveler system products face competition from brooks and omron 
we also compete with several companies in the robotics area  including  but not limited to  brooks  rorze corporation and yasukawa super mecatronics division 
in the area of amhs  we face competition primarily from daifuku co  ltd 
and murata co  ltd 
our wafer sorters compete primarily with products from recif  inc and brooks 
we also face competition for our software products from symatics and brooks 
in addition  the 
table of contents industry transition to mm wafers is likely to draw new competitors to the fab automation and amhs markets 
in the mm wafer market  we expect to face intense competition from a number of established automation companies such as brooks  as well as new competition from semiconductor equipment and cleanroom construction companies 
we expect that our competitors will continue to develop new products in direct competition with our systems  improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics  and existing products at lower costs 
to remain competitive  we need to continue to improve and expand our product line  which will require us to maintain a high level of investment in research and development 
ultimately  we may not be able to make the technological advances and investments necessary to remain competitive 
companies in the semiconductor capital equipment industry face continued pressure to reduce costs 
pricing actions by our competitors may require us to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of short term fixed income securities and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by periodically positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities have their fair market value adversely affected by rising interest rates 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  and bps would result in a reduction of percent and percent  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio as of march  we also have the ability to keep our fixed income investments fairly liquid 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for the investment portfolio at march  as a general matter  our intent is not to hold investments longer than twelve months weighted remaining average maturities principal amount interest rate in thousands cash equivalents institutional money market funds within year  commercial paper within year  total cash equivalents short term investments auction rate securities within years  corporate debt securities within years  municipal debt securities within years international debt securities within year  federal agency notes within years  total short term investments 
table of contents the auction rate securities in the tables above have a reset feature  by nature  that the interest rates of these securities are reset at least monthly 
we can buy or sell them at each reset date without any obligation 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we engage in international operations and transact business in various foreign countries 
the primary source of foreign currency cash flows is japan and to a lesser extent china  taiwan  singapore and europe 
although we operate and sell products in various global markets  substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars  except in japan 
to date  the foreign currency transactions and exposure to exchange rate volatility have not been significant 
although we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations  there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange risk will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future 
the following table presents our net loss with an hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the japanese yen by percent and percent  respectively  compared to the average rate used during the fiscal year ended march  in thousands strengthening in weakening in japanese yen of no change in japanese yen of x percent japanese yen x percent exchange rate interest rate net loss for the fiscal year ended march
