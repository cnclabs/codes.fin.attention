item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenues are derived from product sales  which include both licenses of our test system software and sales of our test system hardware  and from services  which include customer support under hardware and software support contracts as well as training 
prices for our test systems vary widely depending upon overall system configuration  including the number and type of software protocol modules and the number of physical interfaces required by the customer 
a system sale typically ranges in price from approximately  to over  in addition to the initial system purchase  customers also may upgrade their systems by purchasing additional software protocol modules and hardware 
product sales are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installation is complete  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we offer product warranties for various lengths of time  depending on the product and the country of purchase or operation 
customers may elect to purchase a software support contract that includes both ongoing technical support and any new software releases on a when and if available basis during the term of the contract 
revenues from software support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is generally one year 
new customers often purchase onsite training  which is charged based on the number of days provided and recognized when completed 
conditions and trends in our industry over the course of our last fiscal year ended september   we saw further evidence of a recovery in the global telecommunications industry from the severe downturn that affected us in fiscal and this improvement in market conditions resulted in increased purchasing of our products and services by our customers in north america  europe and  most notably  all other markets except japan referred to by us as rest of world  where we saw our strongest growth rate 
the growth in rest of world revenues reflected two factors additional business in china generated by the office we established there late in fiscal  and increased off shoring of research and development activity by some of our multinational telecommunications manufacturer customers 
in japan  although market conditions remained healthy  our revenue decreased year over year as we failed to secure a japanese fiscal year end budget surplus order from a major customer 
summary of our financial performance in fiscal our financial performance in the year ended september  once again improved over our performance in the previous year our revenues increased by to million and our operating income increased by to million 
three major factors contributed to this improved financial performance in north america  europe and rest of world  we saw revenue increases of   and respectively due to the continuing improvement in market conditions discussed above 
we saw a further improvement of one percentage point in overall gross profit margin as our services revenues increased by more than the associated cost 

table of contents despite an increase of million or in general and administrative expenses due almost entirely to the first year costs to comply with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  we limited the increase in our operating expenses to  the same level as our revenue growth rate 
the impact of these factors on net income was largely offset by the absence of the tax benefit recorded in fiscal during fiscal  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million  of which million was provided by operating activities and million was provided from the sale of stock under our stock option and employee share purchase 
capital expenditures in fiscal amounted to million 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies below and the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying these policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below and throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected future financial results 
we also have other key accounting policies 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for a discussion on the application of these other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of our product arrangements normally include hardware and software 
certain of our sales may also include installation 
we also offer professional services primarily training and maintenance services separately from our product arrangements 
in connection with each transaction involving these arrangements we examine the customer agreement and or purchase order to determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and there is no basis for considering that the transaction forms a single arrangement with one or more other transactions 
we assess that the fee is fixed or determinable by verifying that it is not subject to an agreement to provide additional products or services at a later date or to renegotiation or contingencies including refund  right of return or third party financing or transactions  and that the payment terms do not extend significantly beyond our customary range 
we assess that collection is probable based on customer credit information and payment history 
subject to the foregoing considerations  we recognize revenue on product sales upon delivery or  if installation services are purchased  when installation is complete 
we recognize revenues allocated to training and other professional services at the time the services are completed 
we recognize revenues allocated to maintenance ratably over the term of the maintenance contract during which the services are delivered 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
if we have vsoe for the undelivered elements only  we allocate value using the residual method  under which we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the vsoe of the undelivered elements and apply any discount to the delivered elements 
vsoe for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations within an arrangement is based upon substantive renewal rates quoted in the contracts or  in the absence of stated renewal rates  upon a history of separate sales of renewals to each customer or class of customers 
vsoe for services such as training or consulting is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers without the bundling of other elements 
the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments in any of these areas involving revenue recognition 
foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  and we infrequently use currency options  to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter 
table of contents company receivables or expected revenues 
the forward contracts and options are not designated as accounting hedges 
we attempt to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables in terms of currency  amount and maturity  and to match the options with expected foreign currency revenue in terms of currency  amount and recognition period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
gains or losses on forward contracts and options as well as the cost of the options are included in other income expense  net 
to the extent that our judgment in mitigating the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates is imperfect  we may incur foreign exchange losses that could affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence reserve when judging the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
bad debt expenses recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
our accounts receivable balance as of september  was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve to write down excess and obsolete inventories to its estimated net realizable value 
in recording this reserve  we make significant estimates and assumptions based on our judgment of inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of future demand 
a significant decrease in market demand for our product could result in an increase in our reserve for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change that could result in an increase in the amount of our reserve for obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
when we record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we create a new cost basis for the inventory 
recoveries of previously written down inventory are recognized only when the related inventory has been sold and revenue has been recognized 
our inventory balance as of september  was million  net of a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
the majority of this reserve was recorded against inventory acquired with ndb as part of our acquisition accounting 
the amount and timing of cost of goods sold recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  the change is included as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based on our recurring history of generating income and our estimates concerning future results of operation  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for net operating losses or for foreign tax credits 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net federal and state operating loss carry forwards totaled million and million  respectively  at september  net foreign tax credits amounted to million at september  in addition  the estimation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in all the jurisdictions in which we do business 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of the possibility that additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of additional amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the associated liabilities and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which this determination is made 
if we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be  we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which this determination is made 

table of contents goodwill and long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
we performed our most recent annual impairment test on september  and determined that we have a single reporting unit 
we did not record a loss on impairment of goodwill during the fiscal years ended september   and we will continue to perform this test annually 
in assessing potential impairment  we make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the discounted future cash flows of our reporting unit to determine its fair value 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  projected future operating results  working capital ratios  cash flow  terminal values  market discount rates and tax rates 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
goodwill was million at september  and sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate a review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable or that the useful life of a long lived asset may be shortened 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of and that we have committed to a plan to dispose of  whether through sale or abandonment  are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
during the years ended september   and  we did not record any impairment charges on long lived assets or certain intangible assets 
in assessing potential impairment  we make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of intangible assets and the discounted future cash flows that these assets are expected to generate to determine their fair value 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on long lived assets and certain intangible assets to reduce the carrying amount of these assets 
net intangible assets and long lived assets were million and million at september  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from our consolidated statements of income to total revenues 
percentage of total revenues year ended september  revenues products services total revenues cost of revenues products services amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income gross profit margin on products gross profit margin on services gross profit margin on products and services excludes amortization of purchased technology 

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the continuing recovery in the global telecommunications market discussed above under the heading conditions and trends in our industry and to a increase in the value of the japanese yen  in which all our revenues in japan are denominated 
services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in the number of systems under maintenance 
by geographic region  north american revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  european revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  japanese revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and rest of world revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of revenues cost of product revenues excluding amortization of purchased technology increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product revenues excluding amortization of purchased technology remained unchanged at as higher hardware component costs were offset by a more favorable product mix and economies of scale in our manufacturing operation 
cost of services revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as the impact of an increase of  or employees  in the average number of customer support personnel was more than offset by two factors a million decrease in variable compensation as a result of less favorable performance against target  and the absence in the latter year of a one time million provision recorded in fiscal for the replacement of certain product under maintenance contract 
gross margin on services revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues decreased for the reasons discussed above  while the associated revenues increased 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
amortization of purchased technology in fiscal remained unchanged from the million expensed in fiscal cost of revenues expressed as a percentage of revenues did not vary significantly by geographic region 
research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase reflected primarily three factors an increase of  or employees  in the average number of research and development personnel  an exchange rate driven increase of million due to average increases of in the australian dollar and in the british pound against the us dollar  and a partially offsetting decrease of million in variable compensation as a result of less favorable performance against target 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal we expect the absolute annual level of research and 
table of contents development expenses to remain relatively unchanged in fiscal as the costs related to any increase in the number of employees in this area are expected to be offset by a reduction in depreciation expense related to assets acquired in with ndb that are now fully depreciated 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of four factors an increase of  or employees  in the number of sales and marketing personnel  an exchange rate driven increase of million due to average increases of in the british pound  in the euro and in the japanese yen against the us dollar  an increase of million in recruiting costs  and a partially offsetting decrease of million in variable compensation as a result of less favorable performance against target 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal we expect the absolute annual level of sales and marketing expenses to increase by approximately in fiscal primarily as a result of an anticipated increase in the number of employees in this area 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a million increase in accounting costs due to increased sarbanes oxley compliance and audit costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from to over the same period 
we expect the absolute annual level of general and administrative expenses to remain relatively unchanged in fiscal as the costs related to any increase in the number of employees in this area are expected to be offset by a reduction in sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
interest income interest income increased from million in fiscal to million fiscal due to higher prevailing rates of return and higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
realized gains and losses on sale of securities are included in interest income 
interest expense no interest expense was recorded in fiscal interest expense of million was recorded in fiscal on the convertible notes payable that were converted into common stock in september other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased from income of million in fiscal to an expense of million in fiscal as million in foreign exchange losses were recorded in fiscal in comparison with foreign exchange gains of less than million in fiscal income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal this provision was net of million in tax benefits related to several items  including additional research and development tax benefits resulting both from the retroactive reintroduction of the related tax credit program and from a claim for additional benefits filed as a result of the irs audit completed at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction of approximately million in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year 
this reduction was made as a result of a determination that additional taxes for which we had previously recognized liabilities would not be due 
as a result  our effective tax rate changed from a benefit of in fiscal to a provision of in fiscal in the absence of the benefits noted above  we would have recorded a tax provision of in fiscal we expect our future tax rate will vary depending in part on the relative pre tax income contribution from our domestic and foreign operations 
future additional expense for stock based compensation the financial accounting standards board fasb has concluded that statement r  share based payment  which will require all companies to measure compensation expense for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  will be effective for public companies for annual periods 
table of contents beginning after june  adoption of fasb statement r will require us to record an expense for stock based compensation plans and will result in ongoing accounting charges that will significantly reduce our net income 
see the section entitled stock based compensation in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to overseas market recovery that resulted in increased shipments of our test products and to a increase in the value of the japanese yen  in which all our revenues in japan are denominated 
services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in the number of systems under maintenance 
by geographic region  north american revenues in fiscal remained unchanged from fiscal at million  european revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  japanese revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and rest of world revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of revenues cost of product revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal both the decrease in cost of product revenues and the increase in gross margin on product revenues reflected primarily two factors first  our product mix was weighted more heavily to higher margin product  and secondly  our manufacturing overhead costs decreased by or million in the absence of the transitional acquisition related manufacturing costs we incurred in fiscal cost of services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to a million increase in variable compensation related to above target performance and to a provision of million for the replacement of certain product under maintenance contract 
gross margin on services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues  consisting primarily of compensation costs  grew slightly more than the associated revenues 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
amortization of purchased technology in fiscal remained unchanged from the million expensed in fiscal cost of revenues expressed as a percentage of revenues did not vary significantly by geographic region 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease reflected primarily four factors a decrease of approximately million due to a reduction of  or employees  in the number of research and development personnel largely as a result of the staff reduction undertaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increases totaling million in variable compensation related to above target performance  increases of million in new product development and testing costs  and an exchange rate driven increase of million due to average increases of in the australian dollar and in the british pound against the us dollar

as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a million increase in variable compensation related to above target performance  a million decrease in facilities costs in the absence of transitional costs related to the ndb acquisition and a million increase in legal and accounting costs due to increased regulatory compliance costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to over the same period 
restructuring costs no restructuring charge was recorded in fiscal a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to costs associated with the involuntary termination of employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in the customer service component of services cost of goods and in the manufacturing component of product cost of goods 
the terminations represented of our pre termination workforce 
interest income interest income remained unchanged at million in fiscal in comparison with fiscal as the effect of higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances was offset by lower prevailing rates of return 
realized gains and losses on sale of securities are included in interest income 
interest expense interest expense on the convertible notes payable decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a decrease in interest accrued on the convertible notes payable resulting from these notes being outstanding for a shorter period of time in fiscal than in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased from income of million in fiscal to income of million in fiscal due principally to a reduction of million in foreign exchange gains and the absence in fiscal of a japanese consumption tax refund in the amount of approximately million received in fiscal income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction of approximately million in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year as a result of a favorable outcome of an irs tax audit 
in fiscal  we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million as a result of three factors transfer pricing and other adjustments of approximately million  a reduction of approximately million in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year as a result of the likely favorable outcome of a tax audit of our japanese subsidiary  and the recognition of approximately million in future tax benefits of foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes paid on the liquidation proceeds of the japanese subsidiary acquired from tekelec 
as a result  our effective tax rate changed from a benefit of in fiscal to a benefit of in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through cash generated from operations  from the proceeds of our initial public offering completed in early and from the proceeds of a second public offering completed in september the proceeds to us from the and offerings  net of underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million and million  respectively 
our purchase of ndb in was additionally financed through the issuance of two convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible notes were issued by our irish subsidiary and were guaranteed by us 
these notes were converted by tekelec into  shares of our common stock in september 
table of contents our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in each of these years  net income was the primary component of cash flows from operating activities  providing million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash generated by net income was increased by adjustments for non cash charges totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these non cash charges include charges for additional depreciation and amortization related to our acquisition of ndb 
the additional acquisition related non cash depreciation charges ended in fiscal and the majority of the acquisition related non cash amortization charges will end in fiscal finally  our cash flows from operations are affected by changes in current assets and liabilities  net of the effects of the acquisition 
these changes in non cash working capital components decreased cash flow from operations by million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
we calculate our days outstanding by dividing our accounts receivable balance net of allowances at the end of a period by the revenues for that period and multiplying the result by the number of days in the period 
our days outstanding improved from days for the year ended september  to days for the year ended september  due primarily to the increased intra quarter invoicing linearity that resulted from an improvement in business conditions over the year then ended 
our days outstanding deteriorated from days for the year ended september  to days for the year ended september  due primarily to a decrease in intra quarter invoicing linearity that resulted from purchasing by our customers later in the quarter 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms extended to our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
investing activities have consisted of three components the acquisition of ndb  purchases of property and equipment  and purchases and sales of short term investments 
our acquisition of ndb used cash of million in fiscal purchases of property and equipment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately million in fiscal we invest cash that is surplus to our operating requirements in our short term investment portfolio 
purchases and sales of short term investments provided net cash of million in fiscal to assist with the final ndb acquisition payment and used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as surplus cash that we generated was invested 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal as we repurchased a higher value of common stock than the value that we issued 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the sale of shares in a public offering  the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of september   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
as of september   we had the following payment obligations in the listed categories of contractual obligations payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in millions operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our liquidity or cash requirements 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funds generated from operations will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets 
in fiscal  approximately of our invoices were issued and paid in japanese yen and were issued in other foreign currencies 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  and we infrequently use options  to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables or expected revenues 
the forward contracts and options are not designated as accounting hedges 
we attempt to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables in terms of currency  amount and maturity  and to match the options with expected foreign currency revenue in terms of currency  amount and recognition period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts and options generally offsets the related impact on the exposures economically hedged  these derivative financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts generally offset the foreign exchange transaction gains or losses from revaluation of foreign currency denominated amounts receivable 
gains on options generally offset the reduction in income resulting from revenues recognized at an exchange rate less favorable than the option rate 
to date  we have not fully mitigated all risk associated with our revenues and resulting accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  and there can be no assurance that our future mitigation activities  if any  will be successful 
at september   we had forward exchange contracts maturing in fiscal to sell approximately million in japanese yen 
these contracts were designed to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates relating to inter company accounts receivable 
there were no options outstanding at that date 
the fair market value of these contracts at september  was not material 
we also incur operating expenses in foreign currencies including the japanese yen  the british pound  the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the swedish krona and the chinese renminbi 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses in foreign currencies 
in japan  our yen operating expenses  which amounted to approximately million in fiscal  are lower than our yen revenues and act as a partial natural hedge on our exposure on those revenues 
our operating expenses in other foreign currencies exceed our revenues in those currencies and thus represent an exchange rate exposure 
we do not attempt to mitigate this operating expense exchange rate exposure through the use of derivatives 
we have evaluated the potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term currency fluctuations  and we believe that any such losses would not be material 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
as of september   short term investments consisted of available for sale securities of million see note  balance sheet components in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these fixed income marketable securities included corporate and municipal bonds and government securities  all of which are of high investment grade 
they are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if the market interest rates increase 
if the market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position
