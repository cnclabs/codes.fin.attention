item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein 
overview perot systems corporation is a worldwide provider of information technology commonly referred to as it services and business solutions to a broad range of customers 
we offer our customers integrated solutions designed around their specific business objectives  chosen from a breadth of services  including technology infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
with this approach  our customers benefit from integrated service offerings that help synchronize their strategy  systems  and infrastructure 
as a result  we help our customers achieve their business objectives  whether those objectives are to accelerate growth  streamline operations  or enhance customer service capabilities 
our services our customers may contract with us for any one or more of the following categories of services infrastructure services applications services business process services consulting services infrastructure services infrastructure services are typically performed under multi year contracts in which we assume operational responsibility for various aspects of our customers businesses  including data center management  web hosting and internet access  desktop solutions  messaging services  network management  program management  and security 
we typically hire a significant portion of the customer s staff that have supported these functions 
we then apply our expertise and operating methodologies to increase the efficiency of the operations  which usually results in increased operational quality at a lower cost 
applications services applications services include services such as application development and maintenance  including the development and maintenance of custom and packaged application software for customers  and application systems migration and testing  which includes the migration of applications from legacy environments to current technologies  as well as performing quality assurance functions on custom applications 
we offer these services typically on a short term basis 
business process services business process services include services such as claims processing  call center management  energy management  payment and settlement management  security  and services to improve the collection of receivables 
in addition  business process services include engineering support and other technical services 
consulting services consulting services include strategy consulting  enterprise consulting  technology consulting  and research 
the consulting services provided to customers within our industry solutions segment typically consist of customized  industry specific business solutions provided by associates with industry expertise  as well as the implementation of prepackaged software applications 
consulting services are typically viewed as 
table of contents discretionary services by our customers  with the level of business activity depending on many factors  including economic conditions and specific customer needs 
our contracts our contracts include services priced using a wide variety of pricing mechanisms 
in determining how to price our services  we consider the delivery  credit and pricing risk of a business relationship 
for the year ended december  approximately of our revenue was from fixed price contracts where our customers pay us a set amount for contracted services 
for some of these fixed price contracts  the price will be set so that the customer realizes an immediate savings in relation to their current expense for an operation we are assuming 
on contracts of this nature  our profitability generally increases over the term of the contract as we become more efficient 
the time that it takes for us to realize these efficiencies can range from a few months to a few years  depending on the complexity of the operation 
approximately of our revenue was from cost plus contracts where our billings are based in part on the amount of expense we incur in providing services to a customer 
approximately of our revenue was from time and materials contracts where our billings are based on measurements such as hours  days or months and an agreed upon rate 
in some cases  the rate the customer pays for a unit of time can vary over the term of a contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
approximately of our revenue was from per unit pricing where we bill our customers based on the volume of units provided at the unit rate specified 
in some contracts  the per unit prices may vary over the term of the contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
we also utilize other pricing mechanisms  including license fees and risk reward relationships where we participate in the benefit associated with delivering a certain outcome 
revenue from these other pricing mechanisms totaled of our revenue 
depending on a customer s business requirements and the pricing structure of the contract  the amount of cash generated from a contract can vary significantly during a contract s term 
with fixed price contracts or when an upfront payment is required to purchase assets  an infrastructure services contract will typically produce less cash at the beginning of the contract with significantly more cash being generated as efficiencies are realized later in the term 
with a cost plus contract  the amount of cash generated tends to be relatively consistent over the term of the contract 
our lines of business we offer our services under three primary lines of business industry solutions  government services  and technology services 
we consider these three lines of business to be reportable segments and include financial information and disclosures about these reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements 
you can find this financial information in note  segment and certain geographic data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements below 
we routinely evaluate the historical performance of and growth prospects for various areas of our business  including our lines of business  vertical industry groups  and service offerings 
based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of varying factors  we may increase or decrease the amount of ongoing investment in each of these business areas  make acquisitions that strengthen our market position  or divest  exit  or downsize aspects of a business area 
during the past five years  we have used our acquisition program to strengthen our business in the healthcare market  consulting markets  and to expand into the government market 
at the same time  we have divested  or exited  certain service offerings and joint ventures that did not meet our criteria for continued investment 

table of contents results of operations overview of our financial results for our financial results are affected by a number of factors  including broad economic conditions  the amount and type of technology spending by our customers  and the business strategies and financial condition of our customers and the industries we serve  which could result in increases or decreases in the amount of services that we provide to our customers and the pricing of such services 
our ability to identify and effectively respond to these factors is important to our future financial growth 
we evaluate our consolidated performance on the basis of several performance indicators 
the four key performance indicators we use are revenue growth  earnings growth  free cash flow  and the value of contracts signed 
we compare these key performance indicators to both annual target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
we establish the targets for these key performance indicators primarily on an annual basis  but we may revise them during the year 
we assess our performance using these key indicators on a quarterly and annual basis 
below is a summary of our financial results for as compared to year ended december change in millions  except per share data revenue direct cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated affiliates other income expense  net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles diluted earnings per common share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles weighted average diluted shares outstanding percentage change is not meaningful 
revenue growth revenue growth is a measure of the growth we generate through sales of services to new customers  retention of existing contracts  acquisitions  and discretionary services from existing customers 
revenue for grew by as compared to as discussed in more detail below  this revenue growth came primarily from the following revenue from companies acquired during revenue from new contracts signed during and an increase in discretionary technology investments by our customers  which we believe is due to improved economic conditions 

table of contents earnings growth we measure earnings growth using diluted earnings per share  which is a measure of our effectiveness in delivering profitable growth 
diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for increased to per share from per share for as discussed in more detail below  this increase came primarily from an overall net increase in profitability for existing commercial customer contracts  which is primarily due to an increase in the amount of services we perform that are in addition to our base level of services 
these increased services are discretionary in nature  and the associated margins are typically higher than those we realize on our base level of services 
income from our technology services line of business 
as discussed in greater detail in exiting of a customer contract  we recorded additional expenses in associated with the exiting of a contract in the second quarter of an effective tax rate for the year ended december  of as compared to an effective tax rate for income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december  of partially offsetting these increases in earnings was an increase in expense in for bonuses to associates 
we continue to see prospective customers desiring fixed and per unit pricing mechanisms for the billing of our outsourcing services 
while these pricing mechanisms typically impact the initial profit margins on new contracts  they do not necessarily affect the overall expected profitability of new contracts 
free cash flow we calculate free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  equipment and purchased software  as stated in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we use free cash flow as a measure of our ability to generate cash for both our short term and long term operating and business expansion needs 
we use a twelve month period to measure our success in this area because of the significant variations that typically occur on a quarterly basis due to the timing of certain cash payments 
free cash flow for the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  free cash flow  which is a non gaap measure  can be reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as follows in millions twelve months ended december net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow free cash flow for increased as compared to due primarily to the same reasons discussed above for our increase in earnings 
tcv of contracts signed the amount of total contract value commonly referred to as tcv that we sell during a certain twelve month period is a measure of our success in capturing new business in the various outsourcing and consulting markets in which we provide services 
we measure tcv as our estimate of the total expected revenue from new contracts with new customers where the contract is expected to generate revenue in excess of a defined amount during its contract term and the contract term exceeds a defined length of time 
if a new 
table of contents contract does not meet the defined amount of revenue or length of term  it is not included in our tcv calculation 
various factors may impact the timing of when a contract is signed  including the complexity of the contract  competitive pressures  and customer demands 
as a result  we typically use a twelve month period to measure our success in this area because of the significant variations that typically occur in the amount of tcv signed during each quarterly period 
during the twelve month period ending december   the amount of tcv signed was billion  as compared to billion for the twelve month period ending december  additional measurements our three major lines of business are industry solutions  government services  and technology services 
each of these three major lines of business has distinct economic factors  business trends  and risks that could affect our results of operations 
as a result  in addition to the four metrics discussed above that we use to measure our consolidated financial performance  we use similar metrics for each of these lines of business and for certain industry groups and operating units within these lines of business 
acquisition of perot systems tsi bv as discussed in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  on december   we acquired hcl technologies shares in hcl perot systems bv  and changed the name of hps to perot systems tsi bv  which now operates as our technology services line of business 
because of the late december closing of this acquisition  the post acquisition results of operations of tsi were not material to our consolidated results of operations for as a result  we continued to account for tsi s results of operations using the equity method of accounting through december   and the balance of our investment in tsi at december   was million 
we consolidated the assets and liabilities of tsi as of december  changes in accounting principles change in accounting principle for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below in critical accounting policies under the heading revenue recognition  we changed our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables for both existing and prospective customers 
our adoption of eitf  which was effective january   resulted in an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
this adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenues associated with our long term fixed price contracts that include construction services  as each such contract had been accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
change in accounting principle upon adoption of fin effective december   we adopted the consolidation requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  which changes the criteria for consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  fin may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 

table of contents in june  we entered into an operating lease contract with a variable interest entity for the use of land and office buildings in plano  texas  including a data center facility 
as part of our adoption of fin  we consolidated this entity beginning on december   which resulted in an increase in assets and long term debt of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or 
per share diluted  representing primarily the cumulative depreciation expense on the office buildings and data center facility through december  exiting of a customer contract in  we entered into a long term fixed price it outsourcing contract with a customer that included various non construction services and a construction service  which was an application development project 
in  we began to expect that the actual cost to complete the application development project would exceed the cost estimate included in the contract with the customer 
the contract provided for us to collect most of the excess of the actual cost over the cost estimate in the contract  but we expected the project to generate a loss because we did not expect to collect all of the excess 
however  we did not recognize a loss on the contract at that time 
as discussed below under revenue recognition in our critical accounting policies discussion  prior to the adoption of eitf we recorded revenue and profit on our fixed price contracts that included both construction and non construction services using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
therefore  because we expected that the contract would be profitable in the aggregate over its term  we did not recognize a loss on this contract in as part of our adoption of eitf in the first quarter of  we were required to separate the deliverables in the contract into multiple units of accounting 
as a result  we recognized a net estimated loss on the application development project totaling approximately million approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  which was recorded as part of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the million loss on the application development project is composed of two adjustments the reversal of million of revenue and profit that was recognized prior to january   to adjust our cumulative revenue from this contract to the amount that would have been recorded if we had applied the percentage of completion method only to the application development unit of accounting 
the recording of a future estimated loss of million as of january   which was calculated as the difference between the estimated amount that we expected to collect from the customer and the estimated costs to complete the application development project 
if eitf had been in effect during  the million net estimated loss on the application development project would have had the following net impact on revenue  direct cost of services  and gross profit for the year ended december  in millions december  revenue direct cost of services gross profit in the second quarter of  we were unable to reach agreement with the customer on the timing and form of payment for the excess 
as a result  we exited this contract and recorded an additional million of expense in direct cost of services in the second quarter of  which consisted of the following the impairment of assets related to this contract totaling million  including the impairment of million of long term accrued revenue 
the accrual of estimated costs to exit this contract of million 

table of contents partially offsetting the above expenses was the reversal of million in accrued liabilities that had been recognized for future losses that we expected to incur to complete the application development project 
we completed the services necessary to transition certain functions back to the customer during the fourth quarter of we have filed a claim in arbitration to recover amounts we believe are due under this contract  and the other party filed counterclaims 
therefore  the amount of actual loss with respect to exiting this contract may vary from our current estimates 
comparison of to revenue revenue for increased by million  or  to  million from revenue of  million for due to increases in revenue from the industry solutions  government services  and technology services segments 
revenue from the industry solutions segment increased million  or  to  million in from  million in this net increase was primarily attributable to million increase from contracts signed during for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in this revenue includes million and million from contracts signed in in the healthcare and commercial solutions groups  respectively 
the services that we are providing to these customers are primarily the same services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
million increase from contracts signed during this revenue includes million and million from new contracts signed in the healthcare and commercial solutions groups  respectively 
the services that we are providing to these new customers are primarily the same services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
the strength in healthcare new sales revenue comes from two primary factors our solutions for the healthcare market were developed over several years and are highly customized to the specific business needs of the market 
we identified certain aspects of the healthcare market as core to our long term service offerings several years ago when the market for technology and business process outsourcing was immature 
as a result  we have an established presence and brand  which we have strengthened during the past several years through internal investment in software and solutions and through acquisitions 
the healthcare industry today is in a state of change as health systems look to transform their clinical and administrative back office operations  payer organizations work to develop new consumer based health models  and as the rate of medical cost inflation continues to be high 
these business factors  as well as increased outsourcing activity within the markets we serve  have resulted in stronger new sales revenue 
the markets that we serve through our commercial solutions group have less scale  and we have been operating in these markets during a time when many of these industries have been experiencing economic pressures coupled with a mature market for technology outsourcing 
consequently  we have not experienced the same level of demand in these markets as we have in the healthcare industry 
million net increase from existing accounts  short term offerings  and project work 
this net increase results from expanding our base services to existing long term customers and from providing additional discretionary services to these customers 
the discretionary services that we provide  which include short term offerings and project work  can vary from period to period depending on many factors  including specific customer and industry needs and economic conditions 
the majority of this increase is related to contracts in the healthcare industry 
the state of change in the healthcare industry has required increased system investment  which creates demand for our services 
because of 
table of contents the increased complexity associated with system changes and combined with a desire to focus on core functions  the healthcare outsourcing market has experienced increased levels of business 
we have also experienced increases in the markets served by our commercial solutions group 
within the manufacturing market and the construction and engineering market  we have experienced increased levels of business primarily as a result of customers continuing needs to reduce expense and to improve the efficiency of their operations 
million increase from technology and business consulting services and business process services  primarily due to an increase in business volume 
both business volume and pricing directly impact our revenue and are indicators of the value we bring to customers  as well as the competitive environment for our services 
therefore  because our direct costs are relatively fixed from period to period  changes in utilization and billing rates can affect our profitability 
for  utilization increased while the average billing rate remained flat 
the increase in utilization came primarily as a result of an increase in discretionary spending by our customers  which we believe is due to an overall improvement in economic conditions 
our services are typically viewed as discretionary services by our customers and tend to be tied to their level of systems investment  which varies with the rate of technology change and general economic conditions 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in revenue associated with three customer contract changes 
as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  we exited an under performing contract during the second quarter of  resulting in a million decrease in revenue in as compared to additionally  we completed two contract renewals that resulted in a revenue reduction of million for as compared to  primarily relating to reductions in price 
although both of these contract renewals included price reductions  the circumstances for these reductions differ for the two contract renewals 
for one of these renewals  we were realizing higher than normal profit margins primarily because our contract pricing included the recovery of a significant investment that was made at the beginning of the contract 
when the customer was acquired by another company  we signed a new long term services agreement with a reduced scope of services  less up front investment  and a corresponding reduction in price 
for the second renewal  the customer agreed to enter into a long term arrangement for services that we were performing on a short term basis 
the long term commitment reduced our risk on the contract  and therefore we reduced the price 
revenue from the government services segment increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase is primarily attributable to new contracts and existing program expansion with the department of homeland security  the department of defense  and civilian agencies of the federal government 
for the contracts underlying this revenue increase  we are providing program management  administrative  professional  and engineering services related to both a recently awarded program by the department of homeland security and from existing programs where specific initiatives of the government required additional resources for as compared to our business with the federal government may fluctuate due to annual federal funding limits and the specific needs of the federal agencies we serve 
the remaining year to year increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of soza company  ltd 
in february as we recognized approximately million of additional revenue in resulting from a full year of revenue in our financial statements 
as discussed in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  in late december we acquired perot systems tsi bv we continued to account for tsi s results of operations using the equity method of accounting through december  revenue from this segment was million for  net of the elimination of intersegment revenue of million 

table of contents revenue from ubs  our largest customer  was million for  or of revenue 
this revenue is reported within the industry solutions and technology services lines of business and is summarized in the following table amounts in millions twelve months ended december change ubs revenue in industry solutions ubs revenue in technology services total revenue from ubs percentage change is not meaningful 
the increase in revenue from ubs is due primarily to the acquisition of tsi  as discussed above  which is included in the technology services line of business 
domestic revenue grew by in to  million from  million in this increase is primarily the result of revenue growth within the industry solutions and government services segments 
domestic revenue growth for our industry solutions segment came primarily from the healthcare industry  where we experienced a strong demand as described above 
in addition  domestic revenue growth for our government services segment came primarily from new contracts and existing program expansion with the department of homeland security  the department of defense  and civilian agencies of the federal government as well as from approximately million of additional revenue related to the acquisition of soza company  ltd 
in february for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in non domestic revenue  consisting of european and asian operations  increased by in to million from million in asian operations generated revenue of million in compared to million in  and this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of tsi 
the largest components of our european operations are in the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for increased to million from million 
in switzerland  revenue for increased to million from million for both of these increases in revenue were due primarily to the acquisition of tsi 
gross margin gross margin  which is calculated as gross profit divided by revenue  for was of revenue  which is higher than the gross margin for of 
this year to year increase in gross margin is primarily due to the following an overall net increase in profitability for existing commercial customer contracts  which is primarily due to an increase in the amount of services we perform that are in addition to our base level of services 
the increased services are discretionary in nature  and the associated gross margins are typically higher than those we realize on our base level of services 
as discussed above  we have seen increased demand for discretionary investment from several customers  primarily in the healthcare industry 
as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  in the second quarter of  we recorded million of expense in direct costs of services associated with the exiting of this contract 
in december  we acquired tsi  which increased our gross margin for tsi typically realizes higher gross margins than what we normally realize on traditional it outsourcing contracts because of the nature of the services they provide  which are primarily offshore application development and management services and business process services 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in direct costs of services of million for associate bonus expense  which includes an increase in associate bonus expense of approximately million that is reimbursable by our customers 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in sg a for was of revenue  which is higher than sg a for of of revenue 
this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of tsi  which added million of sg a expense 
included in sg a for technology services is million related to amortization of intangibles  which is expected to decline in to approximately million 
sg a also increased due to an increase in associate bonus expense of million and an increase of million in expenses associated with corporate compliance and business insurance 
during  we recorded a reduction of sg a expense of million resulting from revising our estimate of liabilities associated with actions in prior years to streamline our operations  which included a favorable resolution of an employment dispute 
other income statement items interest expense for increased by million as compared to this increase is primarily related to the debt we recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   upon adoption of fin during  we recorded a million equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates  which primarily represents our equity in the net loss of tsi formerly known as hps 
tsi s net loss in was due primarily to the recording of stock option compensation expense  which resulted from the modifications of various stock options and negatively impacted our equity in tsi s earnings by approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
our effective tax rate for income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december  was 
the tax rate for was lower than the rate for due to the impact of our foreign operations  including technology services  which has tax holidays in certain asian jurisdictions exempting specific types of income from taxation  a decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million  and a reduction in income tax expense of million relating to the resolution of various outstanding tax issues from prior years 
comparison of to revenue revenue for increased by million  or  to  million from revenue of  million for as noted above  we adopted eitf effective january   which adjusted revenue recognized on existing contracts based on the new criteria of eitf regarding whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
to illustrate the impact of the adoption of eitf on our financial results for  we have shown in the table below the pro forma revenue  gross profit  gross margin  and net income as if eitf had been applied during the year ended december  amounts in millions year ended december  impact from pro forma reported eitf amounts revenue gross profit gross margin net income the impact of eitf on the year ended december   as reflected above  applied only to domestic contracts within the industry solutions segment 

table of contents revenue for increased by million  or  compared to pro forma revenue of  million 
this increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in revenue from the government services segment  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the industry solutions segment 
revenue from the industry solutions segment decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in and decreased million  or  from pro forma revenue of  million in this net decrease as compared to pro forma revenue for was primarily attributable to the following items million decrease in revenue as a result of exiting certain business relationships and under performing delivery units during  primarily in the markets served by the commercial solutions group 
of this decrease in revenue  million related to fees we received in in connection with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures 
one of these joint ventures was with a european telecommunications company and the other was with a european financial institution 
both of these joint ventures were terminated at the convenience of the customers  resulting in the payments to us of million in termination fees 
the remaining revenue decrease is due primarily to reduced revenue from those two joint ventures as they were terminated in million decrease from ubs to million in from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to cost savings efforts initiated by us and ubs 
the outsourcing agreement with ubs that covers the majority of our business with ubs  prior to the amendment in discussed above  entitled us to recover our costs plus a fixed fee  with a bonus or penalty that could cause this annual fee to vary up and down by as much as  depending on our level of performance as determined by ubs 
we also provide additional project services to ubs 
as a result  the revenue and gross profit that we derive from our ubs relationship depends on our performance and on the level of services we provide to ubs 
million decrease from technology and business consulting services  due to a combination of business volume and pricing reductions 
both of these measures directly impact our revenue and are indicators of the value we bring to customers  as well as the competitive environment for our services 
in addition  since our direct costs are relatively fixed from period to period  changes in utilization and billing rates can affect our profitability 
for  utilization decreased by  while the average billing rate declined by 
the reduction to utilization came primarily as a result of reduced activity and resulting variation in demand within the consulting markets we serve 
our services tend to be tied to the level of systems investment  which varies with the rate of technology change and general economic conditions 
during the past few years  weakened economic conditions have resulted in inconsistent demand for technology investment 
million net decrease from existing accounts  short term offerings  and project work that is provided to customers within our long term account base 
within our long term customer contracts we typically perform services above our base level of services 
given the discretionary nature of these additional services  the amount of these services that we provide to our customers may fluctuate from period to period depending on many factors  including economic conditions and specific customer needs 
million increase in revenue from contracts signed during the services that we are providing to these new customers are primarily the same services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
these services include both business process services  such as claims processing  and technology related services  such as it infrastructure management  application development and maintenance  and business process re engineering 
for a few of these new customers  we are also providing proprietary software application services  including the implementation and customization of our peradigm health benefits administration suite of software 
these new customer contracts were won primarily in competitive situations with the majority of this revenue growth coming from new contracts with customers in the healthcare industry 
revenue from the government services segment increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of soza 
table of contents company  ltd 
in february  which contributed million of revenue in the remainder of the increase is attributable to adi technology corporation  which we acquired in july adi contributed million of additional revenue in  as we recognized a full year of adi revenue in our financial statements  and million of existing program expansion within the department of homeland security  the department of defense  and the civilian agencies of the federal government 
domestic revenue grew by in to  million from  million in  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from in the prior year 
domestic revenue grew by in from pro forma domestic revenue of  million  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from of total pro forma revenue 
this increase is primarily the result of domestic growth within the industry solutions segment and from our government services segment 
domestic revenue growth for our industry solutions segment came primarily from the healthcare industry  where we experienced a strong demand as described above 
in addition  as discussed above we have acquired two companies in the government services market since july  which has significantly increased our domestic revenue 
non domestic revenue  consisting of european and asian operations  decreased by in to million from million in and decreased to of total revenue from of total revenue and of pro forma revenue 
the largest components of our european operations are in the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for decreased to million from million for in switzerland  revenue for decreased to million from million for asian operations generated revenue of million in compared to million in the majority of the revenue decrease from in our european operations is due to a revenue decline from ubs and a decrease of million in revenue from the two joint ventures that were terminated in in addition  our service offerings for the european market are largely based on providing systems integration and application management services  which are typically tied to economic conditions 
in the few years prior to and including  we experienced a weak demand for technology investment in the various european countries in which we operated  primarily because of the general economic condition in europe  which resulted in revenue declines outside of the united states in and gross margin gross margin for was of revenue  which is lower than the gross margin for of and the pro forma gross margin for of 
the following items are important in understanding the decrease in gross margin as compared to the pro forma gross margin for in  we recorded revenue of million and direct cost of services of million  resulting in gross profit of million  associated with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures 
in  we received a million payment from a customer in bankruptcy reorganization that was previously believed to be unrecoverable 
as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  the pro forma gross profit for includes a reduction of million associated with the adoption of eitf for a contract we exited million as a reduction of revenue and million as an increase in direct cost of services 
as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  in the second quarter of  we recorded million of expense in direct cost of services associated with the exiting of this contract 
in  we recorded additional associate bonus expense of million  which includes an increase in associate bonus expense of approximately million that is reimbursable by our customers 
as discussed below in purchase commitments  in we recorded million of expense associated with unfulfilled minimum purchase commitments 
in  we also experienced a year over year decline in gross margin primarily due to lower up front profitability on new contracts signed during and lower profitability from short term consulting activities  which were partially offset by higher margins from acquisitions and improvements in 
table of contents long term commercial account profitability  including an increase in profitability for certain fixed price contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million from million in sg a for was of revenue  which is lower than sg a for of of pro forma revenue 
in our analysis of sg a for both and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change during  we recorded million of expense in sg a relating to severance and other costs to exit certain activities and million of expense associated with our response to investigations of the california energy crisis 
during  we recorded a reduction of expense of million resulting from revising our estimate of liabilities associated with actions in prior years to streamline our operations  which included a favorable resolution of an employment dispute 
other income statement items interest income decreased by to million in from million in due to a decrease in the average cash balance in as compared to and an overall decrease in interest rates 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated affiliates  which primarily represents our share of the earnings of hcl perot systems bv hps  an information technology services joint venture based in india  was a loss of million in as compared to earnings of million in this change from is primarily related to the following in  our equity in the earnings of hps was negatively impacted by approximately million  which related primarily to stock option compensation expense 
in  the ownership structure of the hps joint venture was modified in connection with the negotiations between us and hcl technologies regarding our potential purchase of hcl s equity ownership in hps or the potential sale to hcl of our equity ownership of hps  as it was agreed that various stock option agreements to purchase shares of hps stock would be modified to provide for the option holders to be paid in cash the intrinsic value of the options on the transaction date 
these options did not contain such a provision prior to the transaction date 
in  hps recorded expense to impair the goodwill related to an acquisition  which reduced our equity in earnings by approximately million  and recorded million of expense related to a contingent liability 
on december   we acquired hcl technologies shares in hps  and changed the name of hps to perot systems tsi bv  which now operates as our technology services line of business 
because of the late december closing of this acquisition  the post acquisition results of operations of tsi were not material to our consolidated results of operations for as a result  we continued to account for tsi s results of operations using the equity method of accounting through december   and the balance of our investment in tsi at december   was million 
we consolidated the assets and liabilities of tsi as of december  other income expense  net  was million of income in as compared to million of expense in during  we recorded non investment interest income of million and a million gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities 
during  we recorded a million loss when we divested our equity investment in billingzone  a start up joint venture 
our effective tax rate for income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for was 
income tax expense for was reduced by million primarily due to the impact of our non us operations 
our effective tax rate for was 
income tax expense for included a 
table of contents million benefit from the reduction of a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets as well as million of other tax benefits 
expected effect of the end of our outsourcing contract with ubs ubs ag is our largest customer 
during  our ubs relationship generated million  or  of our revenue  which included million of revenue and million of gross profit from our outsourcing agreement with ubs that will end on january  we expect revenues for from our outsourcing contract with ubs to be approximately million  and we do not believe that the revenue and gross profit from ubs will materially change during the remaining term of the outsourcing contract 
as previously announced  we continue to expect that we will lose a substantial majority of our revenue and profit from ubs when our outsourcing contract with ubs ends on january  the impact of the expiration of the outsourcing agreement on our profits will be based in part on our ability to reduce our costs 
we expect that the expiration of the outsourcing agreement likely will have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability compared to the effect on our revenues 
we expect the services we provide to ubs following the end of the it services agreement will include offshore services  which are provided outside the scope of the outsourcing contract and currently represent million of annual revenue 
we have identified several operating efficiencies that we believe could reduce the expected negative impact on our operating income from the expiration of the it services agreement 
we expect to realize between million and million of annual operating efficiencies by the end of compared to our results in  including efficiencies we expect on existing fixed and unit priced contracts of million by the end of  reducing existing selling  general and administrative expenses by million by the end of with approximately million of this reduction coming from existing amortization expense during  and between million and million of other expense reductions that we expect to realize before the conclusion of the efficiencies were developed in conjunction with our long range planning activities 
the million of contract related efficiencies are based on the economic structure and projections for our fixed and unit priced contracts 
in determining our expected savings from contract efficiencies  we have  in some cases  made assumptions regarding our ability and expected cost to consolidate facilities  implement certain new information technology systems  and more efficiently staff the it function for a customer 
some commercial outsourcing contracts are structured in a manner where the immediate savings we guarantee for a customer results in the profitability of the contract increasing over its term 
we maintain and monitor these profitability projections on a regular basis 
the million of annual reductions to sg a expense are based on objectives set as part of our cost management program 
as part of the cost management program  we have established a management committee to specifically identify reductions in our sg a expense structure 
the committee has identified a number of reductions  including the reduction in amortization expense described above and certain personnel related expenses 
we have benchmarked planned sg a expenses based on sg a expenses for prior periods  after adjustment for the identified reductions 
material discretionary budget increases from the benchmarked amounts must be approved by a separate management committee 
for the other expense reductions of between million and million that we expect to realize before the conclusion of  we may reduce our employee related expenses in however  if other operational results and efficiencies produce a similar amount of profit improvement  we may determine that the other expense reductions of between million and million are not necessary 
we believe our ability to increase revenues will depend primarily on the success of our units focused on selling services to our healthcare market and to our government services and technology services lines of business  and we believe that we will continue to experience growth in these areas 
in addition to this growth  we plan to continue adding to our capabilities through acquisitions 
in expanding our business  we plan to add future sg a at approximately of new revenue long term  excluding the effect of acquisitions 

table of contents expected end of our outsourcing contract with a customer one of our top largest customers  other than ubs  has notified us that it intends to transition the services that we provide them to its new business partner over the next two to three years 
for the three years ended december   revenue from this customer has ranged between million and million  and gross profit has ranged between million and million 
we expect that the expiration of the outsourcing agreement likely will have a disproportionately large effect on our operating income compared to the effect on our revenues 
liquidity and capital resources we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operating activities  and the million available under the restated and amended revolving credit facility  which is discussed below  will provide us sufficient funds to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million as compared to decreases of million and million for and  respectively 
these changes in net cash flow between years are primarily a result of differences in the amount of cash provided by operating activities and amounts used during each year for investing activities 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in and million in the primary reasons for the changes in cash provided by operating activities for these three years  as described more fully below  are increases in earnings  changes in our accounts receivable balances at the end of each year  and changes in the amount of cash paid for our realignment activities  associate bonuses  income taxes  and deferred contract costs 
income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was million in  million in  and million in in addition  depreciation and amortization expense  which are non cash expenses  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in as compared to is due primarily to depreciation and amortization expense on property  equipment  and purchased software and intangible assets associated with tsi  which was acquired in december we typically collect our accounts receivable within days to days  and therefore our accounts receivable balance at the end of each period can change based on the amount of revenue for that period and the timing of collections from our customers  which can vary significantly from period to period 
during  our revenues increased as compared to  while our days sales outstanding decreased from days at december   to days at december   which resulted in a million use of cash from our accounts receivable balances 
days sales outstanding is calculated as our outstanding accounts receivable balance at the end of the year divided by revenue for the fourth quarter and multiplied by days 
days sales outstanding as of december   was days 
during   and  we made cash payments of million  million  and million  respectively  in connection with our actions in and to realign our operating structure 
bonuses paid to associates under our bonus plans in   and including payments of annual bonuses relating to the prior year s bonus plan were million  million  and million  respectively 
included in the bonus amounts that were paid each year were approximately million  million  and million of bonus payments that are reimbursable by our customers 
the amount of bonuses that we pay each year is based on several factors  including our financial performance and management s discretion 
during   and  we made net cash payments for income taxes of million  million  and million  respectively 
during  we increased our spending on deferred contract costs by approximately million as compared to deferred contract costs are included in other non current assets on the consolidated 
table of contents balance sheets 
partially offsetting this increase in spending is an increase in deferred revenue  which is included in deferred revenue and long term deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 
prior to  deferred contract costs were not significant 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for as compared to million for and million for these changes in cash used in investing activities are due primarily to net cash paid for acquisitions of businesses 
during  we paid million as additional consideration for acquisitions  including million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of soza  million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of adi  and million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of hps and one other company 
also during we received million of net proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities 
during  we paid million net cash for acquisitions  including million net cash for the acquisition of hps  million net cash for the acquisition of soza and million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of ars 
during  we paid million net cash for acquisitions  including million net cash for the acquisition of claim services resource group  inc  million of net cash for the acquisition of adi  and million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of ars 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for  million for  and million for during and  we received more proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to the exercise of more stock options to purchase common stock as compared to in addition  in we repurchased more shares of our class a common stock as compared to and we routinely maintain cash balances in certain european and asian currencies to fund operations in those regions 
during  foreign exchange rate fluctuations had a net positive impact on our non domestic cash balances by million  as the indian rupee  the euro and the british pound strengthened against the us dollar 
we hedge foreign exchange exposures that are likely to significantly impact net income or working capital

current portion of long term debt in june  we entered into an operating lease contract with a variable interest entity for the use of land and office buildings in plano  texas  including a data center facility 
as part of our adoption of fin  we began consolidating this entity beginning on december  upon consolidation  we recorded the debt between the variable interest entity and the financial institutions the lenders of million as long term debt at december   on our consolidated balance sheets 
the agreement was scheduled to mature in june with one optional two year extension  however  we do not intend to extend the agreement 
as a result  the amount outstanding of million is recorded as the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  on march   we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to pay the exercise amount of million for the purchase option under the operating lease and to pay certain other expenses 
our consolidated variable interest entity then repaid the amount due to the lenders 
credit facility on january   we entered into a three year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that allows us to borrow up to million 
on march   we executed a restated and amended agreement that expanded the facility to million and extended the term to years 
borrowings under the credit facility will be either through revolving loans or letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged the stock of one of our non domestic subsidiaries as security on the facility 
interest on borrowings varies with usage and begins at an alternate base rate  as defined in the credit facility agreement  or the libor rate plus an applicable spread based upon our debt ebitda ratio applicable on such date 
we are also required to pay a facility fee based upon the unused credit commitment and certain other fees related to letter of credit issuance 
the credit facility matures in march and requires certain financial covenants  including a debt ebitda ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio  each as defined in the credit facility agreement 
as discussed above  on march   we borrowed million against the credit facility 
purchase commitments we have agreements with three telecommunication service providers to purchase services from  or sell services on behalf of  these providers at varying annual levels 
we are currently satisfying the minimum purchase requirements for two of the vendors  both of which expire in and total approximately million for the contract with the third vendor requires the settlement in cash of any amount by which actual purchases for a commitment year are less than the minimum purchase commitment in the contract 
in and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of expense in direct cost of services related to such settlement payments  which includes a payment to this vendor in december for the expected shortfall for the remaining commitment year that ends march  other commitments and contingencies as discussed in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  we may be required to make additional payments related to two acquisitions  depending on these two companies achieving certain financial targets over designated time periods

in addition  we may be required to pay to the sellers of soza an additional payment of up to million in  of which up to may be paid in stock 
as discussed in note  termination of business relationships  to the consolidated financial statements  during we exited an under performing contract 
as a result of the exiting of this contract  we determined that certain contract related assets were impaired and additional expenses would be incurred related to the exiting of this contract  resulting in a loss of million recorded in direct cost of services 
this estimated loss represents our current estimate of the loss related to exiting this contract 
the amount of actual loss with respect to exiting this contract may exceed our current estimates 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is important to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services to our customers under contracts that contain various pricing mechanisms and other terms 
these services include infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
within these four categories of services  our contracts include non construction service deliverables  including technology and back office outsourcing  and construction service deliverables  such as application development 
accounting for revenue in single deliverable arrangements revenue for non construction service deliverables is recognized as the services are rendered in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which provides that revenues should be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under our policy  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when a final understanding between us and our customer exists as to the specific nature and terms of the services that we are going to provide  as documented in the form of a signed agreement between us and the customer 
revenue for non construction services priced under fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the longer of the term of the contract or the expected service period  regardless of the amounts that can be billed in each period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or our obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
if we are to provide a similar level of non construction services each period during the term of a contract  we would recognize the revenue on a straight line basis since our obligations are being fulfilled in a straight line pattern 
if our obligations are being fulfilled in a pattern that is not consistent over the term of a contract  then we would recognize revenue consistent with the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period 
in determining the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period  we consider the nature of the deliverables we are providing to the customer and whether the volume of those deliverables are easily measured  such as when we provide a contractual number of full time equivalent associate resources 
if the amount of our obligations fulfilled in each period is not easily distinguished by reference to the volumes of services provided  then we would recognize revenue on a straight line basis 

table of contents revenue for construction services that do not include a license to one of our software products is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  sop requires the use of the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and profit as our work progresses  and we generally use the cost or hours incurred to date to measure our progress towards completion 
this method relies on estimates of total expected costs or total expected hours to complete the construction service  which are compared to costs or hours incurred to date  to arrive at an estimate of how much revenue and profit has been earned to date 
because these estimates may require significant judgment  depending on the complexity and length of the construction services  the amount of revenues and profits that have been recognized to date are subject to revisions 
if we do not accurately estimate the amount of costs or hours required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then revenues and profits may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revenue for the sale of a license to one of our software products or the sale of services relating to a software license is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
in general  sop addresses the separation and the timing of revenue recognition for software and software related services  such as implementation and maintenance services 
revenue for services priced under time and materials contracts and unit priced contracts is recognized as the services are provided at the contractual unit price 
accounting for revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements prior to the adoption of eitf prior to our adoption of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  effective january  as discussed below  we accounted for revenue from arrangements containing both non construction and construction services  on a combined basis 
for such arrangements with both non construction and construction services  we recognized revenue and profit on all services combined using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the provisions of sop as described above  under the percentage of completion method  the amount of revenue and profit was determined based on the direct costs incurred to date as compared to the estimate of total expected direct costs at completion 
adoption of eitf on november   the fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf  regarding when an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
we were required to apply the provisions of eitf to all new arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  alternatively  we were permitted to apply eitf to existing arrangements and record the effect of adoption as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted eitf and changed our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables for both existing and prospective customer contracts 
our adoption of eitf effective january   resulted in an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
this adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenues associated with our long term fixed price contracts that include construction services  as each such contract had been accounted for as a single unit of accounting under the percentage of completion method using direct costs incurred to date as a measure of progress towards completion 
the direct costs incurred in providing the services under these long term fixed price contracts were greater in the early years of the contract as compared to the later years because of the additional construction and non construction services being performed in those early years  including the implementation of new technologies and re engineering of processes 
however  
table of contents the contract terms did not allow for us to bill separately for the majority of these additional services  including the construction services 
as a result  we were recognizing revenue in advance of the billings 
upon the adoption of eitf  we determined that the construction and non construction services would not satisfy the separation criteria of eitf  and therefore we were required to account for these services as a single unit of accounting and apply the most appropriate revenue recognition method to the entire arrangement  which was the straight line method 
since the majority of the billings on the affected contracts approximated the straight line method  we were required to reverse most of the unbilled revenue that we had recorded in advance of the customer billings 
this adjustment also includes approximately million approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  to recognize an estimated loss on a construction service included in a contract that we expected to be profitable in the aggregate over its term and that was accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
this contract is discussed further in note  termination of business relationships  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements subsequent to the adoption of eitf for those arrangements which contain both non construction and construction services  we first determine whether each service  or deliverable  meets the separation criteria of eitf in general  a deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the remaining deliverables in the arrangement 
each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each separate unit of accounting 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another separate unit of accounting 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each separate unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method for each separate unit of accounting as described previously based on the nature of the arrangement 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria of eitf are combined into one unit of accounting  and the appropriate revenue recognition method is applied 
in arrangements for both non construction and construction services  we may bill the customer prior to performing services  which would require us to record deferred revenue 
in other arrangements  we may perform services prior to billing the customer  which could require us to record unbilled receivables or to defer the costs associated with either the non construction or construction services  depending on the terms of the arrangement and the application of the revenue separation criteria of eitf in certain arrangements we may provide consideration to the customer at the beginning of a contract as an incentive  which is most commonly in the form of cash 
this consideration is recorded in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the related contract 
as a result of our adoption of eitf  we recognized revenues of approximately million and million during and  respectively  that were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which we recorded in the first quarter of these amounts were estimated as the amount by which unbilled revenue would have been reduced in these periods for those contracts impacted by the cumulative adjustment  based on the most recent percentage of completion models prepared for each contract during contract costs costs to deliver services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of set up costs and the cost of certain construction and non construction services for which the related revenues must be deferred under 
table of contents eitf or other accounting literature 
we defer and subsequently amortize certain set up costs related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to customers 
deferred contract set up costs may include costs incurred during the set up phase of a customer arrangement relating to data center migration  implementation of certain operational processes  employee transition  and relocation of key personnel 
we amortize deferred contract set up costs on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related contract 
useful lives range from three years up to a maximum of the term of the related customer contract 
for a construction service in a single deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the total amount that can be billed under the terms of the arrangement  then a loss would be recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable 
for a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the amount of revenue that is allocated to the separate construction service unit of accounting based on the relative fair value allocation  as limited to the amount that is not contingent  then the actual costs incurred to complete the construction service in excess of the allocated fair value would be deferred  up to the amount of the relative fair value  and amortized over the remaining term of the contract 
a loss would be recorded on a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement only if the total costs to complete the service exceeded the relative fair value of the service 
deferred contract costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related customer contract 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future discounted cash flows 
year end bonus plan one of our compensation methods is to pay to certain associates a year end bonus  which is based on associate and team performance  our financial results  and management s discretion 
the amount of bonus expense that we record each quarter is based on several factors  including our financial performance for that quarter  our latest expectations for full year results  and management s estimate of the amount of bonus to be paid at the end of the year 
as a result  the amount of bonus expense that we record in each quarter can vary significantly 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we could incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise the estimates and assumptions we used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
income tax expense consists of our current and deferred provisions for us and foreign income taxes 
at december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
based upon our estimates of future taxable income and review of available tax planning strategies  we believe it is more likely than not that only million of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance at december   of million relating primarily to certain foreign jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for and adequacy of this valuation allowance based on the expected realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for us income tax on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 
except for amounts that may be repatriated under section of the american jobs creation act of the act  we intend to either permanently reinvest our non us earnings or remit such earnings in a tax free manner 
the act was signed into law on october   and provides a temporary incentive through december   for us companies to repatriate income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from foreign subsidiaries  which results in an effective us federal tax rate on the dividends of 
all funds repatriated under the act must be invested in the us under a qualifying domestic reinvestment plan approved by our management and board of directors 
our management has not adopted a reinvestment plan and has not determined the amount of non us earnings to be repatriated in as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of income tax effects of repatriation at the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements  and  as provided for in fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  no income tax expense related to our possible repatriation has been recorded as of december  we expect to finalize our assessment of the act by the end of the third quarter of however  a preliminary analysis suggests we may repatriate up to million of cash and incur up to approximately million of additional tax expense in the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings as calculated for income tax purposes of our non us subsidiaries was approximately million at december   and million at december  such earnings include pre acquisition earnings of non us entities acquired through stock purchases and  unless distributed under section are intended to be invested outside of the us indefinitely 
the ultimate tax liability related to repatriation of such earnings is dependent upon future tax planning opportunities and is not estimable at the present time 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates  and the application of complex tax regulations 
as a global company  we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
we are subject to income tax audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in additional tax liabilities 
changes to our recorded income tax liabilities resulting from the resolution of open tax matters are reflected in income tax expense in the period of resolution 
other factors may cause us to revise our estimates of income tax liabilities including the expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax regulations  and tax rulings 
changes in estimates of income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in our change in estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

table of contents significant accounting standards to be adopted statement of financial accounting standards board no 
r in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards board no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fas fas r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  which is allowed under the original provisions of fas fas r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of fas r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  if we had applied the provisions of fas r to the financial statements for the period ending december   net income would have been reduced by approximately million 
fas r allows for either modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or modified retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of fas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we currently plan to apply the provisions of fas r on a modified prospective basis for the recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards granted on or after july  and any awards that are not fully vested as of june  compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in preparing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of fas related party transactions we are providing information technology and energy management services for hillwood enterprise lp  which is controlled and partially owned by ross perot  jr 
this contract will expire on april  this contract includes provisions under which we may be penalized if our actual performance does not meet the levels of service specified in the contract  and such provisions are consistent with those included in other customer contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded revenue of million  million  and million and direct cost of services of million  million  and million  respectively 
prior to entering into this arrangement  our audit committee reviewed and approved this contract 
during  we entered into a sublease agreement with perot services company  llc  which is controlled and owned by ross perot  for approximately  square feet of office space at our plano  texas facility 
rent over the term of the lease is approximately million per year 
the initial lease term is years with one optional year renewal period 
the lease also provides for us to pay a million allowance for modifications to the leased space 
perot services will pay all modification costs in excess of the allowance 
prior to entering into this arrangement  our audit committee reviewed and approved this contract 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
we generally manage these transactions by ensuring that costs to service these contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
by matching revenues and costs to the same currency  we have been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
we use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions when necessary 
we do not foresee changing our foreign currency exposure management strategy 
our hedging activities expanded in due to increased foreign currency exposures resulting from our acquisition of the remaining interests in perot systems tsi bv during   or million of our revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change revenue by  or million 
in our opinion  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
