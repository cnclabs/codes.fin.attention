the segment s sales are concentrated primarily page of 
table of contents in north america and europe 
the electrical segment experiences modest seasonal increases in sales during the second and third quarters reflecting the construction season 
net sales for the electrical segment for the past three years were segment sales in millions percent of consolidated net sales the electrical segment designs  manufactures and markets thousands of different connectors  components and other products for electrical  utility and communications applications 
we have a market leading position for many of our products 
products in the electrical segment include fittings and accessories for electrical raceways  fastening products  such as plastic and metallic ties for bundling wire  and flexible tubing  connectors  such as compression and mechanical connectors for high current power and grounding applications  indoor and outdoor switch and outlet boxes  covers and accessories  floor boxes  metal framing used as structural supports for conduits  cable tray and electrical enclosures  emergency and hazardous lighting  safety switches  underground connectors and switchgear  catv drop hardware  radio frequency rf connectors  aerial  pole  pedestal and buried splice enclosures  encapsulation and sheath repair systems  and other products  including insulation products  wire markers  and application tooling products 
these products are sold under a variety of well known brand names  such as color keyed  elastimold  kindorf  red dot  sta kon  steel city  superstrut  ty rap  lrc  diamond  kold n klose and snap n seal 
demand for electrical products follows general economic conditions and is sensitive to activity in construction markets  industrial production levels and spending by utilities for replacements  expansions and efficiency improvements 
the segment s product lines are predominantly sold through major distributor chains  thousands of independent distributors and  to a lesser extent  to retail home centers and hardware outlets 
they are also sold directly to original equipment manufacturers  utilities  cable operators  and telecommunications and satellite tv companies 
we have strong relationships with our distributors as a result of the breadth and quality of our product lines  our market leading service programs  our strong history of product innovation  and the high degree of brand name recognition for our products among end users 
page of 
table of contents steel structures segment our steel structures segment designs  manufactures and markets highly engineered tubular steel transmission and distribution poles and lattice steel transmission towers for north american power and telecommunications companies 
these products are primarily sold to the following types of end users investor owned utilities  cooperatives  which purchase power from utilities and manage its distribution to end users  municipal utilities  and telephone companies 
these products are marketed primarily under the meyer and thomas betts brand names 
net sales for the steel structures segment for the past three years were segment sales in millions percent of consolidated net sales hvac segment our hvac segment designs  manufactures and markets heating and ventilation products for commercial and industrial buildings 
products in this segment include gas  oil and electric unit heaters  gas fired duct furnaces  indirect and direct gas fired make up air heaters  infrared heaters  and evaporative cooling and heat recovery products 
these products are sold primarily under the reznor brand name through hvac  mechanical and refrigeration distributors throughout north america and europe 
demand for hvac products tends to be higher when customers are experiencing cold weather and  as a result  hvac has higher sales in the first and fourth quarters 
to reduce the impact of seasonality on operations  the segment offers an off season promotional program with its distributors 
net sales for the hvac segment for the past three years were segment sales in millions percent of consolidated net sales manufacturing and distribution we employ advanced processes for manufacturing quality products 
our manufacturing processes include high speed stamping  precision molding  machining  plating and automated assembly 
we make extensive use of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing cad cam software and equipment to link product engineering with our manufacturing facilities 
we also utilize other advanced equipment and techniques in the manufacturing and page of 
table of contents distribution process  including computer software for scheduling  material requirements planning  shop floor control  capacity planning  and the warehousing and shipment of products 
our products have historically enjoyed a reputation for quality in the markets in which they are sold 
to ensure maintenance of our quality standards  all of our facilities embrace quality programs  and as of december   approximately meet the iso standard 
additionally  we have implemented quality control processes in our design  manufacturing  delivery and other operations in order to further improve product quality and customer service levels 
raw materials we purchase a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of our products including steel  aluminum  zinc  copper  resins and rubber compounds 
sources for raw materials and component parts are well established and  with the exception of steel  are sufficiently numerous to avoid serious future interruptions of production in the event that current suppliers are unable to provide raw materials and component parts sufficient to meet our needs 
however  our industry has experienced a reduction in the number of steel suppliers during the past two years due to consolidation 
given the current tight supply of steel  we could encounter manufacturing disruptions in each of our segments from sporadic interruptions by our steel suppliers 
in addition  we could encounter price increases  especially for steel  that we may not be able to pass on to our customers 
research and development we have research  development and engineering capabilities in each business segment and maintain facilities that respond to the needs of specific markets 
we have a long term reputation for innovation and value based upon our ability to develop products that meet the needs of the marketplace 
research  development and engineering expenditures invested into new and improved products and processes are shown below 
these expenses are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
r d expenditures in millions percent of net sales working capital practices we maintain sufficient inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers 
our inventory levels  payment terms and return policies are in accordance with general practices associated with the industries in which we operate 
patents and trademarks we own approximately  active patent registrations and applications worldwide 
we have over  active trademarks and domain names worldwide  including thomas betts  t b  t b access  blackburn  bowers  canstrut  catamount  color keyed  commander  deltec  diamond  duragard  elastimold  emergi lite  e z code  flex cuf  furse  hazlux  kindorf  klik it  kold n klose  lrc  marr  marrette  meyer  ocal  red dot  reznor  russellstoll  sachs  page of

while we consider our patents  trademarks  and trade dress to be valuable assets  we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent solely on patent or trademark protection or that any business segment or our operations as a whole is dependent on any individual patent or trademark 
however  the color keyed  elastimold  kindorf  red dot  sta kon  steel city  super strut  and ty rap trademarks are important to the electrical segment  the meyer trademark is important to the steel structures segment  and the reznor trademark is important to the hvac segment 
in addition  we do not consider any of our individual licenses  franchises or concessions to be material to our business as a whole or to any business segment 
competition our ability to continue to meet customer needs by enhancing existing products and developing and manufacturing new products is critical to our prominence in our primary market  the electrical products industry 
we have robust competition in all areas of our business  and the methods and levels of competition  such as price  service  warranty and product performance  vary among our markets 
while no single company competes with us in all of our product lines  various companies compete with us in one or more product lines 
some of these competitors have substantially greater sales and assets and greater access to capital than we do 
we believe thomas betts is among the industry leaders in service to its customers 
we continually work to enhance our product offerings as do our competitors who are likely to develop new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics 
although we believe that we have specific technological and other advantages over some of our competitors  because of the intensity of competition in the product areas and geographic markets that we serve  we could experience increased downward pressure on the selling prices for some of our products 
the abilities of our competitors to enhance their own products  coupled with any unforeseeable changes in customer demand for various products of thomas betts  could affect our overall product mix  pricing  margins  plant utilization levels and asset valuations 
we believe that industry consolidation could further increase competitive pressures 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees worldwide 
employees of our foreign subsidiaries in the aggregate comprise approximately of all employees 
of the total number of employees  approximately one third are represented by trade unions 
we believe our relationships with our employees and trade unions are good 
compliance with environmental regulations we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air  soil and water  as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we believe that we are in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of maintaining such compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will not be material to our financial position or results of operations

item legal proceedings kaiser litigation by july   kaiser aluminum  its property insurers  kaiser injured workers  nearby businesses and a class of  residents near the kaiser facility in louisiana  filed product liability and business interruption cases against the corporation and six other defendants in louisiana state court seeking damages in excess of million 
these cases alleged that a thomas betts cable tie mounting base failed thereby allowing bundled cables to come in contact with a kv energized bus bar 
this alleged electrical fault supposedly initiated a series of events culminating in an explosion  which leveled acres of the kaiser facility 
a seven week trial in the fall resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the corporation 
however  months later  the trial court overturned that verdict in granting plaintiffs judgment notwithstanding the verdict motions 
on december   the trial court judge found the thomas betts product  an adhesive backed mounting base  to be unreasonably dangerous and therefore assigned fault to t b 
the judge set the damages for an injured worker at million and the damages for kaiser at million 
the judgment did not address damages for nearby businesses or  residents near the kaiser facility 
the corporation s allocation is million  plus legal interest 
the corporation has appealed this ruling 
management believes there are meritorious defenses to the claim and intends to contest the litigation vigorously 
the appeal required a bond in the amount of million the judgment plus legal interest 
plaintiffs successfully moved the trial court to increase the bond to million 
the corporation s liability insurers have secured the million bond 
the corporation has not reflected a liability in its financial statements for the kaiser litigation because management believes meritorious defenses exist for this claim and thus management does not believe a loss is probable 
further  until there are new developments in the case that would provide more definitive amounts  management cannot provide any better range of possible losses than zero to the amount of the judgment 
when evaluating the impact of the judgment on the corporation s liquidity  investors should note that the corporation has insurance coverage in excess of the judgment 
the nearby businesses have made demands for unspecified damages  but to date  no discovery has taken place 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation and the class of  residents reached settlement for claims by the class members 
the settlement extinguishes the claims of all class members and includes indemnity of the corporation against future potential claims asserted by class members or those class members who opted out of the settlement process 
also in the fourth quarter  the court approved the class settlement at a fairness hearing 
the million class settlement amount has been paid directly by an insurer of the corporation into a trust for the benefit of class members

table of contents asbestos cases the corporation and two subsidiaries  amerace corporation and le mason red dot  acquired respectively in and  are subject to asbestos lawsuits in mississippi  new jersey and four other states  related to either undefined and unidentified or historic products 
in all cases  the corporation is investigating these allegations 
amerace is one of hundreds of defendants and red dot and the corporation are one of dozens of defendants in each case 
no asbestos containing product of amerace  red dot or thomas betts has been identified in these cases to date 
in the amerace cases  ten lawsuits have already been dismissed 
potential exposure at this time  if any  cannot be estimated 
management believes  however  that there is no merit to these claims  that damages  if any  are remote and believes that a loss is not probable in any of these cases 
insurance coverage is available in connection with these claims 
other legal matters the corporation is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in those cases where we are the defendant  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts or other types of relief and some matters may remain unresolved for several years 
such matters may be subject to many uncertainties and outcomes which are not predictable with assurance 
we consider the gross probable liability when determining whether to accrue for a loss contingency for a legal matter 
we have provided for losses to the extent probable and estimable 
the legal matters that have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements are based on gross assessments of expected settlement or expected outcome 
additional losses  even though not anticipated  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in any given period 
environmental matters owners and operators of sites containing hazardous substances  as well as generators of hazardous substances  are subject to broad and retroactive liability for investigatory and cleanup costs and damages arising out of past disposal activities 
such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity 
we have been notified by the united states environmental protection agency or similar state environmental regulatory agencies or private parties that we  in many instances along with others  may currently be potentially responsible for the remediation of sites pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended  similar federal and state environmental statutes  or common law theories 
we  along with others  may be held jointly and severally liable for all costs relating to investigation and remediation of sites pursuant to these environmental laws 
we are the owner or operator  or former owner or operator  of various manufacturing locations that we are currently evaluating for the presence of contamination that may require remediation 
these sites include former or inactive facilities or properties in alabama mobile  connecticut monroe  indiana medora  illinois libertyville  massachusetts attleboro  boston  canton  new hampshire new milford  new jersey butler  elizabeth  garwood  new york horseheads  pennsylvania perkasie  pittsburgh  ohio bucyrus and oklahoma stillwater 
the sites further include active manufacturing locations in new jersey hackettstown  new mexico albuquerque  south carolina lancaster  and wisconsin hager city 
four of these current and former manufacturing locations relate to activities of american electric for the period prior to our acquisition of that company 
these four sites are located in page of 
table of contents hager city  wisconsin  lancaster  south carolina  medora  indiana  and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
each of these sites  except for pittsburgh is subject to an asset purchase agreement dated june  between american electric and itt corporation 
itt and thomas betts have shared responsibilities and costs at the four outstanding sites subject to this agreement 
for certain of the sites covered by this agreement  itt agreed to indemnify american electric for environmental liabilities  if any  that occurred prior to the purchase of the facilities by american electric 
we believe that the indemnity of itt is reliable  however  we have no assurances that these indemnities will be honored 
in  we acquired augat inc augat previously evaluated or remediated  and may have liability associated with environmental contamination at a number of sites 
pursuant to a purchase agreement  dated july   between the corporation and tyco group sarl  we agreed to retain certain environmental liabilities  if any  for former augat manufacturing locations in alabama montgomery plants  massachusetts mashpee and south carolina inman  and for four offsite alleged disposal locations 
in november  we acquired kaufel group  ltd 
pursuant to the various environmental laws and regulations described above  we are evaluating  and may have liability associated with contamination at two facilities owned and operated by kaufel in dorval  quebec 
we have provided for liabilities to the extent probable and estimable  but we are not able to predict the extent of our ultimate liability with respect to all of these pending or future environmental matters 
however  we believe that any additional liability with respect to the aforementioned environmental matters will not be material to our financial position or results of operations

net sales were also positively impacted by approximately million of foreign currency exchange 
electrical segment earnings in were up million  or  from this significant improvement reflects increased sales volumes  which provided better fixed cost absorption 
higher raw materials costs experienced in had a minimal impact on current year results  as they were offset through higher selling prices for electrical segment products and through operational improvements 
year compared with electrical segment net sales in were flat with after including the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately million 
the underlying sales shortfall was mainly due to lower volumes in our us markets 
the weakness in the utility market for electrical connectors and switchgear was seen primarily in the first half of electrical segment earnings for reflect manufacturing efficiency improvements derived from our manufacturing restructuring program which were offset primarily by the impact from lower sales volumes in our us electrical markets 
electrical segment results in included million of charges associated with our manufacturing restructuring program 
both and results reflect the negative impact of running our manufacturing plants at the lower range of practical capacity utilization due to weak industry demand 
in addition  sales and segment earnings in were adversely impacted by a million charge for exposure associated with the bankruptcy of a large cable tv customer 
finally  during the first quarter of and the year  the segment had assets classified as held for sale and consequently suspended depreciation of million and million  respectively 
other segments year compared with net sales in in our steel structures segment were up million  or  from higher net sales reflect strengthening demand by utilities to upgrade or expand regional electrical transmission grids and sales price increases related to higher raw material costs 
steel structures segment earnings in were up million  or  from this significant improvement reflects increased sales volumes and improved operating efficiencies from operating at near capacity levels 
net sales in in our hvac segment were up million  or  from higher net sales reflect sales price increases related to higher raw material costs and positive impacts from foreign currency exchange 
net sales in were also negatively impacted by relatively mild winter weather conditions in the united states 
hvac segment earnings in were up million  or  from this improvement reflects disciplined cost controls and improved operating efficiencies 
year compared with net sales and segment earnings in our steel structures segment for were significantly lower than as a result of reduced and delayed investment by the utility sector for transmission systems 
operational improvements such as reducing manufacturing costs and page of 
table of contents sg a expenses were more than offset by the negative impact of significantly lower sales volumes 
our hvac segment s net sales increased approximately compared with the increase was due primarily to including a full year of results from a small european acquisition made in late and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange 
the improvement in segment earnings over was mainly due to reduced manufacturing costs primarily in our north american operations and  to a lessor extent  the impact of the previously mentioned european acquisition 
page of 
table of contents business risks there are many factors that could pose a risk to the corporation s business and its ability to execute its business plan  some of which are beyond its control 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks related to credit quality of customers although the corporation is not dependent on any one customer for more than of its sales  deterioration in the credit quality of several major customers at the same time could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
negative economic conditions may adversely affect performance the success of thomas betts business is directly linked to positive economic conditions in the countries where it sells its products 
material adverse changes in economic or industry conditions generally or in the specific markets served by thomas betts could adversely affect the future financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
additionally  continued economic slowdown in the us or in thomas betts major foreign markets  including canada and europe  could reduce the corporation s overall net sales 
because these influences are not always foreseeable  there can be no assurance that the business will not be affected by these occurrences 
availability of steel supply we have experienced a reduction in the number of steel suppliers during the past two years as a result of consolidation in the steel industry 
given increased worldwide demand  the availability of steel is a concern 
if we are unable to regularly obtain the steel that we need to manufacture products  our business could be materially disrupted 
changes in customer demand as thomas betts works to enhance its product offerings  its competitors will most likely continue to improve their products and will likely develop new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics 
although thomas betts believes that it has specific technological and other advantages over certain of its competitors  because of the intensity of the competition in the product areas and geographic markets that it serves  thomas betts could experience increased downward pressure on the selling prices for certain of its products 
the activities of the corporation s competitors designed to enhance their own product offerings  coupled with any unforeseeable changes in customer demand for various products of thomas betts  could affect the corporation s overall product mix  pricing  margins  plant utilization levels and asset valuations 
adverse regulatory  environmental  monetary or other governmental policies which may affect profitability thomas betts is subject to governmental regulations throughout the world 
unforeseen changes in these governmental regulations may reduce its profitability 
namely  significant changes in monetary or fiscal policies in the us and abroad could result in currency fluctuations  including fluctuations in the canadian dollar  euro and british pound  which  in turn  could adversely affect thomas betts net sales  costs and expenses 
furthermore  page of 
table of contents significant changes in any number of governmental policies could create trade restrictions  patent enforcement issues  adverse tax rate changes and changes to tax treatment of items such as tax credits  withholding taxes  transfer pricing and other income and expense recognition for tax purposes  including the us federal tax benefits derived from the corporation s puerto rico operations which are set to expire on december  these changes might limit thomas betts ability to sell its products in certain markets  and could negatively affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  thomas betts operations are subject to international  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental matters  including emissions to air  discharge to waters and the generation and handling of waste 
thomas betts is also subject to laws relating to occupational health and safety 
the operation of manufacturing plants involves a high level of susceptibility in these areas  and there is no assurance that thomas betts will not incur material environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities in the future 
moreover  expectations of remediation expenses could be affected by  and potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with  environmental regulations and health and safety laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
future remediation technology advances could adversely impact expectations of remediation expenses 
adequacy of insurance in accordance with its risk management practices  the corporation continually reevaluates risks  their potential cost and the cost of minimizing them 
to reduce the corporation s exposure to material risks  in certain circumstances  it purchases insurance 
certain risks are inherent in the manufacturing of the corporation s products and the corporation s insurance may not be adequate to cover potential claims against it involving its products 
the corporation is also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of products 
although the corporation maintains liability insurance  management cannot assure that the coverage limits under these insurance programs will be adequate to protect thomas betts against future claims  or that the corporation can and will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
terrorist acts and acts of war terrorist acts and acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors or customers  which could significantly impact our net sales  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  as a global company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by acts of war 
however  our insurers have confirmed coverage for losses caused by terrorist acts within our policy limits 
page of 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue when finished products are shipped to unaffiliated customers and both title and risks of ownership are transferred 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded in the period as a reduction of revenue in which the sale is recognized 
quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans  which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers 
certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling the corporation s products into targeted construction projects or markets 
following a distributor s sale of an eligible product  the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate 
the corporation provides additional allowances for bad debts when circumstances dictate 
a number of distributors  primarily in the electrical segment  have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
management analyzes historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  the corporation periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories 
the corporation also periodically performs an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires a transitional and annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets associated with reporting units for indications of impairment 
the corporation performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 each test of goodwill requires the corporation to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the corporation must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
see note in the notes to the page of 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment charge of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and other transitional disclosure information 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  the corporation evaluates assets for associated product groups 
the corporation reviews long lived assets to be held and used for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values are not available  the corporation estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provides a valuation allowance based on a more likely than not criteria 
the corporation has valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deferred state income tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the corporation s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of its tax planning strategies 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax law in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies  which involve estimates and uncertainties  in making this assessment 
tax planning strategies include primarily sales of non core assets 
projected future taxable income is based on management s forecast of the operating results of the corporation 
management periodically reviews such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends 
in the event management determines that sufficient future taxable income  in light of tax planning strategies  may not be generated to fully realize net deferred tax assets  the corporation will increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of current available facts related to each site

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments thomas betts is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  raw material prices and foreign exchange rates 
at times  we may enter into various derivative instruments to manage certain of these risks 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and use a combination of fixed and floating rate debt to manage this exposure 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of our borrowings and to balance our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments
