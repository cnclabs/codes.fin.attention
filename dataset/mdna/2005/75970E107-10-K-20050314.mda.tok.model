employment saw appreciable gains as the unemployment rate dropped from to for year end from with federal monetary policy accommodative  coupled with both an increase in hourly wages and in the non farm work week  household spending remained resilient 
business investment in equipment and inventories improved despite higher oil prices 
the consumer price inflation index moved higher  ending the year at  up from at the end of driven largely by energy prices 
while up from  the core consumer price index was 
as began  hiring by businesses nationally did not increase appreciably 
the unemployment rate remained steady through the first quarter 
despite a slower beginning  it became more evident during the second quarter that the country s economic expansion was solidifying 
on the business front  capacity utilization began increasing in the second quarter 
in addition  both housing permits and new home sales were up 
the federal open market committee the fomc  which sets federal monetary policy  appears to have become more confident that the economy was gaining strength and began to recognize that its accommodative stance for monetary policy could not be maintained 
during the first quarter of  the federal funds interest rate remained at a low of with a prime rate 
the fomc  however  changed its bias position from accommodative to one of balance 
the language in its policy statement was modified to give the fomc greater flexibility to tighten monetary policy should circumstances warrant 
at its meeting on june  the federal funds rate was increased by basis points as the reported economic data pointed to a firmly established expansion 
the fomc indicated that their policy would need to move toward a more neutral stance  but not at a rapid rate 
during  the fomc raised the federal funds rate five times  each increase was basis points 
by the end of the year  the federal funds rate was and was in line with the fomc s assessment of balanced risk in relation to sustainable growth and price stability 
the prime rate was 
during the fourth quarter  both consumer and investment spending remained solid 
in addition  employment gains in the quarter were consistent with a continued improvement in the labor market 
spending for automobiles was robust 
disposable personal income rose almost with a increase for real gdp 
locally  in we operated in northeast mississippi and southwest tennessee 
the most vibrant markets for the company in were located in lee and desoto counties in mississippi and shelby county in tennessee 
both lee and desoto counties again ranked in the top counties in the state for gross retail sales 
during  retail sales increased in desoto county by  totaling almost billion 
while unemployment was mixed within our market area  a number of the counties experienced an increase in unemployment 
while we experienced loan growth in most markets  the most notable increases during originated in lee and desoto counties 
our loan growth  excluding the loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of renasant bancshares  exceeded with a growth in desoto county 
loans in lee county grew during critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts 
wherever feasible  we utilize third party information to provide management with estimates 
although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process  management evaluates the results and challenges assumptions used and other factors which could impact the estimation 
the following discussion presents some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements 

table of contents the critical accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan loss and the related provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment as recognized under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade 
another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under statement  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan statement 
the balance of these loans determined to be impaired under statement and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments  the unemployment rate in our market  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses 
prior to  the allowance for loan losses was allocated based on the business purpose of the loan 
in  management changed methods  basing the allocation on the underlying collateral securing the loan 
this change was made to assist management in better evaluating risk within the entire loan portfolio due to changes in economic conditions  as well as to better evaluate collateral concentration 
this allocation method also provides management with a better tool to risk grade loans  since historical losses can now be compared by loan category collateral based 
the only impact from changing to a collateral based method resulted in a number of loans that had previously been classified as commercial  financial  and agricultural loans prior to to subsequently being classified as either real estate family mortgage  if the collateral for the loans was secured by debtors residences  or real estate commercial  if the underlying collateral was commercial real estate 
the change in allocation methods did not impact the allowance required 
for a discussion of our loan policies and procedures  please refer to the disclosures in this item under the heading risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses 
goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in our banking and insurance operations 
the value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition 
as such  the value of our goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue which is driven by the volume of business transacted and the market share acquired 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
our independent actuary firm prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under fasb statement no 
 as modified by fasb statement no 
 and our post retirement health cost under fasb statement no 
the discount rate used in the valuation was  down from in actual plan assets as of december  were used in the calculation and the expected long term return on plan assets assumed for this valuation was 
the pension plan covered under fasb statement no 
was curtailed as of december  we believe we employ appropriate methods for these calculations and that the results of such calculations closely approximate the actual cost 
we review the calculated results for reasonableness and compare those calculations to prior period costs 
we also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations 
we monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of newly issued accounting standards is discussed in further detail in note a significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of adopting statement in is discussed in this item under the heading results of operations net income

diluted eps  roa roe were   and  respectively in eps growth reflects changes from the immediately preceding year 
a number of factors contributed to the 
decline in eps during the most significant impact resulted from the dilutive effect of the renasant bancshares acquisition of approximately 
in addition  an impairment charge on the fnma and fhlmc securities reduced eps by  this decrease was largely offset by the gain of 
on the sale of the merchant business  for a net effect of an approximately 
decrease in eps from these two factors 
the remainder of changes in eps during are primarily attributable to growth in net interest income 
the eps growth was the result of decreases in net interest margin and loan loss provision  significant growth in noninterest income  and moderate growth in noninterest expense 
the growth in eps in and was due to improved net interest margin  lower loan loss provision expense  and significant improvements in noninterest income 
the decline in eps growth for was due largely to the recognition of a  gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio in in addition  in  we experienced a decrease in net interest income as well as credit problems that resulted in a higher than normal loan loss provision

noninterest income grew during by  or  to  as compared to due primarily to gains on sale of mortgage loans as we experienced unprecedented mortgage loan volumes 
in  we recorded a transitional impairment of  on intangible assets recorded in connection with previously acquired goodwill 
this impairment was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
since the insurance subsidiaries were acquired through tax free exchanges  there was no tax benefit to offset the impairment 
as a direct result of improved credit quality  we recorded a loan loss provision during of  a decrease from net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  is the largest component of our net income  comprising of total revenue in the primary concerns in managing net interest income are the mix and the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
in june  the federal reserve board began a series of five basis point increases in its federal funds rate 
while there are a number of options available for improving net interest income  we focused on increasing the volume of our loans  particularly variable rate loans  and keeping our deposit costs low 
income from our loan portfolio  on a tax equivalent basis  grew during as average loans grew 
at december   variable rate loans represented of our loan portfolio compared to of the loan portfolio at december  by focusing on increasing our variable rate loans  we have better positioned ourselves to take advantage of interest rates as interest rates continue to rise 
in addition  our net interest income increased due to our ability to keep our deposit costs low 
the cost of interest bearing deposits during was  a decrease of basis points from the rate paid in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased  or  from  in to  in of the increase in net interest income  the increase due to the favorable growth in the volume of net earning assets of  was offset by the changes in interest rates of interest income grew to  for from  from the growth in interest income was driven by volume  as the average balance in interest earning assets increased  during  while the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points to 
interest expense remained flat for at  as compared to  for despite average interest bearing liabilities growing 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in  or basis points 
during  the asset liability management committee was assertive in making pricing decisions that enhanced net interest income 
since the balance sheet was liability sensitive at that time  the falling interest rate environment was conducive to increasing net interest income 
in contrast  during we began repricing a significant portion of our assets at lower rates 
loan growth on a period to period basis was relatively flat due to the sluggish economy 
as a result of low interest rates  approximately  of in house mortgages sought permanent financing in the secondary market  moving from short term loans with renasant bank to traditional long term mortgage loans that 
table of contents are sold upon closing 
this shift  combined with the continual decline in our sales finance loan program that was discontinued in and the increase in the volume of the prepayments of our mortgage backed securities  had a significant impact on net interest income in with the basis points drop in interest rates in june of  we began experiencing a significant acceleration in the volume of prepayments of our mortgage backed securities in the third quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  those securities were back to more normal prepayment speeds  reducing the premium amortization 
the increase in rates in the fourth quarter of resulted in much lower mortgage loan volume and normal prepayment volume on mortgage backed securities 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased  or  from  in to  in of the tax equivalent decrease  an increase of  due to the favorable growth in net earning assets was more than offset by a decrease of  due to changes in interest rates

the table below shows the impact that the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities had on the change in net interest margin for as shown  the increase in volume of earning assets resulted in an increase of 
in net interest margin 
the increase was more than offset by the effect of the decline of

we did not experience the decrease in mortgage loans due to homeowner refinancing in as we did in the growth generated during is attributable to the steps management took during and fewer customers in refinancing loans into fixed mortgage loan products 
during  management committed to the task of growing loans through our expansion into more attractive markets  as well as  through the strategic hires of lending personnel located in those higher growth markets 
total loans at december  only grew  or  from december  in  we experienced a significant decrease in average mortgage loans of  as customers refinanced into fixed mortgage loan products given the historic low rates available during this time 
this decrease was more than offset by an increase in average commercial loans of  and an increase in lines of credit of  both with lower yields than the mortgage loans

this program provides the client with a choice of seven value priced transaction accounts 
the cornerstone of this program is the free  full service checking account 
the increase in demand deposits and non public interest bearing transaction accounts in was partially offset by decreases in public fund interest bearing transaction accounts and time deposits 
these deposit types  exclusive of similar deposit types acquired in connection with our acquisition of renasant bancshares  decreased  and  respectively  at december   to december  public funds  one of a number of alternatives that the company utilizes to meet its liquidity needs  may be readily obtained based on the company s aggressiveness in pricing 
the source of funds that we select depends on the terms and how those terms assist us in mitigating interest rate risk 
interest spread is the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest paid on costing liabilities 
because we are cognizant of interest spread  funds are only acquired when needed and at a rate that is prudent under the circumstances 
normally  public fund time deposits are higher costing due to the volume of the deposits and because they are obtained through a bid process 
if demand for those funds rises  the cost of those deposits increases and vice versa 

table of contents the trend of decreasing time deposits has continued as customers have kept their deposits very liquid with expectations of higher interest rates 
rates paid on time deposits ranged from 
to at the end of at december   the balance of demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits increased  and  respectively  as compared to the balance at december  the growth is attributable to the implementation of the hpc program and customers shifting their time deposits into more liquid interest bearing accounts

the interest expense effect of the increase in the average balance more than offset the decrease in interest expense due to the decline in the rates paid on borrowed funds 
throughout  the company relied more heavily than in past years on borrowed funds as we faced difficulty in generating sufficient deposits to meet the loan demand

funds were borrowed from the federal home loan bank to match fund against certain loans  negating interest rate exposure when rates rise 
such match funded loans are typically large commercial or real estate loans 
in addition  the company issued  in junior subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of to provide funds for the renasant bancshares acquisition and to meet other capital resource needs 
this issuance increased our interest expense on borrowed funds for by as compared to the junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a rate equal to month libor plus basis points 
at december   the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures was 
interest expense on total borrowings was  in  up from due to an increase of  in the average balance of total borrowings

table of contents total noninterest income includes fees generated from deposit services  loan services  insurance products  trust and other wealth management products and services  security gains  and all other noninterest income 
our focus over the last years has been to develop and enhance our products for generating noninterest income 
we believe our new markets in tennessee and alabama will provide us with opportunities to further grow our noninterest income 
for  noninterest income was  an increase of over  or 
as discussed below  noninterest income for includes a  other than temporary impairment charge on certain fnma and fhlmc preferred securities

the securities pay a dividend based on treasury rates and reset periodically 
during the fourth quarter of  these agencies issued new securities as part of a settlement reached with federal regulatory agencies 
these newly issued securities had terms which were more favorable than the securities we hold 
prior to the issuance  the fair market value of the securities was below their carrying value due to increases in interest rates 
although the securities we hold are rated aa and aa by standard poor and moody s  respectively  we concluded that the decline in the market value of the securities  in light of the new security issuance  was other than temporary 
thus  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of the impairment is shown in the income statement line item securities losses gains 
excluding the impairment charge  gains on sale of securities for were security gains of for resulted from  in security sales  primarily from the sale of mortgage backed securities 
securities gains of for resulted from  in security sales 
these  too  were primarily mortgage backed securities that were sold to eliminate those securities with maturity concentrations or accelerated prepayments 
sales also included securities in us government agency  obligation of state and political subdivision  and other preferred stock sectors 
on june   we sold our interest in and rights to future revenue on credit card merchant agreements involving point of sale based credit card  debit card and other card based transaction processing services  electronic payment and settlement services to nova information systems  inc nova 
the sale involved approximately  credit card merchant processing accounts along with an insignificant amount of hardware consisting of approximately credit card terminals and printers 
in connection with the sale  nova assumed financial liability for merchant transactions from the date of the sale 
we will no longer continue to receive merchant discount revenue 
we will receive referral fees from nova  although such fees will likely be significantly less than our merchant discount revenue 
revenue from merchant servicing was   and  for the years ended december   and charges for deposit services  a major contributor to noninterest income  were  for  an increase of or from the acquisition of renasant bancshares contributed of this increase 
the primary reason for the increase is the success of the hpc program in increasing the number of service chargeable deposit accounts 
service charges include maintenance fees on accounts  per item charges  account enhancement charges for additional packaged benefits and overdraft fees 
service charges on deposits in were  the increase in service charges during of  was primarily associated with the increase in accounts due to the hpc program initiated in fees and commissions which includes fees charged for both deposit services and loan services increased  or to  during as compared to  for fees recorded from deposit services increased  or  over similar fees generated for income derived from use of our debit cards made up of the total increase in deposit related fees for fees recorded for loan services decreased from as a result of the decrease in origination of mortgage loans for sale  mortgage loan fees decreased fees charged on mortgage loans originated for sale include title insurance  underwriting fees  and origination fees 
this decrease was partially offset by increased fees generated for other loans  particularly commercial  as a result of increased volume 
fees and commissions increased  to  in from  in fees generated from deposit services increased  primarily from income derived from use of our debit cards and the sale of alternative financial products such as mutual funds and annuities 
fees generated from loan services increased over  largely due to the record volume of mortgages originated for sale

the new system has more functionality and provides the teller with more information about the client 
occupancy expense in was up  or  from the increase due to the acquisition of renasant bancshares accounted for approximately of the increase 
the remainder was primarily due to additional depreciation and other occupancy costs incurred in connection with opening the new branch in horn lake  mississippi and the loan production office in oxford  mississippi

table of contents risk management the management of risk is an on going process 
primary risks that are associated with the company include credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
credit and interest rate risk are discussed below  while liquidity risk is discussed in the next subsection under the heading liquidity 
credit risk and allowance for loan losses inherent in any lending activity is credit risk  that is  the risk of loss should a borrower or trading counter party default 
credit risk is monitored and managed by a loan committee and a loss management committee 
credit quality and policies are major concerns of these committees 
we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment as recognized under fasb statement  accounting for contingencies 
the collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade 
another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under fasb statement  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the balance of these loans determined as impaired under fasb statement no 
and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments  unemployment rate in our market  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses was  and  at december  and  respectively 
we have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function 
adherence to these policies and procedures is mandated by management and the board of directors 
a number of committees and an underwriting staff oversee the lending operations of the company 
those include in house loan and loss management committees and a board of directors loan committee 
in addition  we maintain a loan review staff 
the underwriters review and score loan requests that are made by our lending staff 
in compliance with policy  the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience 
in addition  each lending officer s prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits 
before funds are advanced on consumer and commercial loans below certain dollar thresholds  loans are scored by the underwriters 
grades are assigned based on the scoring of the loans that are funded 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
loan requests of amounts greater than the officers lending limits are reviewed by an in house loan committee comprised of senior officers of the company 
decisions on funding loan requests are made or declined at this level provided they are within approved lending limits 
loan requests that exceed this group s lending authority are submitted to a loan committee comprised of members of the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is established after input from management  loan review  and the loss management committee 
an evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the types of loans  the credit risk in the portfolio  economic conditions and trends within each of these factors 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor 
grades are assigned by lending personnel based on the scoring of the loans that are funded 
loan grades range from to  with being loans with the least credit risk 
allowance factors established by management are applied to each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance factors are established based on our loss experience  adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios  as well as regulatory guidelines for criticized loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively for impairment 
for impaired loans  a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its estimated net realizable value 

table of contents a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for problem loans of or greater by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the ultimate collectibility of an impaired loan s principal is in doubt  wholly or partially  the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor and adjusts the loan credit grade accordingly 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
the allowance for loan losses is established after input from management  loan review  and the loss management committee 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is calculated quarterly  or more frequently if management deems it necessary 
these calculations are reviewed by management and the internal loan review staff 
foreclosure proceedings are initiated after all collection efforts have failed 
the collateral is purchased from the borrower at public auction for fair market value  with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price 
the purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance 
if the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds  the deficient balance is sent to the loan committee comprised of the board of directors for charge off approval 
these charge offs reduce the allowance for loan losses 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management increases the allowance by a charge to the provision for loan losses 
on a monthly basis  management and the board of directors review loan ratios 
these ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans  the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans  nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans 
in addition  management reviews past due ratios by officer  community bank  and company 
provision for loan losses to average loans the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is an amount which  in the judgment of management  is necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to meet the inherent risks of losses in our loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was   and  for   and  respectively 
factors considered in management s assessment for the periods presented include the risk rating of individual credits  the size and diversity of our loan portfolio  current trends in net charge offs  trends in non performing loans  trends in past due loans and current economic conditions in the markets in which we operate 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately  of commercial and commercial real estate loans for  one loan with a balance of was classified as nonperforming at the time it was sold 
the credit quality of the other loans  while not classified as nonperforming  had declined below our desired credit standards 
as such  we had established a reserve in the allowance for loan losses for the loans sold of  no gain or loss was recognized at the time of sale  although  we charged off  against the allowance for loan losses in connection with the sale of these loans 
existing reserves on these loans exceeded the amount charged off as a result of the sale by approximately the excess of the reserve in the allowance for loan losses over the amount charged off was reallocated to the remainder of the loan portfolio which reduced the provision for loan losses charged to operations during the fourth quarter of charge offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously through the provision for loan losses 
the net charge offs for and were  and  respectively 
the net charge off ratio for was 
and for was 
as discussed in the preceding paragraph  we sold approximately  of commercial and commercial real estate loans during the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of these loans  we charged off  this charge off represented of the total charge offs and 
of average loans for the year 

table of contents net charge offs for decreased by  or  from for  there was a significant decrease in all categories  with the largest decrease in the real estate mortgage sector in the amount of  or 
this improvement is attributed to the implementation of a more stringent loan review and evaluation process

generally  the accrual of income is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt  or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually days past due  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
management  the loss management committee  and our loan review staff closely monitor loans that are considered to be nonperforming 
restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition 
such concessions may include reduction in interest rates  or deferral of interest or principal payments 

table of contents the following table shows the principal amounts of nonperforming and restructured loans at december in thousands nonperforming loans nonaccruing accruing loans past due days or more total nonperforming loans restructured loans total nonperforming and restructured loans interest income foregone all loans where information exists about possible credit problems that would cause us to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with the current terms of the loan have been reflected within the table above 
approximately of the nonaccrual loans is attributable to one large credit relationship 
the relationship is secured by income producing real estate properties 
the company continues to closely monitor this credit and believes it has adequately reserved for any exposure as of december  the following table presents in thousands the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at december for each of the years presented

at december   no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans existed which were not disclosed as a separate category of loans 
interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities 
management believes the most significant impact on the company s financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure 
we have an asset liability committee alco  which is authorized by the board of directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to make decisions relating to that process 
the alco s goal is to structure our asset liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital 
profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value npv using rate shock analysis 
net interest income simulations measure the short term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest in a more rigorous and explicit fashion 
our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios 
the npv measures our long term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest 
npv is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time 
a decrease in npv due to a specified rate change indicates a decline in the long term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet 
the following rate shock analysis depicts the estimated impact on net interest income and npv of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december change in interest rates in basis points percentage change in net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 

table of contents the percentage change in this column represents our npv in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
the balance sheet structure as of december  indicates we are liability sensitive 
to mitigate our interest rate risk in the rising rate environment  we implemented a strategy of concentrating our loan growth in the form of variable products while extending the terms of the funding 
the results of the interest rate shock are within the limits set by the board of directors 
the above scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of and basis points 
recently  it has been the federal reserve board s policy to adjust the target federal funds rate over a period of time in basis point increments 
as interest rates are adjusted gradually over a period of time  we are able to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk 
the preceding measures assume no change in asset liability compositions 
thus  the measures do not reflect actions the alco may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates 
the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions 
these business assumptions are based upon our experience  business plans and published industry experience 
key assumptions employed in the model include asset prepayment speeds  the relative price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non maturity deposits 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  actual results will differ from simulated results 
the company enters into mortgage loan commitments with its customers 
under the mortgage loan commitments  interest rates for a mortgage loan may be locked into for up to thirty days with the customer 
once a mortgage loan commitment is entered into with a customer  the company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell such loan on a best efforts basis 
as such  the company does not incur risk if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close 
other than mortgage loan commitments  we have not entered into any other derivative activities 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
core deposits are a major source of funds used to meet cash flow needs 
maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to assuring liquidity 
when evaluating the movement of these funds  even during large interest rate changes  it is apparent that we continue to attract deposits that can be used to meet cash flow needs 
this is evidenced by our increase in core deposits during  even when our acquisition of renasant is excluded 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and potentially volatile liabilities ratios to ensure compliance with asset liability committee targets 
our security portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs 
these assets have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed 
within the next twelve months the securities available for sale portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow equal to of the carrying value of the total securities portfolio 
other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds purchased and advances from the fhlb 
interest is charged at the market federal funds rate on federal funds purchased and fhlb advances 
federal funds purchased at december  totaled  funds obtained from the fhlb are used primarily to match fund real estate loans in order to minimize interest rate risk  and may be used to meet day to day liquidity needs 
the total amount of remaining credit available to us from the fhlb was  as of december   our outstanding balance with the fhlb was  we also maintain lines of credits with other commercial banks totaling  these are unsecured lines of credit maturing at various times within the next twelve months 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credits 

table of contents at december   our total cost of funds  including noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  was  down from at december  noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts made up approximately of our average total deposits and borrowed funds at that date  comparable to at december  management targets growth of non interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing transaction accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts made up approximately of our funds and had an average cost of 
another significant source of funds was time deposits  making up of the total deposits with an average cost of for  compared to of the total with an average cost of at december  fhlb advances  typically used for clients who prefer longer term fixed rate loans  made up approximately of our average total deposits and borrowed funds with an average cost of 
our strategy in choosing funds is focused on attempting to mitigate interest rate risk  and thus we utilize funding sources that are commensurate with the interest rate risk associated with the assets 
accordingly  management targets growth of non interest bearing deposits 
while we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose  we do influence those choices with the rates we offer and with the deposit specials we offer 
for example  we mentioned that public funds may be readily obtained based on our aggressiveness in pricing 
we constantly monitor our funds position and evaluate the effect various funding sources have on our financial position 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december   compared to  at december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the same period of the primary contribution to this decrease was due to an increase of  in securities available for sale purchased in as compared to investment portfolio activity decreased as loan demand increased  resulting in a shift in earning asset types
