the company licenses its software to end users directly and also distributes its software products through license agreements with value added resellers  system integrators  original equipment manufacturers and other strategic partners 
revenues are generated from software licenses with customers and from the related sale of product maintenance  training and professional services 
additions to the number of authorized users  licenses issued for additional products and the renewal of product maintenance arrangements by customers pursuant to existing licenses also provide revenues to the company 
under software maintenance contracts  customers are typically entitled to receive telephone support  software bug fixes and upgrades or enhancements of particular software products when and if they are released 
the company believes retrievalware  its flagship product  has unique capabilities supporting the needs of customers within government agencies  as well as the media  entertainment and publishing sectors that will enable it to capitalize on current market opportunities and achieve its operational goals 
going forward  the company expects to focus a substantial amount of resources on further penetration of the national security  defense  law enforcement and intelligence gathering community with the united states and its allies 
an important objective in this market is to upgrade existing installations of older versions of retrievalware to the retrievalware platform that includes technical advancements such as categorization  dynamic classification  profiling and distributed indexing software capabilities 
further  the company expects to increase its efforts with regard to its web indexing initiative launched by the company during fiscal this research and development initiative is an advanced effort aimed at applying portions of the company s existing technology to searching and indexing contextually relevant information on the web 
the company has advanced the platform to a beta stage as of january  whereby the technology now contains more than billion documents in the index 
in concert with this initiative  convera has entered into a hosting facility agreement with at t in anticipation of a commercial launch of this service offering sometime during fiscal year the company will look to focus a majority of its selling and marketing efforts on the government and intelligence gathering community as well as the media  entertainment and publishing sector for the emerging web indexing technology

the company is committed to investing in the enhancement of its products to meet the needs of its customers and prospects 
to achieve its main objective  the company continually evaluates revenue opportunities to determine the market sectors in which the company should concentrate its sales and marketing efforts 
the company s business environment and the software industry in general are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  changes in customer requirements and emerging new market segments 
the company competes intensely within the commercial sector where its market position has not been as strong as it has been within the government sector 
as such  the company has elected to focus the majority of it efforts within the commercial setting on the media  entertainment and publishing sectors 
the company believes this segment may afford greater opportunities when compared to addressing a wide array of commercial market segments 
the company s competitors include many companies that are larger and more established and have substantially more resources 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
to address the competition  the company will continue to invest in research and development to advance its leadership position in linguistic analysis  scalability  performance  and taxonomy development and deployment 
the company will also make additional investments in specific product features to better serve the needs of customers looking for online customer service and support solutions

through a number of reorganizations during fiscal years through  the company aligned its resources in an effort to ensure it continued to capitalize on markets that have been consistently successful  including the federal government  and to focus more resources on those areas of the commercial business that present vertical market opportunities 
the reorganizations  which are described in this section and elsewhere in this form k  were intended to streamline the professional services  customer support and sales organizations by reducing the number of employees  improve the productivity of each of those organizations and reduce management personnel and other overhead costs in the marketing  development and administrative organizations within the company 
on august   the company announced that it further streamlined its expense structure 
as part of the restructuring  the company reduced its personnel related costs  eliminated certain marketing programs  renegotiated real estate obligations and decreased other general operating expenses

the december restructuring is expected to result in annualized savings of approximately million that will begin to be realized during the first quarter of fiscal the company recorded a net restructuring charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this effort 
management continually assesses historical results as well as future opportunities to determine whether resources are aligned appropriately 
where necessary  additional changes will be made to the organization to ensure that the company continues to focus on achieving profitable operating results for its core software products business 
with the expected reduction of approximately million in annualized expenses during fiscal  at historical revenue run rates  the core software products business is expected to be net income neutral for fiscal the company will continue to invest in its web indexing initiative  such that on a consolidated basis  the company is expected to remain in a net loss position until such time as the web indexing technology is offered to the commercial marketplace and certain levels of revenue are attained 
a detailed review of the numerous risks and challenges facing the company is contained in the forward looking statements section beginning on page critical accounting policies convera s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
convera does not have any material ownership interest in any entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the company 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases those estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring costs  income taxes and litigation  on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
convera believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition convera s recognition of revenues requires judgment  particularly in the areas of collectibility and whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time the sales are made 
the company bases its judgment on a variety of factors  including the payment and other terms of the individual customer contracts  credit history of the customer  prior dealings with specific customers  and certain other factors 
if the company determines that the price under the contract is fixed and determinable  and that collectibility is assured  then the company recognizes revenue related to the software license at the time of sale 
to the extent the company determines that the price of a sales agreement is not fixed  the company delays revenue recognition until payments under the contract become due 
alternatively  to the extent the company determines that the collection of payments under the contract is not assured  the company delays revenue recognition until the payments under the contract are received 
thus  the assessment as to whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time of sale and that the fees are collectible is critical in determining the extent of the revenue recognized in a given period 
the revenue associated with other elements of the contract  such as maintenance or training and professional services  are deferred and recognized as those elements are delivered 
generally  the company receives payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are non refundable 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
customization work is sometimes required to ensure that the company s software functionality meets the requirements of its customers 
in those instances where the company s revenues are generated from fixed price contracts related to this customization work  then revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these cost estimates underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
provision for doubtful accounts convera maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on an analysis of the company s historical collection experience and the company s portfolio of customers taking into consideration the general economic environment as well as the industry in which the company operates 
to the extent convera does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent convera does not accurately estimate its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets convera s acquisitions of other companies typically result in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
any goodwill resulting from such acquisitions is associated with the company s corporate reporting unit  since the company does not have multiple reporting units 
the impairment of goodwill is assessed on an annual basis or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value 
this assessment is performed by comparing the market value of the company s outstanding common stock with the carrying amount of the company s net assets 
if the market value exceeds the carrying amount of the company s net assets  impairment of goodwill does not exist 
if the market value is less than the carrying amount of the company s net assets  the company will perform further analysis and may be required to record an impairment 
the company evaluates all of its long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of the company s assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
deferred taxes convera records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of projected future taxable income 
if the estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in a benefit or a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
as of january   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  allows companies to account for stock based compensation either under the provisions of sfas no 
or under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as amended by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

the company has elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb stock options originally granted under the company s stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and accordingly no employee compensation cost related to the initial grant of options is included in expenses 
stock option modifications associated with a change in employee status to a nonemployee have been accounted for as a new award and measured using the intrinsic value method under apb  resulting in the inclusion of compensation expense in the january  consolidated statement of operations 
nonvested shares of stock referred to as deferred stock granted under the company s stock option plan are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company s common stock 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the corresponding service period 
if an employee leaves the company prior to the vesting of the deferred stock  the estimate of compensation expense recorded in previous periods is adjusted by decreasing compensation expense in the period of forfeiture

recent pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than august  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company is analyzing its options related to the adoption of statement r  which we will adopt as of august  as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were for the years ended january   and in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas no 
 which requires a nonmonetary exchange of assets be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gain or loss  if the exchange meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable 
the commercial substance criterion is assessed by comparing the entity s expected cash flows immediately before and after the exchange 
this eliminates the similar productive assets exception  which accounts for the exchange of assets at book value with no recognition of gain or loss 
statement will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  in january and amended the interpretation in december fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
the main provisions of fin are effective in financial statements for periods ending after march  except for certain vie structures that had an earlier effective date 
the company does not have any vies and consequently this interpretation has not had an effect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally confined to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse effects of differing tax structures 
international revenues from ctil  the company s foreign sales subsidiary located in the united kingdom were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year international sales are made predominantly from the company s foreign subsidiary and are typically denominated in british pounds  euros or us dollars 
as of january   approximately and of total consolidated accounts receivable were denominated in british pounds and euros  respectively 
the majority of these receivables are due within days of the end of fiscal year  and all receivables are due within one year 
additionally  the company is exposed to potential foreign currency gains or losses resulting from intercompany accounts that are not of a long term nature 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of ctil are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
as of january   approximately and of the company s cash and cash equivalents were denominated in british pounds and euros  respectively 
cash equivalents consist of funds deposited in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist primarily of us government treasury bills and are carried at amortized cost 
the company also has a certificate of deposit for  which is pledged to collateralize a letter of credit required for a leased facility 
given the relatively short maturity periods of cash equivalents and short term investments  the cost of these investments approximates their fair values and the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited
