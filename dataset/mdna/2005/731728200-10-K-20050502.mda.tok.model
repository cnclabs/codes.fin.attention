overview the company is engaged in the research  development  manufacture and marketing of biotechnology based products for the human pharmaceutical market  and also manufactures bulk pharmaceutical intermediates for the worldwide veterinary pharmaceutical industry 
the company conducts its business operations through its subsidiaries  which operate as strategic business units dextran products and chemdex 
dextran products business the manufacture and sale of bulk quantities of dextran and derivative products for sale to large pharmaceutical companies throughout the world is conducted through a canadian subsidiary  dextran products 
in fiscal year management intends to continue its focus on the core businesses of dextran products that have historically been the backbone of the company 
opportunities to increase distribution chains for existing dextran products in certain overseas markets  such as india  china and russia are being explored by management 
expanding current market opportunities and the potential for new market penetration has led management to make plant refurbishments and the expansion of production capacity a priority for fiscal year with respect to dextran products operations 
research and development of the company s human pharmaceutical products is coordinated at the dextran products facility 
ushercell  the company s leading human pharmaceutical compound  is a high molecular weight cellulose sulphate envisioned for topical vaginal use primarily in the prevention of transmission of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases  as well as unplanned pregnancies 
multiple clinical trials have been completed  and additional trials have commenced or are being actively planned  to evaluate various aspects of the use of cellulose sulphate as a contraceptive gel with antiviral capabilities 
the company also intends to significantly explore the use of ushercell as a treatment for bacterial vaginosis bv  the most common vaginal disorder among reproductive age women 
if effective  bv treatment may present an opportunity for commercial viability of ushercell in advance of the completion of the much lengthier required testing for its use as an antiviral or contraceptive gel 
chemdex  vet labs and the joint venture business during approximately one month of the fiscal year  the company also engaged in the finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business through its united states subsidiary chemdex  which  in turn  conducted its operations through its subsidiary  vet labs 
on december   vet labs and sparhawk laboratories inc entered into a joint venture for the purpose of manufacturing and selling veterinary pharmaceutical products 
on january   the company  chemdex and vet labs entered into an asset purchase agreement with sparhawk pursuant to which the company agreed to sell its finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business  including substantially all of the assets of vet labs and its ownership interest in the joint venture  to sparhawk for  in cash 
the sale was completed on march  simultaneously with the closing  chemdex advanced  to sparhawk in exchange for an unsecured subordinated promissory note bearing interest at per annum and a warrant to purchase of the equity of sparhawk 
the promissory note is payable in full on march  interest is payable annually  but can be deferred and added to the principal balance of the promissory note each year at sparhawk s discretion 
the warrant becomes exercisable on march  and expires at the earlier of payment in full of the promissory note or march  chemdex also entered into a supply agreement with sparhawk to supply ferric hydroxide and hydrogenated dextran solution to sparhawk on an exclusive basis in the united states for years 
in connection with the sale  the litigation involving the joint venture  sparhawk laboratories  inc v 
veterinary laboratories  inc  et al  case no 
cv  county of johnson  state of kansas  was settled  and a motion of approval of settlement and stipulation of dismissal with prejudice was filed with the court on march  management considered the finished goods veterinary pharmaceuticals industry to be a highly competitive  mature industry  and believed that meaningful growth in this industry would require significant investment in new product development 
the company s investment in this industry through the joint venture required the sharing of profits with its partner 
management believed that the company could expect to obtain a higher return on investment by focusing on its current dextran products business and on human pharmaceutical research and development projects 
the sale of this business segment resulted in a significant reduction in consolidated sales and gross profits during fiscal year results of operations fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  fy fy fy net income loss earnings loss per share the fiscal year increase in net income is attributable to the gain on sale of the vet labs assets 
this gain is partially offset by an increased tax provision 
the fiscal year reduction in net loss is attributable to the recovery of income tax expense 
in fiscal year  there was a recovery of income taxes of  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  in fiscal year  due to the recognition of the tax benefit of the non operating losses at chemdex  as described below 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year significantly exceeded income before income taxes because of the losses incurred at the company level in the bahamas  for which no tax recovery is available  and because a full valuation allowance was taken against the deferred tax assets relating to non operating losses at chemdex 
income loss before income taxes fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated dextran products chemdex the fiscal year improvement in operating results is primarily attributable to the gain on sale of the vet labs assets at chemdex and the reduction in the foreign exchange loss at dextran products 
the fiscal year decline in operating results is primarily attributable to the large foreign exchange loss and gross margin decline at dextran products due to the decline in the united states dollar relative to the canadian dollar 
the united states dollar continued to decline in value relative to the canadian dollar during fiscal year  which negatively affected gross margins at dextran products  since the majority of its revenue is denominated in united states dollars while the majority of its cost of sales is denominated in canadian dollars 
therefore  if the value of the canadian dollar increases in relation to the united states dollar  margins decrease 
exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a decrease in margins at dextran products in fiscal year dextran products realized a foreign exchange gain in fiscal year because it has a net liability exposure to the united states dollar 
during fiscal year  dextran products had a significant net asset exposure to the united states dollar because the majority of its accounts receivable balance and intercompany receivables were denominated in united states dollars  while the majority of its liabilities and expenses are in canadian dollars 
during march  chemdex repaid its intercompany debt to dextran products and advanced additional funds to dextran products 
dextran products 
the fiscal year increase in income before income taxes is primarily a result of the foreign exchange gain described above 
in addition  there is an increase in investment income because of the purchase of marketable securities 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the fiscal year decrease in income before income taxes is a result of the rise in the value of the canadian dollar  which resulted in the decrease in profit margins described above  as well as an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which are stated in united states dollars  and a foreign exchange loss 
chemdex 
the fiscal year increase in income before income taxes is due to the gain on the sale of the vet labs assets 
since march   the only operations for chemdex have been the supply of raw materials to sparhawk 
the fiscal year decrease in loss before income taxes is a result of the increase in sales and profit margins 
fiscal years sales fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated dextran products percentage of company sales chemdex percentage of company sales the significant decrease in sales during fiscal year is due to the sale of the vet labs business on march  this business represented virtually all of the chemdex operating segment 
the majority of the fiscal year sales increase was attributable to the chemdex operating segment 
dextran products 
demand for dextran and related products increased in both fiscal year and fiscal year due primarily to favorable pricing 
since dextran products pricing of product is primarily denominated in united states dollars  the decline in value of the united states dollar relative to the euro resulted in lower pricing for european agents  increasing demand for the products of dextran products 
management expects sales levels to increase slightly in fiscal year due to increased sales in europe  absent a significant rise in the value of the united states dollar 
chemdex 
as described above  the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business was sold on march  resulting in the significant decline in sales for this operating segment 
under a supply agreement with sparhawk  chemdex continues to supply raw materials for the manufacture of bulk iron dextran by sparhawk 
the introduction of three new products in the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business accounted for  of the fiscal year sales increase 
fiscal years gross profit fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated percentage of sales dextran products percentage of sales chemdex percentage of sales the fiscal year decrease in gross profit resulted from the decrease in sales from the chemdex operating segment due to the sale of the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business 
the increase in gross profit percentage is a result of the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business being a lower margin business than the dextran products operating segment 
the fiscal year increase in gross profit resulted from increased sales at the chemdex operating segment 
the concurrent decline in gross profit percentage is primarily due to declines at the dextran products operating segment due to exchange rate fluctuations  which caused a decrease in margins 
dextran products 
dextran products fiscal year and gross profit decrease was due to the significant rise in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar over the two year period 
the majority of dextran products costs are incurred in canadian dollars  while the majority of its sales are in united states dollars 
therefore  as the value of the canadian dollar rises in relation to the united states dollar  dextran products margins decrease 
exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a and an decrease in margins at dextran products in fiscal years and  respectively 
excluding the impact of exchange rates  dextran products realized an increase in margins during fiscal year due to cost control measures over materials and increased productivity 
a modest price increase for certain products also occurred at dextran products in fiscal year chemdex 
in fiscal year  chemdex operations consist of approximately one month of results from the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business 
the fiscal year increase in gross profit and margin at chemdex was primarily attributable to the increased sales levels  particularly in the high margin injectables product line  which resulted in lower average fixed costs 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses the fiscal year decrease in selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses is a result of the sale of the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business in march  the dextran products operating segment experienced an increase in selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year these costs were incurred in canadian dollars  resulting in increased expenses upon translation to united states dollars due to the significant rise in the canadian dollar as discussed above 
the fiscal year increase in selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses is a result of three main factors 
the cost of the company s director and officer liability insurance increased by as compared to fiscal year  due to general market conditions 
the company has not made a claim under any director and officer liability policy 
management salaries at chemdex also included a full year of salary for the general manager who was hired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year finally  the selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses incurred at dextran products were incurred in canadian dollars  resulting in increased expenses upon translation to united states dollars due to the significant rise in the canadian dollar as discussed above 
research and development fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease research and development expenditures investment tax credits net research and development expense as expected  the company s research and development expenditures increased in fiscal year due to additional product development activities performed by the company and funded outside of its partnership relationships 
the majority of this increase related to funding of the commencement of a pilot clinical study on the use of cellulose sulphate for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis 
this clinical study is related to an alternate use of cellulose sulphate and therefore is outside the scope of funding provided by the company s research and development partners for the investigation of this product as a contraceptive gel with antiviral properties 
the current stage of the cellulose sulphate project is such that a lesser portion of development is being performed in house and significant funding from research and development partners for the current phase of the project is expected to continue at necessary levels for the foreseeable future 
the company s research and development expenditures are expected to increase in fiscal year due to additional product development activities the company expects to perform and fund outside of its partnership relationships 
funding for the company s primary development products is provided directly by third party public and or private sector groups to the entities carrying out such research 
the company does not take possession or control over these funds 
the company benefits from the results of research projects through the ownership of patents and or licenses with respect to the products involved 
the company has no commitments to repay the funding or to purchase the results of the research 
due to continued direct funding of research and development expenses by third party public and or private sector groups  as well as investment tax credits claimed by dextran products  the company s research and development expense decreased in fiscal year fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease depreciation and amortization expense the fiscal year decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the sale of the finished goods veterinary pharmaceutical business in march the fiscal year increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily attributable to new production equipment purchased during fiscal year at dextran products and the increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease interest expense the decrease in interest expense in fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease in long term debt  as well as the associated decrease in imputed interest due to the continuing repayment of non interest bearing long term debt 
the share value guarantee payable was paid in full on march  when the joint venture operations were sold 
the fiscal year decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in long term debt  as well as the associated decrease in imputed interest due to the continuing repayment of non interest bearing long term debt 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease foreign exchange gain loss the increase in foreign exchange gain at dextran products in fiscal year was due to the significant decline in dextran products net exposure to the united states dollar 
dextran products has a net liability exposure to the united states dollar because intercompany payables denominated in united states dollars exceed its united states dollar denominated accounts receivable balance 
dextran products realized a foreign exchange gain in fiscal because the canadian dollar increased in value relative to the united states dollar 
during fiscal year  dextran products had large intercompany receivables denominated in united states dollars  and experienced a foreign exchange loss in fiscal year because the value of the canadian dollar increased relative to the united states dollar 
a large portion of these intercompany receivables were repaid in march when the joint venture operations were sold 
as compared to fiscal year  management does not expect that the company will incur significant foreign exchange losses in fiscal year fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease other income expense in fiscal year  the company earned interest income of  from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the vet labs assets 
in fiscal year  the other expenses relate almost entirely to legal and receiver costs associated with the winding up of the joint venture  and the resulting litigation 
in fiscal year  legal and receiver fees relating to this process totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year additionally  due to the uncertainty related to this situation  in fiscal year  the company provided an allowance for the entire receivable balances of  due from sparhawk 
fiscal years tax provision recovery fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated dextran products chemdex the fiscal year decrease in tax provision at dextran products is a result of a decrease in deferred tax liabilities 
the fiscal year decrease in tax provision at dextran products is a result of the decrease in profitability in fiscal year as described above 
the tax provision at dextran products exceeded its income before taxes because a significant portion of the foreign exchange loss is related to intercompany financing and consequently is deductible only against capital gains 
the canadian operations continue to have significant research and development tax pools to offset current taxes payable 
the fiscal year tax provision at chemdex is a result of the gain recognized on the sale of the vet labs assets 
the fiscal year chemdex tax benefit was recorded because there was no longer uncertainty as to the ability of chemdex to use non operating losses following the sale of the vet labs assets for a gain subsequent to the end of fiscal year liquidity and capital resources as of january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to cash of  at january  in fiscal year  the company used cash of  in its operating activities  compared to generating cash from operations of  for fiscal year although there was a significant increase in net income in fiscal year  this increase resulted from the gain on sale of the finished products veterinary pharmaceutical business  which proceeds are classified as an investing activity 
the decrease in cash generated from operations in fiscal year as compared to cash generated in fiscal year is because of the decrease in earnings when the gain on sale of the finished products veterinary pharmaceutical business is removed 
the cash generated from operations in fiscal year was less than that generated in fiscal year  even though the net loss was significantly less in fiscal year  because the reduction in the net loss resulted from the deferred tax recovery  which was a non cash item 
there were significant non cash expenses relating to deferred income taxes and the writedown of loan to sparhawk  in fiscal year  which were not incurred in fiscal year depreciation and amortization continues to be a large non cash expense of the company 
the company maintained  of working capital and a current ratio of to as of january   compared to  and to as of january   and  and to as of january  management expects the primary source of its future capital needs to be a combination of existing cash and cash equivalent reserves generated from the sale of the vet labs assets  company earnings and borrowings 
the company  at present  does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  although management intends to continue the plant refurbishment process at dextran products in toronto 
the company believes that based upon the current levels of revenues and spending  its existing working capital resources will be sufficient to support continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
at january   the company had accounts receivable of  and inventory of  compared to  and  respectively  at january  the january  balances included amounts classified as assets subject to sale agreement  which represented amounts for the finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business 
the decrease in both accounts receivable and in inventory levels is due to the sale of the vet labs assets in march at january   the company had accounts receivable of  and inventory of  the decrease in accounts receivable from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to the timing of collections at year end  while the increase in inventory levels was due to the stocking of new products at chemdex 
at january   the company had accounts payable of  compared to  at january  the january  balance included amounts classified as liabilities subject to sale agreement  which represented amounts for the finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business 
the decrease in accounts payable levels is due to the sale of the vet labs assets in march at january   the company had accounts payable of  with the decrease between fiscal year and fiscal year due primarily to timing of supplier payments 
during fiscal year  capital expenditures totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the majority of the capital expenditures were for production equipment at the dextran products plant in toronto in these fiscal years 
management intends to continue its plant refurbishment and expansion plan in fiscal year  and expects capital expenditures to increase in that period 
during fiscal year  the company invested a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business in medium term  investment grade  debt securities denominated in canadian dollars 
these securities have maturities ranging from december  to june  unrealized gains and losses will occur as the market interest rate varies 
management does not expect significant gains or losses in the future due to the relatively short term to maturity of the debt securities 
management plans to hold these debt securities to maturity unless such funds are needed for working capital or other cash needs 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of the company is almost entirely attributable to the currency translation adjustment of dextran products 
dextran products functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this currency translation adjustment arises from the translation of dextran products financial statements to us dollars 
dextran products has a cdn 
 us  line of credit  of which cdn 
 us  was utilized at january  at january   cdn 
 us  of the line of credit was utilized 
this line of credit bears interest at the canadian banks prime lending rate plus  
this indebtedness is collateralized by a general security agreement over the company s assets and a collateral mortgage of cdn 
 on the dextran products building in toronto 
the significant decrease in long term debt from fiscal year to fiscal year is due to the full repayment of the share value guarantee on march  the majority of the long term debt is due in the next fiscal year 
dextran products entered into one new long term debt obligation during fiscal year  which related to the buyout of a piece of office equipment 
chemdex entered into a long term debt obligation on september   which related to the redemption of the minority interest in chemdex 
the redemption amount was  which is to be paid in equal monthly installments of  commencing on the redemption date 
since this installment contract is non interest bearing  it has been discounted using a discount rate of 
the present value of this installment contract is  which has been recorded as long term debt 
the company entered into one new capital lease obligation at dextran products during fiscal year  for a piece of office equipment 
capital lease obligations are due over the next five years  the majority of which are due in the next two years 
no changes in accounting principles or their application have been implemented in the reporting period that would have a material effect on reported income 
changes in the relative values of the canadian dollar and the united states dollar occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company does not believe that the impact of inflation and changing prices has had a material effect on its operations or financial results at any time in the last three years

risk factors the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
the company s product development efforts may be reduced or discontinued due to difficulties or delays in clinical trials 
to achieve sustained profitability  the company must  alone or with corporate partners and collaborators  successfully research  develop and commercialize identified technologies or product candidates 
current developmental product candidates are in various stages of clinical and pre clinical development and will require significant further funding  research  development  preclinical and or clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization testing  and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative or novel technologies 
these products are also rigorously regulated by the us federal government  particularly the fda  and by comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries 
specifically  each of the following results is possible with respect to any one of the company s developmental product candidates that the company will not be able to maintain its current research and development schedules  that the company will not be able to enter into human clinical trials because of scientific  governmental or financial reasons  or that it will encounter problems in clinical trials that will cause a delay or suspension of the development of the product candidate  that the developmental product will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  that government regulations will delay or prevent the product s marketing for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon the company s activities  that the fda or other regulatory agencies will not approve the product or the process by which the product is manufactured  or will not do so on a timely basis  and or that the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations and policies may be instituted  which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the product 
if any of the risks set forth above occurs  the company may not be able to successfully develop its identified developmental product candidates 
the company s developmental product commercialization efforts may not be successful 
it is possible that  for reasons including  but not limited to those set forth below  the company may be unable to commercialize or receive royalties from the sale of any given developmental product  even if it is shown to be effective  if the product is uneconomical or if the market for the product does not develop or diminishes  the company is not able to enter into arrangements or collaborations to commercialize and or market the product  the product is not eligible for third party reimbursement from government or private insurers  others hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from commercializing the product  others have brought to market similar or superior products  others have superior resources to market similar products or technologies  government regulation imposes limitations on the indicated uses of the product  or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product results in added restrictions on the product or results in the product being withdrawn from the market  and or the product has undesirable or unintended side effects that prevent or limit its commercial use 
the company depends on partnerships with third parties for the development and commercialization of its products 
the company s strategy for development and commercialization of its products is to rely on licensing agreements with third party partners 
as a result  the ability of the company to commercialize future products is dependent upon the success of third parties in performing clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and successfully marketing its products 
there can be no assurance that such third party collaborations will be successful 
if any of the company s current research and development partnerships are discontinued  it may not be able to find others to develop and commercialize its current product candidates 
the company does not currently have agreements with third parties to market its developmental products 
the commercialization of any of the company s developmental products that receive fda approval will depend upon the company s ability to enter into agreements with companies that have sales and marketing capabilities 
the company currently intends to sell its products in the united states and internationally in collaboration with one or more marketing partners 
the company may not be able to enter into any such collaboration to market its developmental products in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the company may be unable to commercialize its products if it is unable to protect its proprietary rights  and may be liable for significant costs and damages if it faces a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
in the absence of patent and trade secret protection  competitors may adversely affect the company s business by independently developing and marketing substantially equivalent or superior products  possibly at lower prices 
the company could also incur substantial costs in litigation and suffer diversion of attention of technical and management personnel if it is required to defend intellectual property infringement suits brought by third parties  with or without merit  or if required to initiate litigation against others to protect or assert intellectual property rights 
moreover  any such litigation may not be resolved in favor of the company 
the company has received various patents covering the uses of its developmental products 
however  the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions  and recently has been the subject of much litigation 
any patents the company has obtained  or may obtain in the future  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
to date  no consistent policy has been developed by the united states patent and trademark office regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and because publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  the company cannot be certain that it and its licensors are the first creators of inventions covered by any licensed patent applications or patents or that the company or such licensors are the first to file 
the united states patent and trademark office may commence interference proceedings involving patents or patent applications  in which the question of first inventorship is contested 
accordingly  the patents owned by or licensed to the company may not be valid or may not afford the company protection against competitors with similar intellectual property 
it is also possible that the company s patents may infringe on patents or other rights owned by others  licenses to which may not be available to the company 
the company may have to alter its products or processes  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities altogether because of patent rights of third parties 
in addition to the products for which the company has patents or have filed patent applications  the company relies upon unpatented proprietary technology and may not be able to meaningfully protect its rights with regard to that unpatented proprietary technology 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  applied on a consistent basis 
the critical accounting policies include the use of estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts  the useful lives of assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the company s accounting policies with respect to the joint venture and its disposition are also discussed below 
management is required to make estimates and assumptions  in preparing the consolidated financial statements  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
the actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates made by management include the calculation of reserves for uncollectible accounts  inventory allowances  useful lives of long lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition all revenue is from sales of bulk and finished dosage manufactured products and is recognized when title and risk of ownership of products pass to the customer 
title and risk of ownership pass to the customer pursuant to the applicable sales contract  either upon shipment of product or upon receipt by the customer 
since returns are rare and generally not accepted  management has not made provision for returns 
in addition  product sold in bulk quantities is tested  prior to release for shipment  to ensure that it meets customer specifications  and in many cases  customers receive samples for their own testing 
approval is obtained from the customer prior to shipping 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by each reporting unit on a specific item basis 
management reviews the credit worthiness of individual customers and past payment history to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
since the majority of sales at dextran products are export  dextran products maintains credit insurance through a crown corporation for the majority of its customers receivables 
there has been no allowance for doubtful accounts during the past three years 
long lived assets long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation or amortization computed using the straight line method based on their estimated useful lives ranging from three to fifteen years 
useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to the company s cash flows 
a significant change in estimated useful lives could have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  including buildings  equipment and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on the company s ability to recoverthe carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted andwithout interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than thecarrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference betweenestimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management tomake estimates of these cash flows related to long lived assets as well as other fair valuedeterminations 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where there is uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of the future tax deduction 
dextran products has incurred capital losses  which are only deductible against capital gains 
it is not certain that dextran products will realize capital gains in the future to use these canadian capital loss deductions 
the joint venture in  vet labs and sparhawk entered into the joint venture for the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceutical products
