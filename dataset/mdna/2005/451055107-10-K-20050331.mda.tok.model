general introduction in december   the board of directors of the company approved a change in the company s fiscal year end from january to december  effective for the period ending december  as a result  the month current year has been reported as an eleven month period 
the month period from february  through january  was the company s fiscal in may  the company changed its business model by licensing its footwear operations pursuant to the footwear licenses and in june it entered into the jeans wear license  effective august   thereby  respectively  transitioning the company s operations as they related to the production and distribution of women s and girl s footwear and jeans wear 
in december  the company  through iph  entered into the kohl s license 
as a result of this change in the footwear operations of the company  the company is now a marketing and licensing company that focuses on licensing and marketing its brands 
see item new business model trademarks and licensing 
the company also markets and sells  principally as an agent  a variety of men s outdoor boots and casual shoes under private label brands through bright star 
on october  the closing date  the company acquired the principal assets the purchased assets of bem  the holding company for the designer business badgley mischka from parent company escada usa the purchased assets include the badgley mischka trademark  two existing licenses and the rights to operate the existing badgley mischka retail store located on rodeo drive in beverly hills  california 
the purchase price for the transaction was  excluding  of fees and expenses related to the acquisition which was paid by the company s issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
the purchase price of the purchased assets is subject to an upward adjustment in the event that the closing sale price of the company s common stock on the date which is days after the closing date is less than the closing sale price on the closing date 
any such adjustment will also be paid in shares of the company s common stock 
the company filed a registration statement with the sec for the resale of the  shares of the company s common stock issued to bem 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on december  as a result of the company s transition to a licensing business  and to a lesser extent  its change in fiscal year end  the company s operating results are not comparable to prior years 
further  since there are no net sales attributable to women s wholesale and retail footwear activities in the month current year and it is anticipated that there will be none thereafter  the results for the month current year and the year ending december  are also expected to be non comparable to prior years 
critical accounting policies during the month current year  the company adopted certain new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  as described below and summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in the month current year 
several of the company s accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for the collectibility of accounts receivable and the recovery value of inventory 
for accounts receivable  the company estimates the net collectibility considering historical  current and anticipated trends of co op advertising deductions  operational deductions taken by customers  markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of customers 
for inventory  the company estimates the amount of goods that it will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and writes down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through price reductions and close outs 
of the consolidated group  only unzipped  was subject to inventory risk 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
revenue during the month current year relating to unzipped and bright star  was recognized upon shipment with related risk and title passing to the customers 
estimates of losses for bad debts  returns and other allowances were recorded at the time of the sale 
in connection with its new licensing model  the company has entered into various trade name license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon the company s adoption of sfas no 
on february   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under sfas no 
 the company had goodwill tested for impairment during the month current year  fiscal and  and no impairments were necessary 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

other 
the company s cash requirements fluctuate from time to time due to  among other factors  seasonal requirements  including the timing of receipt of merchandise 
the company believes that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements for the foreseeable future  primarily with cash flow from operations 
however  if the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be incorrect  it could be required to obtain additional capital that may not be available to it on acceptable terms  or at all 
the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of december   and is based on information appearing in the notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in thousands contractual obligations total after notes payable bank long term debt      operating leases total contractual cash obligations      seasonality the company s quarterly results may fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of its licensees businesses as well as a result of holidays  weather  the timing of product shipments  market acceptance of company products  the mix  pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold  the hiring and training of personnel  the timing of inventory write downs  fluctuations in the cost of materials  the mix between wholesale and licensing businesses  and the incurrence of operating costs beyond the company s control as may be caused general economic conditions  and other unpredictable factors such as the action of competitors 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  the timing of the receipt of future revenues could be impacted by the recent trend among retailers in the company s industry to order goods closer to a particular selling season than they have historically done so 
the company continues to seek to expand and diversify its product lines under license to help reduce the dependence on any particular product line and lessen the impact of the seasonal nature of its business 
the success of the company  however  will still largely remain dependent on its and its licensees ability to contract with and retain key licensees  to predict accurately upcoming fashion trends among its customer base  to build and maintain brand awareness and to fulfill the product requirements of the retail channel within the shortened timeframe required 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the united states economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  among other factors noted in this report  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s products are marketed primarily for fall and spring seasons  with slightly higher volumes of products sold during the second fiscal quarter 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
net operating loss carry forwards at december   the company had available net operating losses nol of approximately million for income tax purposes  which expire in the years through because of ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code occurring in previous fiscal years  the utilization of approximately million of the net operating losses is limited to  per year and expires in the years through the remaining million is not subject to such limitation and expires through included in the nol is million as of december  from the exercises of stock options  the benefit of the utilization of this nol will go into additional paid in capital
