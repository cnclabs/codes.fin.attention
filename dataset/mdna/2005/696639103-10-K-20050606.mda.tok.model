item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations further explains the impacts of these conditions on our operating results 
factory built operations our factory built operations consist of the production and sale of manufactured homes and modular homes 
our manufactured homes are constructed in accordance with the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards hud regulations 
approximately of the homes we produced in fiscal were built to hud regulations 
the remaining of homes we produced were modular homes  which are built in accordance with state or local building codes 
the following table sets forth the total factory built homes sold as well as the number of manufacturing facilities we operated for the fiscal years indicated factory built homes sold single section multi section modular total factory built homes sold operating manufacturing facilities at end of fiscal year the principal materials used in the production of our factory built homes include wood  wood products  gypsum wallboard  steel  fiberglass insulation  carpet  vinyl  fasteners  appliances  electrical items  windows and doors 
we believe that the materials used in the production of our factory built homes are readily available from a wide variety of suppliers and the loss of any single supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
the three suppliers which accounted for more than of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended march  represented  and  respectively  of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended march  prices of certain materials such as lumber  gypsum  steel and 
table of contents insulation can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand 
although we and others in the industry typically have been able to pass higher material costs on to the consumer through price increases  such increases typically lag the escalation of materials costs 
no assurances can be made that we will be able to pass these costs on in future years 
manufactured homes we manufacture single and multi section manufactured homes under various brand names including palm harbor tm  masterpiece tm  keystone tm  countryplace  river bend and windsor homes tm 
approximately of the manufactured homes we produced were multi section in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we offer over floor plans  ranging in size from approximately to  square feet 
approximately of the manufactured homes we produce are structurally or decoratively customized to the homebuyer s specifications 
although we produce a wide price range of manufactured homes  the average retail sales price excluding land of our manufactured homes was approximately  during fiscal our homes are manufactured in indoor facilities  which have approximately  square feet of floor space and employ an average of associates who generally work one shift per day  five days per week 
construction of our homes is performed in stages using an assembly line process 
each section is permanently attached to a steel support chassis  various components such as floors  interior and exterior walls and a roof are added and function testing is performed 
we currently manufacture a typical manufactured home in approximately five days 
our facilities have the capacity to produce an aggregate of approximately sections per day 
the current rate of production is our typical manufactured home contains two to five bedrooms  a living room  family room  dining room  kitchen  two or three bathrooms and features central air conditioning and heating  a range  refrigerator  carpeting and drapes 
in addition  we offer optional amenities  including dishwashers  washers  dryers  furniture packages and specialty cabinets  as well as a wide range of colors  moldings and finishes 
optional features usually associated with site built homes such as stone fireplaces  ceramic tile floors  showers and countertops  computer rooms  skylights  vaulted ceilings and whirlpool baths are also offered 
we have a unique package of energy saving construction features referred to as energmiser tm which includes  among other things  additional insulation to reduce heating and cooling costs  and which exceeds statutorily mandated energy efficiency levels 
we are constantly introducing new floor plans  decors  exteriors  features and accessories to appeal to different regions of the country and changing trends 
our manufactured homes are designed and copyrighted after extensive field research and consumer feedback 
we have developed engineering systems which  through the use of computer aided technology  permit customization of homes and assist with product development and enhancement 
the completed manufactured homes are transported by independent trucking companies to either the retail sales center or to the customer s site 
the transportation cost is borne by the independent retailer 
retailers or other independent installers are responsible for placing the manufactured home on site  joining the interior and exterior seams  making utility hook ups and  in certain instances  providing installation and finish out services 
the industry practice is to have third parties hired by the retailer provide the installation and finish out services 
our associates  rather than third parties  perform the installation and finish out services on manufactured homes sold 
we believe our finish out services ensure that our quality procedures are applied during the entire process and increase customer satisfaction  thereby providing us a competitive advantage 
our backlog of manufactured housing orders as of june  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of april  since retailers may cancel orders prior to production without penalty  we do not consider our order backlog to be firm orders  however  such cancellations rarely occur 
because of the seasonality of the manufactured housing market  the level of backlog generally declines during the winter months 

table of contents modular homes we manufacture modular homes through our wholly owned subsidiary  nationwide custom homes  inc nationwide operates three facilities in martinsville  virginia  one in arabi  georgia  and one in siler city  north carolina 
in addition  eight of our other manufacturing facilities produce modular homes principally under the brand name discovery custom homes 
we produce a wide price range of modular homes with an average retail sales price excluding land of  for fiscal our modular homes include single story ranch homes  split levels  cape cods and two and three story homes 
like a manufactured home  a typical modular home contains the standard rooms and features and offers optional amenities  decors  exteriors and floor plans 
each modular home is assembled in sections 
the process begins on a production line where a team of assemblers creates the floor and walls of the house 
the section is then wheeled down a tracked path where various stages of finish are performed and components are added from wiring and insulation early in the process to fixtures and floor coverings just prior to shipping 
modular homes are typically completed in one to two weeks 
the homes are shipped directly off the manufacturing line to the customer s site 
once on site  the homes are typically crane set on the foundation  the roof is raised and the final seam of roof shingles along the ridges of the roofline is applied 
our backlog of orders at nationwide as of june   was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of april  retail our homes are sold through a distribution network consisting of retail superstores we own and independent dealers  builders and developers 
we had a shift in our distribution network from to to of our homes being sold by our company owned superstores and builder locations from fiscal to fiscal to fiscal  respectively 
this decrease in the percentage of homes we manufactured and sold through our company owned superstores and builder locations has resulted in a decline of gross margins from to to from fiscal to fiscal to fiscal  respectively 
the following table sets forth the number of homes we sold through each of these distribution channels  as well as the number of company owned retail superstores and independent dealers  builders and developers during the past three fiscal years march  march  march  factory built homes sold by company owned superstores and builder locations independent dealers  builders and developers total number of company owned superstores and builder locations independent dealers  builders and developers total we first established company owned retail superstores in and currently have superstores in states 
one of our typical retail superstores consists of a sales office  which is a manufactured home  and a variety of factory built model homes of various sizes  floor plans  features and prices 
currently  of our retail superstores have modular model homes on site and many of our retail superstores also sell used and repossessed homes 
customers may purchase one of the model homes or may order a home that will be built at one of our manufacturing facilities and customized to meet their needs 

table of contents through nationwide  we have four builder locations in virginia and north carolina 
our typical builder location consists of a modular model home which serves as a sales office 
our independent retailer network principally consists of local dealers and builders that market land home packages and developers of communities 
no single independent retailer accounted for or more of our net sales during fiscal  or independent builders developers approximately of the modular homes we sold in fiscal were sold from our five nationwide manufacturing facilities directly to a consumer 
nationwide s independent distribution network consists of approximately local builders and developers with whom we have developed relationships through direct marketing  trade shows  the internet and referrals 
nationwide transports the home to the builder s developer s site and the builder developer contracts crews to lift the home with a crane onto its foundation and subsequently perform the finish out services 
modular homes typically require a larger amount of work to be done on site to complete the production of the homes 
currently eight of our manufactured housing facilities also build modular homes and sell homes directly to builders developers 
markets served during the fiscal year ended march   the percentage of our revenues by region was as follows percentage of region primary states revenue by region southeast florida  north carolina  alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  tennessee  virginia  west virginia  maryland  connecticut  delaware central texas  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana west new mexico  arizona  california  colorado  oregon  washington  montana  nevada  idaho midwest ohio  michigan  indiana  kentucky  illinois  pennsylvania  missouri the two states which accounted for greater than of our revenues were florida and texas with and  respectively  of total revenues 
factory built housing  which consists of manufactured housing and modular housing  is a regional business and the primary geographic market is within a mile radius for a manufactured housing facility and within a one to two day drive for a modular housing facility 
each of our manufactured housing facilities typically serves to retailers  and the facility sales staff maintains personal contact with each retailer  whether company owned or independent 
our decentralized operations allow us to be more responsive in addressing regional customer preferences of product innovation and home design 
consumer financing we maintain relationships with conventional lenders who provide two basic types of consumer financing in the manufactured housing industry chattel or personal property loans for purchasers of a home with no real estate involved and land home or mortgage loans which finance the land  home and all improvements on the property 
there are two types of mortgage loans conforming and non conforming 
conforming loans conform to fha  va  freddie mac and fannie mae standards 
generally  the type of required foundations installed must conform to federal requirements and the borrower must meet certain criteria 
non conforming loans are financed by a major bank or lending institution which does not require a specific foundation type and have more flexible criteria 
beginning in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  many consumer 
table of contents lenders have tightened credit underwriting standards which has resulted in reduced lending volumes and lower sales volumes of manufactured homes 
some of our customers obtain third party construction financing  which allows for progress payments to be made to us at periodic intervals during the manufacturing  sale and closing process 
this type of financing is primarily available to those customers obtaining land home or mortgage loans  which finance the land  home and improvements of a piece of real property 
such third party construction financing through our customers is generally more advantageous to us in that the cash is received earlier and can be used for various corporate purposes 
in addition  we provide financing to our customers on competitive terms through our owned subsidiary  countryplace  and our investment as the sole limited partner in bsm 
through countryplace  we offer customary chattel loans and non conforming land home mortgage loans for manufactured homes sold through our own retail superstores 
through bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgage financing for both modular and manufactured homes 
we believe that providing these financing alternatives to our customers improves our responsiveness to the financing needs of prospective purchasers and provides us with an additional source of earnings 
prior to the third quarter of  countryplace originated loans and immediately sold them to other lenders 
during the third quarter of  we executed our planned strategy and expanded countryplace into a full service chattel lender with originating  servicing and securitization capabilities 
countryplace originated million  million and million of loans for its own investment portfolio in fiscal  and  respectively 
countryplace services and collects its portfolio of loans using its own employees and systems 
insurance we offer property and casualty insurance as well as extended warranties for owners of manufactured homes through our subsidiary  standard casualty 
during fiscal  and of homeowners who purchased a home through our own retail superstores purchased property and casualty insurance and extended warranties  respectively 
at the end of fiscal  standard casualty had approximately  policies in force 
wholesale financing in accordance with manufactured housing industry practice  substantially all retailers finance a portion of their purchases of manufactured homes through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
under a typical floor plan financing arrangement  a financial institution provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral 
the financial institution which provides financing to the retailer customarily requires us to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution under which we are obligated  upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances  to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement which generally ranges from to months 
the price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon our original invoice price plus certain administrative and shipping expenses 
our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i only of our homes are sold to independent retailers  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent retailers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of retailers  v none of our independent retailers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
we estimate that our potential obligations under such repurchase agreements were approximately million as of march  during the fiscal years ended 
table of contents march   march  and march   we incurred net expenses under these repurchase agreements totaling   and  respectively 
beginning in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  lenient credit standards  which had facilitated increased industry wide wholesale shipments in previous years  tightened  resulting in declining wholesale shipments  declining margins and lower retail sales levels for most industry participants 
during this time  several major floor plan lenders have exited the wholesale financing business and a number of regional banks have entered the retail financing or increased their lending volumes 
competition the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels  with competition based upon several factors  including price  product features  reputation for service and quality  depth of field inventory  promotion  merchandising and the terms of retail customer financing 
in addition  manufactured and modular homes compete with new and existing site built homes  as well as apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
the efficiency of the assembly line process  protection from the weather and nationwide purchasing power enable us to produce a home in approximately one to two weeks and typically at a lower cost than a conventional site built home of similar quality 
we do not view any of our competitors as being dominant in the industry  although some of our competitors possess substantially greater manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources than us 
although many lenders to the manufactured housing industry have reduced their volume or gone out of business  there are still competitors to countryplace and bsm in the markets where we do business 
these competitors include national  regional and local banks  independent finance companies  mortgage brokers and mortgage banks 
none of these competitors is considered to be dominant or to have a material impact on the financing opportunities at countryplace or bsm 
business segment information we operate principally in two segments factory built housing  which includes manufactured housing  modular housing and retail operations and financial services  which includes finance and insurance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for information on our net sales  income loss from operations  identifiable assets  depreciation and amortization expense and capital expenditures by segment for fiscal  and government regulation our manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws  codes and regulations 
construction of manufactured housing is governed by the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of  as amended the home construction act 
in  the department of housing and urban development hud issued regulations under the home construction act establishing comprehensive national construction standards 
the hud regulations  known collectively as the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards  cover all aspects of manufactured home construction  including structural integrity  fire safety  wind loads  thermal protection and ventilation 
such regulations preempt conflicting state and local regulations on such matters  and are subject to continual change 
our manufacturing facilities and the plans and specifications of our manufactured homes have been approved by a hud certified inspection agency 
further  an independent hud certified third party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with the hud regulations during construction 
failure to comply with applicable hud regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions  including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities 
we believe our manufactured homes meet or surpass all present hud requirements 
our modular homes are subject to state and or local codes with certification and regulation and we believe our modular homes meet all state and or local codes 
manufactured and site built homes are all typically built with some products that contain formaldehyde resins 
since february  hud has regulated the allowable concentrations of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and requires manufacturers to warn purchasers as to formaldehyde 
table of contents associated risks 
the environmental protection agency and other governmental agencies have in the past evaluated the effects of formaldehyde 
we use materials in our manufactured homes that meet hud standards for formaldehyde emissions and believe we comply with hud and other applicable government regulations in this regard 
the transportation of factory built homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements 
our manufactured homes are subject to local zoning and housing regulations 
in certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold  local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities 
such ordinances and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect 
a number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes 
utility connections are subject to state and local regulation and must be complied with by the retailer or other person installing the home 
our modular homes are also subject to local zoning regulations which govern the placement of homes 
certain of our warranties may be subject to the magnuson moss warranty federal trade commission improvement act  which regulates the descriptions of warranties on products 
the description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations 
a number of states require manufactured home producers to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims 
a variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture 
the federal consumer credit protection act truth in lending and regulation z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing  including the amount of the annual percentage rate and the finance charge 
the federal fair credit reporting act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit 
the federal equal credit opportunity act and regulation b promulgated thereunder prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds 
the real estate settlement procedures act and regulation x promulgated thereunder require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
the federal trade commission has adopted or proposed various trade regulation rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers claims and defenses 
installment sales contracts eligible for inclusion in a government national mortgage association program are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the federal housing association 
a variety of state laws also regulate the form of the installment sale contracts or financing documents and the allowable deposits  finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to installment sale contracts or financing documents 
our sale of insurance products is subject to various state insurance laws and regulations which govern allowable charges and other insurance practices 
our operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations  and violations may result in the payment of fines  the entry of injunctions or both 
the requirements of such laws and enforcement policies have generally become more strict in recent years 
accordingly  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies

we market nationwide through vertically integrated operations  encompassing manufactured and modular housing  chattel and mortgage bank financing  as well as insurance 
as of march   we operated manufacturing facilities that sell homes through company owned retail superstores and builder locations and approximately independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
through our owned subsidiary  countryplace  we offer chattel and non conforming land home mortgages to purchasers of manufactured homes sold by company owned retail superstores 
through our investment as the sole limited partner in bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgages for both modular and manufactured homes 
we also provide property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured and modular homes through our wholly owned subsidiary  standard casualty 
during the first quarter  we completed a successful private offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that will be convertible into shares of palm harbor s common stock  subject to certain conditions and contingencies 
we have used the majority of the proceeds to reduce our floor plan payable to million at march  from million at march  the remainder of the proceeds has been used to help fund countryplace s operations and for general corporate purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
the second quarter of fiscal results were impacted by the hurricane activity on the east coast 
this created a number of disruptions for palm harbor and others in our industry with the resultant delays in both wholesale and retail deliveries 
also  retail demand has been slow to recover  especially in our key markets of texas and the carolinas  where we have a significant retail presence 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we streamlined our retail operations in order to improve our operating efficiencies 
additionally  we temporarily idled a production line in texas and shifted production to another plant 
furthermore  we closed of our least productive retail sales centers in order to more effectively align our resources with current demand in the market 
our results for the third quarter include million  or per share  for charges related to these decisions 
of the million in charges  million was recorded as a component of cost of sales and million as selling  general and administrative expenses offset by a million income tax benefit 
resulting cost reductions should approximate million after tax annually 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  we temporarily shifted production from one of our production lines to two other lines in order to create some operational efficiencies 
management will analyze this revised 
table of contents production schedule for a while and determine whether we should continue with the shift or open the production line back up 
we are focusing on increasing sales of our modular homes 
we sold more modular homes during fiscal as compared to fiscal and the number of modular homes sold was of total factory built homes sold in fiscal versus in fiscal our discovery series of modular homes account for about one quarter of total modular sales 
we believe that modular housing is a key driver of our future growth and profitability 
we continue to execute our strategy of expanding our consumer financing capabilities through our finance subsidiary  countryplace  and our partnership in bsm 
countryplace is now servicing  consumer chattel loans  totaling million 
during fiscal  bsm originated  loans  of which were for palm harbor customers 
for fiscal  approximately of our retail customers were financed by either countryplace or bsm 
the largest impediment of our growth is financing for our retail customers which  if limited  could affect our sales volume 
additionally  obtaining funding for countryplace and obtaining wholesale financing are key risk factors that could impair the growth of our company

net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales for the factory built housing segment increased million primarily due to a shift in product mix to modular homes which have a higher average selling price than manufactured homes  for modular homes compared to  for manufactured homes 
the number of modular homes sold during fiscal increased compared to fiscal and comprised of total factory built home sales in fiscal versus in fiscal financial services revenue increased million reflecting an increase in the number of renewals of insurance policies at standard casualty and an increase in interest income at countryplace resulting from an increase in loans held for investment from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to  or million  from  or million  in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased million from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal this decrease is principally the result of million of charges related to closing of our least productive sales centers and streamlining our retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  the internalization rate  which is the percentage of factory built homes we manufactured and sold through our company owned retail superstores and builder locations  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for factory built housing decreased million in fiscal due to a focus on reducing costs  offset by million in charges associated with closing under performing sales centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for general corporate purposes decreased million primarily resulting from a million decrease in advertising costs  million decrease in workers compensation reserves due to the reduction in our workforce several years ago  million decrease in expenses related to the long term incentive plan which was modified in fiscal  and million decrease in salaries and bonuses offset by million increase in expenses related to becoming sarbanes oxley compliant 
selling  general and administrative expenses for financial services increased million primarily due to additional expenses related to commissions and amortization of debt issue costs associated with the expansion of countryplace 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense 
table of contents incurred on the warehouse revolving debt and hedge facility and million in interest expense incurred on the million convertible senior notes that were issued during the first quarter of fiscal this increase is offset by a million reduction in flooring interest resulting from a decrease in the floor plan liability from million at march  to million at march  equity in earnings loss of limited partnership 
equity in earnings loss of limited partnership decreased to a million loss in fiscal as compared to million of earnings in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to our share of operating losses at bsm increasing due to a lesser number of mortgage refinance originations in fiscal compared to fiscal other income 
other income increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million increase in income earned on a real estate investment 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales for the factory built housing segment increased million primarily due to modular sales which totaled million in fiscal versus million in fiscal  which was somewhat offset by a decrease in overall manufactured housing volume 
the volume of manufactured homes sold through our retail superstores declined while overall manufactured housing unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new manufactured home to  in from  in this increase in average selling price resulted primarily from our passing higher materials costs on to the customer through price increases as well as a shift in product mix towards multi section manufactured homes  which constituted of our manufactured homes sold in  as compared to in fiscal  as customers are purchasing larger homes with more amenities 
the number of our retail superstores and builder locations decreased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal financial services revenue increased million  which consists of a million increase in interest income resulting from an increase in the loans held for investment from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal  and a million increase in insurance revenues 
gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to  or million  from  or million  in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased million from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal this decrease is principally the result of price increases of approximately million in lumber  gypsum and other materials which outpaced materials price increases to customers 
the percentage of factory built homes sold through our retail superstores and builder locations decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for factory built housing decreased million in fiscal  which reflects a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with nine fewer retail superstores and a focus on reducing fixed costs in fiscal offset by an increase of million due to selling  general and administrative expenses including months of nationwide s expenses in fiscal versus months in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for financial services increased million primarily due to additional expenses related to the expansion of countryplace 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the average floor plan liability in fiscal coupled with a slight decrease in the prime interest rate from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal 
table of contents equity in earnings of limited partnership 
equity earnings in limited partnership decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this million decrease was primarily due to our share of operating losses at bsm in the last half of fiscal resulting from a decline in the number of mortgage refinance originations and a decline in margins due to the timing differential between loans funded and loans sold to investors 
other income 
other income decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this slight decrease was due to a million decrease in interest income  million decrease in income earned on a real estate investment offset by an increase of million in gains on short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   down from million at march  during fiscal  net cash used in operating activities totaled million and consisted of million used for originating loans at countryplace  offset by million provided by principal payments on loans originated  million used to increase inventory through a greater number of homes per sales center as well as a higher average invoice cost per home  and million used to increase restricted cash for outstanding letters of credit which collateralized insurance programs and surety bonds and principal and interest payments on the loans that are in the warehouse 
net cash used in investing activities consisted of million used for net purchases of property  plant and equipment and million of net purchases of investments by standard casualty 
net proceeds from the warehouse facility of million and convertible senior notes of million were offset by payments of million on floor plan liabilities and million on bonds payable to contribute to the million in net cash provided by financing activities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we amended our agreement with a financial institution from an million syndicated floor plan facility expiring march  to a million facility expiring may  the advance rate for this facility is of manufacturer s invoice 
this facility is used to finance a portion of the new home inventory at our retail superstores and is secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rate on the facility is prime at march  or prime plus to for aged units  of which we have none as of march  the floor plan facility contains certain provisions requiring us to maintain minimum amounts of liquidity  profitability  inventory turns and tangible net worth in order to borrow against the facility 
as of march   we were not in compliance with one of these provisions and have since obtained a waiver of default from the lending institution 
in the event we are not in compliance with any of our floor plan facility requirements in future periods  we would seek a waiver of any default from the lending institutions and  if no such waiver was obtained  maturities of outstanding debt could be accelerated 
we had million and million outstanding under these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 
on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private  unregistered offering 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
on june   the initial purchaser of the notes exercised its option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
on september   for the benefit of the note holders  the company filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
the notes are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness 
each  in principal amount of the notes is convertible  at the option of the holder  at a conversion price of  or shares of our common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies 
we used the majority of the proceeds from the offering to reduce our floor plan payable from million at march  to million at march  the remainder of the proceeds has been used to help fund countryplace s operations and for general corporate purposes 
in march  through our subsidiary countryplace  we entered into an agreement with a financial institution for a million warehouse borrowing facility to fund chattel loans originated by company owned retail superstores 
the facility is collateralized by specific receivables pledged to the facility and bears 
table of contents interest at the rate of libor at march  plus 
the facility terminates on march   however  amounts outstanding under the facility are effectively settled and re borrowed on a monthly basis 
the facility provides for an advance of against the outstanding principal balance of eligible receivables  as defined in the warehouse agreement 
the facility provided for an advance rate adjustment on march  as determined by the financial institution 
the advance rate was not lowered by the financial institution  and therefore the facility was not terminated and countryplace was obligated to pay a fee of million to the financial institution 
the million fee is being amortized over the remaining term of the facility 
countryplace had outstanding borrowings under the warehouse facility of million and million as of march  and march   respectively 
the facility contains certain requirements relating to the performance and composition of the receivables pledged to the facility and financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a certain loan delinquency ratio  minimum ratio of liabilities to stockholder s equity for countryplace and a minimum capitalization for countryplace  which are customary in the industry 
as of march   countryplace was in compliance with these requirements 
in connection with the warehouse borrowing facility  we agreed to fund in cash to countryplace up to of each loan loss incurred 
during the fiscal year ended march   we funded  to countryplace under this loss funding arrangement 
as countryplace continues to expand and draw down on its warehouse facility  we will fund of any additional loan originations 
should countryplace increase its borrowings under the facility to the maximum million  we will have to originate an additional million of new loans  of which million will have to be funded through our operations 
during fiscal year ended march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on our variable rate debt in order to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates 
the terms of the agreement effectively fix the interest rate on million of our variable rate  long term warehouse revolving debt at per annum 
based on the terms and conditions  under sfas no 
s and  accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  we recorded the hedge instrument at fair value as of march  with the effective offsetting portion of the hedge recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion  if any  of the hedge recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of march   we had no significant ineffective portion and we recorded an unrealized gain of million  net of tax  related to our interest rate swap agreement 
countryplace currently intends to originate and hold loans for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are credit worthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  originating and holding loans for investment subjects countryplace to more credit and interest rate risk than the previous business practice of originating loans for resale 
the ability of customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors and if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow of the loan portfolio would be adversely affected 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio on a routine basis 
while we believe it will be able to obtain additional liquidity through the securitization of such loans  no assurances can be made that countryplace will successfully complete securitization transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
we believe that the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes  floor plan financing  available borrowing alternatives including securitizations in addition to the warehouse facility  will be adequate to support our working capital needs  currently planned capital expenditure needs and expansion of countryplace for the foreseeable future 
however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  the market for asset backed securitizations  and other factors beyond our control  no assurances can be given in this regard

our losses related to these contingent repurchase obligations were   and  during fiscal   and  respectively 
for additional information on our repurchase obligations  see critical accounting policies reserve for repurchase obligations 
we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the industry 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets on an annual basis  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents recovery of deferred tax asset 
we believe it is more likely than not we will recover all of our net deferred tax assets 
recovery of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  which we currently believe will come from future profitable operating results and available tax planning strategies 
should we continue to operate unprofitably  or otherwise change our estimate of future profitable operations  we may need to record a valuation allowance on all or a part of our deferred tax assets 
net deferred tax assets at march  and march  are million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition 
retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
additionally  for retail sales of all multi story modular homes  nationwide modular homes  and manufactured homes in which we serve as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process  revenue is not recognized until after final consumer closing 
transportation costs  unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer  are included in the cost of sales 
warranties 
we provide the retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
reserve for repurchase obligations 
manufactured housing companies enter into repurchase agreements with financial institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to independent retailers 
these agreements generally provide that in the event of a retailer s default we will repurchase the financed home from the lending institution at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement generally months 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i only of our homes are sold to independent retailers  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent retailers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of retailers  v none of our independent retailers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
allowance for loan losses 
countryplace originates and holds for investment purposes loans related to the retail sale of our manufactured homes  with such loans being collateralized primarily by the manufactured home 
we provide allowances for estimated future loan losses at the time of sale and during the term of the loan 
the allowance for loan losses gives consideration to the composition of the loan portfolio  including number of delinquencies and historical loss experience  and expectations as to future loan losses based upon industry knowledge 
although countryplace maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon these expectations and other criteria  future differences between countryplace s expectations with respect to loan losses and actual losses incurred in the portfolio could differ  and require countryplace to provide additional allowances 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years 
table of contents beginning after june   though earlier application is permitted 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in september and december  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a final consensus in eitf issue the effect of contingently convertible debt on earnings per share affirming its tentative conclusion with respect to the accounting for contingently convertible debt instruments  which generally become convertible into common stock only if one or more specified events occurs such as the underlying common stock achieving a specified target 
under previous interpretations of fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  issuers of contingently convertible debt instruments generally excluded the dilutive effects of potential common shares underlying such debt from earnings per share calculations until the market price or other contingency was met 
in the final consensus  among other things  the eitf concluded that the effect of contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in earnings per share computations  if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
for all periods presented herein  we have considered the consensus reached in eitf in calculating dilutive earnings per share  however  the effect of applying such consensus was anti dilutive for the fiscal year ended march  and for each of its quarterly periods therein and thus earnings per share is not impacted 
approximately  shares of common stock to which the senior notes could be converted were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the antidilution 
forward looking information risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report are forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
investors should be aware that all forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and  as a result of certain factors  actual results could differ materially from these expressed in or implied by such statements 
these risks include such assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors associated with the following financing for our retail customers may be limited  which could affect our sales volume 
our retail customers generally secure financing from third party lenders  which have been negatively affected by adverse loan experience 
conseco finance servicing corp 
and the associates  which had provided financing for our customers  have withdrawn from the manufactured housing finance business 
reduced availability of such financing is currently having an adverse effect on the manufactured housing business and our home sales 
availability of financing is dependent on the lending practices of financial institutions  financial markets  governmental policies and economic conditions  all of which are largely beyond our control 
quasi governmental agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac  which are important purchasers of loans from financial institutions  have tightened standards relating to the manufactured housing loans that they will buy 
most states classify manufactured homes as personal property rather than real property for purposes of taxation and lien perfection  and interest rates for manufactured homes are generally higher and the terms of the loans shorter than for site built homes 
financing for the purchase of manufactured homes is often more difficult to obtain than conventional home mortgages 
there can be no assurance that affordable retail financing for manufactured homes will continue to be available on a widespread basis 
if third party financing were to become unavailable or were to be further restricted  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if countryplace is unable to securitize its loans  it will be required to seek other sources of long term funding  which funding may not be available 
our owned subsidiary  countryplace  originates chattel and non conforming land home mortgage loans that are funded with proceeds from its warehouse borrowing facility and borrowings from us 
we anticipate that a primary future source of funding for countryplace will be from securitizations of its mortgage 
table of contents loans 
the proceeds from the securitizations will be used to repay any borrowings from the warehouse facility and from us  as well as to originate new loans 
the securitization market is dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic conditions  conditions in the securities market generally and conditions in the asset backed securities market specifically 
although the asset backed securitization market for manufactured housing lenders has improved slightly in the past year in terms of access to the markets  as well as pricing and credit enhancement levels  poor performance of any loans we may securitize in the future could harm our future access to the securitization market 
if countryplace is unable to securitize its loans on terms that are economical  or if there is a decline in the securitization market for manufactured housing lenders  and if countryplace is unable to obtain additional sources of long term funding  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business prospects 
if countryplace is unable to adequately and timely service its loans  it may adversely affect its results of operations 
although countryplace has originated loans since  it has limited loan servicing and collections experience 
in  it implemented new systems to service and collect the portfolio of loans it originates 
the management of countryplace has industry experience in managing  servicing and collecting loan portfolios  however  many borrowers require notices and reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and foreclosures 
a substantial increase in the delinquency rate that results from improper servicing or mortgage loan performance in general could adversely affect the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio in countryplace 
if countryplace s customers are unable to repay their loans  countryplace may be adversely affected 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are creditworthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  the ability of these customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to national  regional and local economic conditions  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  natural hazard risks affecting the region in which the borrower resides  and employment  financial or life circumstances 
if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio could adversely affect countryplace and our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
reduced availability of wholesale financing may adversely affect our inventory levels of new homes 
we finance a portion of our new inventory at our retail superstores through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
through these arrangements  financial institutions provide us with a loan for the purchase price of the home 
since the beginning of the industry downturn in  several major floor plan lenders have exited the floor plan financing business 
although we currently have a floor plan facility with a financial institution totaling million  there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to such a facility or that we will not be forced to reduce our new home inventory at our retail superstores 
our repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders could result in increased costs 
in accordance with customary practice in the manufactured housing industry  we enter into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions pursuant to which we agree  in the event of a default by an independent retailer in its obligation to these credit sources  to repurchase manufactured homes at declining prices over the term of the agreements  typically to months 
the difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased manufactured homes can then be resold  which is typically at a discount to the original sale price  is an expense to us 
thus  if we were obligated to repurchase a large number of manufactured homes in the future  this would increase our costs  which could have a negative effect on our 
table of contents earnings 
tightened credit standards by lenders and more aggressive attempts to accelerate collection of outstanding accounts with retailers could result in defaults by retailers and consequently repurchase obligations on our part may be higher than has historically been the case 
during fiscal  and  net expenses incurred under these repurchase agreements totaled   and  respectively 
increased prices and unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us 
our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials 
in fiscal and  we experienced an increase in prices of our raw materials of and  respectively 
although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materials costs  such increases typically lag behind the escalation of materials costs 
many of the most important raw materials used in our operations have experienced significant price fluctuations in the past two fiscal years 
although we have not experienced any shortage of such building materials today  there can be no assurance that sufficient supplies of lumber  gypsum wallboard and insulation  as well as other materials  will continue to be available to us on terms we regard as satisfactory 
we are dependent on our principal executive officer and the loss of his service could adversely affect us 
we are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our principal executive officer  larry h 
keener  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of our principal executive officer could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our continued growth is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel 
we are controlled by two shareholders  who may determine the outcome of all elections 
approximately of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned or controlled by our chairman emeritus of the board  lee posey and capital southwest corporation and its affiliates 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  are able to determine the outcome of elections of our directors and thereby control the management of our business 
if inflation increases  we may not be able to offset inflation through increased selling prices 
if there is a material increase in inflation in the future  it is unlikely that we will be able to increase our selling prices to completely offset the material increase in inflation and as a result  our operating results may be adversely affected 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors have stronger balance sheets and cash flow  as well as greater access to capital  than we do 
as a result of these competitive conditions  we may not be able to sustain past levels of sales or profitability 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive  with relatively low barriers to entry 
manufactured and modular homes compete with new and existing site built homes and to a lesser degree  with apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
competition exists at both the manufacturing and retail levels and is based primarily on price  product features  reputation for service and quality  retailer promotions  merchandising and terms of consumer financing 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
as a result of these competitive conditions  we may not be able to sustain past levels of sales or profitability 
our business is highly cyclical and there may be significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
the manufactured and modular housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and has experienced wide fluctuations in aggregate sales in the past 
we are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors beyond our control such as the level and stability of interest rates  
table of contents unemployment trends  the availability of retail financing  the availability of wholesale financing  housing supply and demand  industry availability of used or repossessed manufactured homes  international tensions and hostilities  levels of consumer confidence  inventory levels  regulatory and zoning matters  and changes in general economic conditions 
sales in our industry are also seasonal in nature  with sales of homes traditionally being stronger in the spring  summer and fall months 
the cyclical and seasonal nature of our business causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and makes it difficult for management to forecast sales and profits in uncertain times 
as a result of seasonal and cyclical downturns  results from any quarter should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future quarters 
we are concentrated geographically  which could harm our business 
in fiscal  of our revenues were generated in florida and of our revenues were generated in texas 
a decline in the demand for manufactured housing in these two states and or a decline in the economies of these two states could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements and warehouse revolving debt  and our fixed rate convertible senior notes and loans receivable balances 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk related to approximately million of our variable rate borrowings 
for variable interest rate obligations  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
assuming our and countryplace s level of variable rate debt as of march  is held constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
for fixed rate loans receivable  changes in interest rates do not change future earnings and cash flows from the receivables 
however  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the loan portfolio 
assuming countryplace s level of loans held for investment as of march  is held constant  a increase in average interest rates would decrease the fair value of countryplace s portfolio by approximately million 
this decrease in fair value is not linear to changes in interest rates and may or may not have any impact on the realizable amount of the receivables 
for our fixed rate senior notes  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the related debt 
assuming the amount of convertible senior notes as of march  is held constant  a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the notes by approximately million 
countryplace is exposed to market risk related to the accessibility and terms of financing in the asset backed securities market 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio as a means to obtain long term fixed interest rate funding 
the asset backed securities market for manufactured housing has been volatile during the past year 
the inability to securitize its loans would require countryplace to seek other sources of funding or to reduce or eliminate its loan originations if other sources of funding are not available
