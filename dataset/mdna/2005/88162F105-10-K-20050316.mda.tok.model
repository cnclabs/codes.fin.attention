item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of the company s consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item business certain business risks and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview the company was successful in its continuing growth strategy during with the completion of the three largest acquisition transactions in the company s history 
in september  the company acquired the european calcium chloride manufacturing assets of kemira oyj of helsinki  finland 
also in september  the company purchased an ton heavy lift derrick barge to expand its gulf of mexico decommissioning operations 
in july  the company acquired a growing oil and gas wellhead compression business  compressco  inc compressco  which serves the onshore oil and gas markets principally in the mid continent  rocky mountain  texas and louisiana regions of the united states and western canada 
each of these acquisitions added strategic market and operating capabilities to their respective company operating segment 
primarily due to these acquisition transactions  the company s total assets increased approximately during the year  totaling million at december  the acquisitions were funded from available cash and from funds obtained under the company s credit facility debt and from a fixed rate  unsecured private debt offering 
the company s total outstanding long term debt balance at december  was million  which is scheduled to mature from through the company s results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the steadily increasing demand for many of the company s products and services  as well as the impact during the last portion of the year from the recent acquisitions mentioned above 
demand for the company s products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which is significantly affected by the level of capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by industry expectations of oil and gas commodity prices and the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas 
industry expenditures for drilling  as indicated by onshore rig count statistics  have risen steadily during the past three years and reflect the industry s response to higher crude oil and natural gas pricing during this period 
the impact of such increased industry activity and spending is reflected in the company s revenues and operating cash flows during the company expects that such increased industry spending levels will continue during the gulf of mexico and selected international oil and gas rig counts are leading indicators for the fluids division 
the maturity of gulf of mexico producing fields  oil and gas prices and government regulations are the primary long term drivers for the wa d division 
natural gas prices and gas drilling rig counts in north and south america are key indicators for the production enhancement division 
gulf of mexico oil and gas rig counts were down during  averaging rigs compared to an average of during international rig counts averaged during compared to during  with a majority of the increase generated in latin america  where the company has its most significant international production testing operations 
us natural gas drilling increased during compared to the prior year  with an average gas rig count of   average during the fourth quarter of compared to an average during over the longer term  the company believes that there will continue to be growth opportunities for the company s products and services in both the us and international markets 
such increased activity will be supported by deeper gas drilling operations with more complex completions in the us  faster reservoir depletion in the us  more rigorous environmental and abandonment regulations  advancing age of offshore platforms in the us  increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad  and increasing future demand for natural gas and oil in the us and abroad 
the fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling completion fluids and providing filtration and associated products and engineering services to exploration and production companies worldwide 
the fluids division sells products and services to domestic and international energy market customers 
the demand for these products and services are particularly affected by drilling activity in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or decreased during the past several years due to the maturity of a majority of gulf of mexico producing fields 
the fluids division implemented a market penetration strategy during in order to increase the sales volumes and revenues for its products during the year compared to the fluids division also markets certain liquid and dry calcium chloride manufactured at its production facilities to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
with the september acquisition of the kemira calcium chloride assets  the fluids division has expanded its calcium chloride manufacturing operations into european markets and further reduced the fluids division s dependence on gulf of mexico drilling activity for growth 
the increased worldwide calcium chloride operations  combined with the company s current market position as a major supplier of oil and gas completion fluids  are expected to provide a further increase in revenues and cash flows for this division in the wa d division generates revenues and cash flows by performing well plug and abandonment  pipeline and platform decommissioning and removal and site clearance services for oil and gas companies 
in addition  the division provides electric wireline  workover  engineering and drilling services and  through its maritech subsidiary  is a producer of oil and gas 
services are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us including onshore  offshore and in inland waters 
long term platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by mms regulations and the age of gulf of mexico producing fields and production platforms and structures 
in the shorter term  activity levels are driven by oil and gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties and oil and gas company activity levels 
while the continued strength of crude oil and natural gas prices during benefited maritech s revenues and cash flows  such prices led to the postponement during the year of well abandonment and decommissioning activities of many of the wa d division s customers  including maritech  who have delayed the sale or abandonment of mature producing properties 
in addition  the gulf of mexico abandonment and decommissioning market is highly competitive  and the division s success in bidding to provide services can fluctuate from year to year 
as a result of the above factors  wa d revenues decreased significantly during compared to the prior year 
during late and throughout  however  many wa d division customers have sold numerous offshore gulf of mexico producing properties 
in addition  given overall production declines and the advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  management s long term expectation is that the division s well abandonment and decommissioning activity levels should increase in the future 
maritech s acquisition strategy is strongly affected by oil and gas prices and by the actions of competitors which affect its ability to acquire mature producing properties on acceptable terms 
maritech generated increased revenues and cash flows during  resulting from higher commodity prices  the acquisitions of producing properties that were consummated in and  and successful exploitation of existing properties 
the production enhancement division formerly the testing services division  and renamed following the acquisition of compressco generates revenues and cash flows by performing flowback pressure and volume testing and providing low pressure wellhead compression equipment and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary testing markets served are texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama  offshore gulf of mexico  mexico and venezuela 
compressco s primary markets include the mid continent  rocky mountain  texas and louisiana regions of the united states and western canada 
the production enhancement division also provides technology and services required for separation and recycling of oily residuals generated from petroleum refining  primarily to oil refineries in the united states 
production enhancement division revenues increased significantly during compared to the prior year  due to the july acquisition of compressco 
management expects additional growth in this division in  due largely to the acquisition of compressco and due to anticipated further increases in industry drilling and completion activities  both domestically and internationally 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company makes assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
the company periodically evaluates its estimates and judgments related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectibility of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and with changes in the company s operating environment 
actual results are likely to differ from the company s current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on the company s judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and the company s estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field  and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of proved reserves 
maritech s oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
maritech purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
the acquired oil and gas producing properties are recorded at a cost equal to the estimated fair value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  adjusted by the amount of any cash or other consideration received or paid 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred  compared to the estimated amounts recorded  will affect the company s anticipated profitability 
decommissioning liabilities the company estimates the third party market values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amount to be paid by the previous owners of the property referred to as decommissioning liabilities 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  the company performs detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any profit earned by the company in performing such abandonment and decommissioning operations on maritech s properties is recorded as the work is performed 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the costs of the work performed is recorded as additional profit on the project and included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
the company reviews the adequacy of its decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which  in turn  would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects from billings under contracts  which are typically of short duration  that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby the company estimates whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
a significant portion of the company s revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies 
if  due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed the company  an additional bad debt allowance may be required 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
acquisition purchase price allocations the accounting for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
the company estimates the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and in many cases such estimates are based on the company s judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the company completed several acquisitions during and has accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on its estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
certain of the company s estimates of fair value for assets acquired during are preliminary  and may change as additional information becomes available 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report

consolidated gross profit as a percent of revenue was during the current year  compared to during the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase was reflective of the overall growth in the company s operations due to acquisitions and primarily consists of approximately million of salary  incentive and employee benefit cost increases  million of increased professional fees primarily for corporate compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act  plus approximately million of increased insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to  versus in the prior year 
interest expense and income taxes during  the company recorded million of net interest expense  compared to million of net interest expense in the prior year  primarily due to the significant increase in the outstanding balances of long term debt beginning in the third quarter of such borrowings  which were used to fund the acquisitions of compressco  the kemira calcium chloride assets and a heavy lift barge during the third quarter of  consisted of borrowings under the company s line of credit facility and from the issuance of debt in a private debt offering 
future periods will reflect the increased interest expense related to these borrowings until they are repaid 
the provision for income taxes was million in  a decrease of million  primarily as a result of decreased earnings compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the year decreased to during compared to in  due primarily to an increase in income from existing international operations as well as the operations from the newly acquired kemira calcium chloride assets during the third quarter of net income income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million during  compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of 
income per diluted share before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was on  average diluted shares outstanding during  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
discontinued operations during consist of the norwegian process services operations 
during  discontinued operations also included the operations of damp rid  inc  which was sold in september the company recorded a gain of million from the sale of damp rid  net of taxes of million  and a loss of million for the asset impairment related to the future disposal of the norwegian process services facility  net of million tax benefit 
in july  the financial accounting standards board released sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as part of the carrying value of the asset when the obligation is incurred 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  prior to  the company expensed the costs of retiring its non oil and gas properties at the time of retirement 
in addition  prior to the company recorded the retirement obligations associated with its oil and gas properties at an undiscounted fair market value 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
was to record a charge of million per diluted share  net of taxes of million  during the first quarter of  to expense the costs of retirement obligations associated with the company s existing long lived assets and to accrete the liability to its present value as of january  net income was million during  compared to million in the prior year period 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year period 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased million  or  during compared to the prior year  totaling million during this increase was due to increased market share for certain of the division s products and services  despite the impact of reduced gulf of mexico drilling activity 
a portion of this market share increase was due to the september acquisition of the kemira calcium chloride assets  which generated revenues during the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
fluids division gross profit during increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increased market share for certain of the division s products  including the impact of the acquisition mentioned above  generated approximately million of increased gross profit 
this increased gross profit was partially offset by the impact of decreased prices and increased net costs for certain of the division s products  including feedstocks  transportation and utilities  which decreased gross profit by approximately million 
fluids division income before taxes during totaled million  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or  as the million increase in gross margin discussed above was partially offset by increased administrative expenses 
wa d division the wa d division generated revenues of million during  compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the division s well abandonment and decommissioning operations reported decreased revenues of million  primarily due to reduced overall abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico  and despite a million increase in wireline and onshore well abandonment revenues 
much of the gulf of mexico abandonment and decommissioning activity was postponed by many wa d division customers  including maritech  due to strong commodity prices during in addition  storm activity in the gulf of mexico during caused increased delays in well abandonment and decommissioning activity compared to the prior year 
the division s success in bidding for such services can also fluctuate from year to year  given the substantial competition for its services in the gulf of mexico 
well abandonment and decommissioning revenues during the fourth quarter of did increase compared to the prior year quarter  however  which was partially due to the division s september purchase of a heavy lift barge 
maritech reported increased revenues of million during compared to  as an increase in realized commodity prices generated million of additional revenues and increased production volumes generated million of increased revenue 
such production volume increases were due to producing property acquisitions and exploitation efforts  and more than offset normal production declines 
maritech suffered storm damage to one of its offshore production platforms during hurricane ivan  causing one of its producing properties to remain shut in 
maritech is currently in the process of evaluating the extent of the damage  which is covered by insurance 
wa d division gross profit decreased million  or  to million during from million during the prior year 
the long term drivers for the well abandonment operations are primarily mms regulations  the overall maturity of gulf of mexico fields and the age of the platforms and structures in the gulf 
however  the impact of short term factors discussed above caused a decrease in the wa d division s gulf of mexico well abandonment and decommissioning activity levels during and contributed to a reduction in equipment and personnel utilization  resulting in decreased gross profit of approximately million for the well abandonment and decommissioning operations 
as existing gulf of mexico fields continue to deplete and as offshore platforms continue to age  management s long term expectation is that well abandonment and decommissioning activities should increase in the future 
maritech s gross profit increased by approximately million during  compared to the prior year 
maritech generated million of additional gross profit from increased commodity prices and million from higher production volumes due to property acquisitions and reserve volume increases 
these increases more than offset million of increased lease operating expenses  resulting from workover and exploitation projects conducted during the remaining net increase in maritech s gross profit of million is due to the difference in the amount of property impairments recorded in of million compared to million recorded in wa d division income before taxes totaled million during  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit described above  plus approximately million of additional administrative expenses during the year primarily from increased salaries and employer s liability insurance related expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by a million gain on the sale of an asset 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased million  or  to million during  compared to million during the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the july acquisition of compressco  which generated million of revenues during the last half of the year 
the division s production testing revenues were relatively flat compared to the prior year  despite increased industry activity  primarily due to competitive pressures  the inactivity of a major domestic customer and due to contract interruptions in latin america during a portion of the year 
in addition  the company s process services operations generated a million increase in revenues due to higher processed volumes at certain of its contract locations 
the production enhancement division reported gross profit of million during compared to million during  a increase 
the addition of compressco  beginning in july  increased gross profit by million 
in addition  the process services operations generated million of added gross profit  primarily from increased efficiencies due to the higher volumes processed 
production testing gross profit decreased approximately million during the year  primarily due to the latin american contract interruptions 
income before taxes for the production enhancement division increased from million during to million during this increase was primarily due to the increased gross profit discussed above  less approximately million of increased administrative costs  primarily from the acquisition of compressco 
in addition  the division s results reflected approximately million in additional gains during the prior year period from the sale of certain production testing equipment 
corporate overhead the company includes in corporate overhead general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s business segments  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million during to million during the current year  primarily due to a million increase in administrative expenses  primarily from increased salaries and professional fee expenses associated with increased corporate compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  net interest expense increased million during  due to the increased long term borrowings beginning in the third quarter of  which were utilized to fund acquisitions during the period 
compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million during  an increase of 
each of the company s operating divisions reflected an increase in revenues during compared to the prior year 
consolidated gross profit for was million compared to million during  an increase of 
overall  gross profit was of revenues during compared to of revenues during general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses increased million to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of 
this increase was primarily caused by a million increase in payroll and incentive compensation and a million increase in professional fees consistent with the company s growth and with industry trends 
the increase in professional fees was also due to unusually low professional fees during due to the recovery of million of legal fees associated with a long standing lawsuit 
also  beginning in the company reflected million of accretion expenses related to asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
rules 
despite these increases in general and administrative costs  as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues during compared to of revenues during other income expense other income and expense was million of income for compared to million of income in the prior year 
this change is primarily due to million of gains on sales of property  plant and equipment during  compared to a million loss on such disposals in the prior year 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of  due to the company s reduction and eventual payment of the balance outstanding under its bank credit facility during also  prior to paying the remaining balance of the facility  interest expense was reflected at lower interest rates during compared to the prior year s expense  due partly to the company s interest rate swap contract  which expired after the end of the company s average interest rate during was approximately 
the provision for income taxes was million in  an increase of million  as a result of increased earnings compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the year decreased to during compared to in  due primarily to a reduction in the impact of international income taxes 
net income net income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million during compared to million during net income per diluted share before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was with  shares outstanding compared to with  shares outstanding 
in september  the company sold its subsidiary  damp rid  inc  and made the decision to discontinue its norwegian process services operation 
the company recorded a gain of million from the sale of damp rid  net of taxes of million  and a loss of million for the asset impairment related to the disposal of the norwegian process services facility  net of a million tax benefit 
net income from discontinued operations per diluted share during was compared to a net loss of in the prior year  primarily due to the net gain on the disposal of damp rid 
in july  the financial accounting standards board released sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as part of the carrying value of the asset when the obligation is incurred 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas on january  prior to  the company expensed the costs of retiring its non oil and gas properties at the time of retirement 
in addition  prior to the company recorded the retirement obligations associated with its oil and gas properties at an undiscounted fair market value 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
was to record a charge of million per diluted share  net of taxes of million  to expense the costs of retirement obligations associated with the company s existing long lived assets and to accrete the liability to its present value as of january  net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
net income per diluted share was with  shares outstanding compared to with  shares outstanding 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased million to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of  primarily due to an approximate million increase from higher domestic product sales volumes and approximately million from pricing improvements 
the division also reflected increased revenues of approximately million  resulting from improved utilization of filtration service equipment and an estimated million from fluids product market share gains 
these increases domestically were largely offset  however  by decreases in international fluids revenues  particularly in the united kingdom and norway  where decreased north sea activity contributed to a revenue decrease of million compared to the prior year 
despite the overall revenue increase  gross profit for the fluids division decreased by million to million  a decrease 
gross profit percentage for the fluids division decreased from of revenues during to of revenues during  as approximately million of increases in product and related costs  including feedstocks  transportation  utilities  repair and maintenance  payroll and insurance more than offset million of pricing increases 
gross profits were also lower by approximately million  due to lower margin product sales in certain operating areas 
fluids division profitability was particularly affected by a decline in activity related to the decrease in the average gulf of mexico rig count during compared to the above mentioned decrease in north sea activity also resulted in an additional gross profit decrease of approximately million related to the division s international operations 
fluids division income before taxes decreased by million to million during  a decrease compared to the prior year  due to the above mentioned million decrease in gross profit  offset partially by approximately million in decreased overall administrative costs for the division 
wa d division the wa d division reflected revenues of million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the largest revenue increase was generated by the division s offshore abandonment and decommissioning business  with an increase of million  which captured an increased share of the overall increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico and  in particular  benefited from the timing during of several large projects for specific customers 
the division s inland water well abandonment operations also reflected increased activity early in the year  with a million increase despite lower rates for its services due to competition and its land operations contributed a million increase  which includes approximately million of added revenues from an acquisition during also contributing to the increased wa d division revenues was its maritech oil and gas production subsidiary  which contributed approximately million of additional production revenues related to producing properties acquired in late and early  and an approximate million increase in revenues from higher oil and gas commodity prices during wa d division gross profit also rose significantly  increasing from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
gross profit percentage for the wa d division increased to of revenues from of revenues in the prior year 
these gross profit increases were also led by the division s offshore abandonment and decommissioning operations  which reflected a gross profit increase of million  primarily from the successful completion of several large projects and a million gain from the settlement of an insurance claim for the prior year s damages to the company s heavy lift barge 
the division s inland water plug and abandonment and rig operations reflected approximately a million decrease in gross profit compared to the prior year  and were negatively affected during the second half of by lower rates and reduced activity related to the recent and pending ownership changes of many inland water properties 
maritech s gross profit increased approximately million due to the above mentioned producing property acquisitions as well as approximately million from increased commodity prices 
such increases more than offset the million charge for maritech s relinquishment of an oil and gas property during the year 
income before taxes for the wa d division increased significantly to million  a million or increase from the prior year 
the above mentioned increase in gross profit of million was offset partially by approximately million of division personnel infrastructure cost increases  consistent with the increased levels of activity 
the division also reflected million of expense related to sfas no 
accretion for maritech s abandonment and decommissioning liabilities beginning in production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased million during  from million during to million  an increase of  largely due to a million revenue increase from the domestic production testing operations  which reflected increased drilling and completion activity in texas and louisiana 
this increase in domestic production testing activity more than offset a million decline in production testing revenues in mexico and venezuela 
revenues for process services increased million during compared to the prior year  due to higher demand and increased processed volumes 
gross profit for the production enhancement division was million during and increased domestic production testing activity was more than offset by increased costs and the lower overall utilization of the operation s resource base  resulting in a million decrease in gross profit for this business 
the increased process services demand resulted in throughput efficiencies which resulted in increased gross profit of approximately million 
division gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from to 
production enhancement division income before taxes decreased million  from million to million  a decrease compared to the prior year 
administrative costs for professional services increased during  compared to the prior year  due to the recovery during of approximately million of legal fees associated with a long standing lawsuit 
other administrative cost increases related to increased personnel infrastructure costs of approximately million  primarily related to the domestic production testing operations 
such increases were partially offset by million of gains on sales of production testing equipment during the year 
corporate overhead the company includes in corporate overhead general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s business segments  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million in to million during  a million increase compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily caused by approximately million of increased corporate salary and incentive compensation expenses  million of increased professional services and public company expenses  and million of increased corporate insurance expense 
such increases were partially mitigated by a million decrease in interest expense  as a result of the decrease in long term debt outstanding during  and an approximate million decrease in corporate insurance claims and other fringe benefit costs during the year 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   the company utilized a portion of its available capital resources to significantly increase its asset base  funding the three most significant business acquisition and asset purchase transactions in company history for an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately million  million of which have been classified as purchases of property  plant and equipment 
these transactions  along with approximately million of other capital expenditure activities  were funded primarily through the addition of approximately million of net long term borrowings  approximately million of cash provided from operating activities and approximately million of cash on hand at the beginning of the year 
despite the significant borrowings during the year  at december   the company continues to have excellent near term liquidity  long term borrowings are not scheduled to mature until through  and the company has additional availability under its bank credit facility of approximately million 
over the past three years  the company generated approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities  which it used to fund approximately million of capital expenditures and partially fund the purchase of million of business acquisitions 
operating activities the company continued to generate positive operating cash flow from each of its three operating divisions  resulting in total cash provided by operating activities of million during  compared to million during  an increase of 
due to the timing of the company s acquisitions  particularly the late september purchases of the kemira calcium chloride assets and the ton heavy lift barge  the newly acquired operations did not significantly affect consolidated operating cash flow during but are anticipated to generate additional operating cash flow beginning in future operating cash flow is largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas industry activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico region of the us while the company expects that such industry activity will increase in  the resulting net cash flow will also be affected by the impact of competition  the prices for its products and services  and the operating and administrative costs required to deliver its products and services 
in addition to the above factors  future operating cash flow will also continue to be somewhat affected by the timing of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
the third party market value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability was million as of december  the cash outflow necessary to extinguish this liability is expected to occur over several years  shortly after the end of each property s productive life
