item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
all years refer to the company s fiscal year which ends on june critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract accounting the company generates essentially all of its revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
the company considers fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost plus fee contracts that include performance based fee incentives  and that are subject to the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  the company recognizes the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as the company s prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
for such cost plus fee contracts subject to the provisions of us securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  the company recognizes the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus allowable expenses incurred 
the company has four basic categories of fixed price contracts  fixed unit price  fixed price level of effort  fixed price completion  and fixed price license 
revenue on fixed unit price contracts  where specified units of output under service arrangements are delivered  is recognized as units are delivered based on the specified price per unit 
revenue on fixed unit price maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the service period 
revenue for fixed price level of effort contracts is recognized based upon the number of units of labor actually delivered multiplied by the agreed rate for each unit of labor 
a significant portion of the company s fixed price completion contracts involve the design and development of complex client systems 
for these contracts that are within the scope of sop  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of sop  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
the company s fixed price license agreements and related services contracts are primarily executed in its international operations 
as the agreements to deliver software require significant production  modification or customization of software  revenue is recognized using the contract accounting guidance of sop for agreements to deliver data under license and related services  revenue is recognized as the data is delivered and services are performed 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  subcontracting costs  and other direct costs  as well as an allocation of allowable indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees for certain contracts are also a significant factor in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
products and services provided under long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
for our federal contracts  we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business operations personnel conduct thorough periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
allowance for doubtful accounts management establishes bad debt reserves against certain billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectible 
whenever judgment is involved in determining the estimates  there is the potential for bad debt expense and the fair value of accounts receivable to be misstated 
given that we primarily serve the us government and that  in our opinion  we have sufficient controls in place to properly recognize revenue  we believe the risk to be relatively low that a misstatement of accounts receivable would have a material impact on our financial results 
goodwill valuation acquisitions of businesses have constituted a major portion of the company s historical growth  and as a result goodwill has increased over the years to represent a significant portion of both our long term and total assets 
we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas  which requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
the fas goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
fas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment at the same date every year  and also when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the company has selected june as it annual testing date 
we estimate the fair values of the company s operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our estimates of future revenues and operating costs related to contract backlog and fundings  historical operating margins  recompete win rates  the length of customer relationships  and assessments of the market conditions surrounding the government information technology services industry 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by our senior management 
changes in these forecasts could cause the company to either pass or fail the first step in the fas no 
goodwill valuation model  which could result in impairment 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the requirement to recognize an impairment  and the amount of such impairment  if any 
as of june   a percent increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation for the fiscal periods through june   the company has accounted for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
alternative guidance under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  which required companies to determine the fair value of options at the time of grant using a fair value option pricing model  and to recognize compensation expense over the service period  was an available alternative to apb that the company could have used to account for stock based compensation 
if the company s employee stock based compensation had been accounted using the provisions of fas  the pro forma earnings would have been as follows year ended june  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income  as reported stock based compensation expense  net of income tax benefit  included in net income  as reported 
stock based compensation expense under fair value method as applied to all equity awards  net of income tax benefit net income  as adjusted basic earnings per share earnings per share  as reported incremental effect of stock based compensation  net of income tax benefit earnings per share  as adjusted diluted earnings per share as reported earnings per share incremental effect of stock based compensation  net of income tax benefit earnings per share  as adjusted these pro forma results may not be indicative of the future results due to forfeitures  differences between actual and expected lives of outstanding options  changes in the company s stock price  and changes in the quantity  and terms and conditions  of grants 
effective july   the company will adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments fas r  which requires the company to recognize the cost of all stock based compensation in its consolidated financial statements 
the valuation of equity instruments underlying stock based compensation  and the period during which the related stock compensation expense is recognized  are based in part on various assumptions including the estimated life of equity instruments  stock volatility  interest rates and vesting terms 
changes in these assumptions could have significant impacts on the expense recognized 
management has evaluated the impact that fas r will have on the company s consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ending june   and has reported the estimated impact in a current report k as filed with the sec on june  the company is analyzing the effect fas r is projected to have on financial reporting of its income tax expense in future years  and plans to conclude on the method of implementation in late september in conjunction with its adoption of fas r  the company will also begin to recognize the expense associated with restricted stock units rsu and non qualified stock options granted to employees that have reached  or are close to reaching  age in accordance with issue no 
of eitf bulletin no 
 issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 eitf  issue 
eitf became effective in september  and issue requires that the value of equity instruments awarded to employees that are eligible for retirement  and that contain terms which provide for immediate vesting upon retirement  be recognized in full upon grant 
issue of eitf also requires that the value of such equity instruments granted to employees nearing retirement age be recognized ratably over the period from the date of grant  to the date the grantee is eligible for retirement 
immediate recognition of expense the non substantive vesting method is required under issue of eitf even when the grantee has  or plans to  remain an employee of the company beyond the eligible retirement age 
during the year end june   the company began to include a provision in rsu grants that provided for accelerated vesting upon retirement at or after age the company extended this accelerated vesting condition to grants of non qualified stock options beginning july  the company has not  however  applied the non substantive vesting method in recognizing compensation expense pertaining to rsus in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended june  and furthermore  the company historically has not applied the provisions of issue of eitf when disclosing  in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements under the provisions of fas  the pro forma effect of stock based compensation expense pertaining to stock options granted to those age or older 
had the company applied the non substantive vesting method of eitf  the net income and basic and diluted earning per share for the year ended june   as reported  would have been affected by an insignificant amount 
the provisions of issue of eitf had no effect on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june   as the vesting of rsus granted during this year will not qualify for accelerated vesting under the retirement terms of the grants 
in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the company has disclosed the pro forma effect that stock based compensation expense would have had on net income  and basic and diluted earnings per share  had the company recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of fas  but without giving effect to the provisions of issue of eitf had the company applied the provisions of issue of eitf to its rsu expense  and to disclosures of pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share  these amounts would have been affected as follows pro forma amounts in the notes to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june   as disclosed effect of applying retirement vesting provisions to rsu expense and pro forma stock based compensation expense pro forma amounts in the notes to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june   as adjusted net income weighted average earnings per share basic diluted results of operations the following table sets forth the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue 
consolidated statements of operations year ended june    and years ended june  year to year change to to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars percent dollar amounts in thousands revenue cost expenses direct costs indirect costs selling expenses depreciation amortization total costs expenses income from operations interest expense income  net net income before income taxes income taxes net income revenue 
the table below sets forth  for the periods indicated the customer mix in revenue with related percentages of total revenue 
year ended june  dollar amounts in thousands department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial state and local government total for the year ended june   the company s total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and across a broad base of department of defense dod  intelligence  and federal civilian agency customers 
the remaining percent  or million  was from acquisitions completed in fy this growth is primarily from the demand of the company s federal customers for services and solutions 
this demand is driven by the company s support of mission critical needs of its army  navy and intelligence community customers 
during fy total revenue increased by million  or percent 
the revenue increase resulted primarily from continuing growth in the company s systems integration  engineering services and knowledge management offerings of its domestic operations and the successful integration of four acquisitions that broadened the company s portfolio of solutions offerings 
revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue growth 
the company s acquisitions accounted for million and million of the revenue growth for fy and fy  respectively  as follows business acquired ams defense intelligence group d ig cms c cubed mtl ptg acton burnell ats condor total revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to approximately billion for fy as compared to fy the aforementioned acquisitions accounted for approximately percent of this growth  contributing million 
the company s work with the us army  its largest customer  is driven by the need to support the warfighter in iraq  particularly through its support of tactical military intelligence  communications and logistics 
the company s work with the us navy remains strong  with increased levels of work coming through the seaport enhanced contract vehicle  and from its growing presence in supporting naval aviation 
in the dod financial management practice  the company continued to expand its ability to deliver enhanced services and solutions  positioning itself to participate in the modernization of legacy business systems 
dod revenue growth in fy of percent  or million  was driven by the above referenced acquisitions as well as the increased demand for mission critical support from customers such as strategic and tactical organizations in the military intelligence community  the us army intelligence and security command  the us army s communications electronics command  and the us navy s space and warfare command 
revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  or percent  to million for fy as compared to fy acquisitions accounted for all of the increase in this area 
the primary growth drivers were analysis and systems support of intelligence agencies and transformation work performed by the company s defense and intelligence group 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from department of justice doj  for whom the company provides litigation support services and maintains a debt collection system 
revenue from doj was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from fy to fy was due to a realignment of the federal government s spending priorities 
in fy  as compared to fy  doj accounted for percent or million of the revenue growth within federal civilian agencies 
during the same period the company also experienced increased revenue growth due to higher volumes of work from customers such as the department of veterans affairs va  the social security administration and other federal civilian agencies 
commercial revenue increased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy commercial revenue is derived from both international and domestic operations 
in fy  international operations accounted for percent  or million  of the total commercial revenue while the domestic operations accounted for percent  or million 
the increase in commercial revenue was primarily from the international operations within the united kingdom uk  which increased by percent  or million 
the uk growth came from its marketing systems group that supplies demographic software and data services  and its software services business particularly in the retail and telecommunications sectors 
the uk operations also benefited with a favorable foreign exchange movement 
the balance of the increase in commercial revenue was from the domestic operations  and specifically commercial revenue earned by d ig 
commercial revenue increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to fy again  the increase was primarily from the company s international operations within the uk 
revenue from state and local governments increased by percent  or million  to million for the year ended june  as compared to the same period a year ago 
approximately one third of this increase or million can be attributed to the march  acquisition of cms 
the balance of the million of growth was from an increased demand for information technology services that were provided across a number of states 
in fy as compared to fy  revenue from state and local governments increased by percent or million 
almost half of this increase was attributed to acquisition activity 
revenue from local governments represented percent and percent of the company s total revenue in fy and fy the company s continued and expanded focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities has resulted in a reduced emphasis on state and local governments business 
income from operations 
operating income increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to the same period a year ago 
operating margin in fy improved to percent from percent a year earlier 
this improvement was driven by the higher margins provided by d ig  economies of scale related with acquisitions  and the continued growth from higher margin national security and intelligence work 
the company was able to improve operating margins despite incurring significant costs related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley  legal costs related to operations in iraq  and non cash charges related with the expensing of restricted stock units rsus 
in fy  as compared to fy  operating income increased percent  or million 
the company s growth in operating margin was driven primarily by operational cost synergies associated with acquisitions and a favorable mix of business 
during the last three years  as a percentage of revenue  total direct costs were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs such as equipment purchases  subcontract costs and travel expenses 
other direct costs  which are common in our industry  typically are incurred in response to specific client tasks and may vary from period to period 
the largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor during the last three fiscal years is attributable to the internal growth in the company s federal government business both in the dod and federal civilian agencies as well as from the previously mentioned acquisition activities 
other direct costs were million  million and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the year over year increase was primarily the result of increased volume of tasking across system integration  knowledge management and engineering services including the aforementioned acquisitions 
indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
many of these expenses are highly variable and have grown in dollar volume generally in proportion to the growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  indirect costs and selling expenses were percent  percent and percent for fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the decrease in percentage over the prior two fiscal years in primarily from cost synergies associated with acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to fy approximately percent  or million  of the increase was attributable to the intangible amortization of assets acquired in the most recent acquisitions  primarily that of the may  acquisition of the d ig 
the balance of the increase of approximately million was primarily for new capital expenditures and building improvements to support on going business 
in fy  as compared to fy  depreciation and amortization increased by percent  or million primarily for the same reasons as stated above 
the company incurred net interest expense of million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
the majority of this increase was due to a full year of interest costs relating to the company s borrowings in may  of million under its credit facility which was used to finance the purchase of the d ig 
as of june   the company s outstanding borrowing under this line of credit was million 
the company is required to repay a minimum of million annually under the terms of its credit facility 
for fy  the company incurred approximately two months of interest under the credit facility described above 
prior to may  the company was able to fund its operations from proceeds received from its march secondary offering  available cash and equivalents and short term marketable securities  and operating cash flows 
the effective income tax rates in fy  fy and fy  were percent  percent and percent  respectively  which differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to state and local income taxes and certain non deductible expenses 
quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
effects of inflation based on the company s contract mix reported for fy  approximately percent of the company s business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs that are affected by inflation 
approximately percent of revenue is earned under time and material contracts  where labor rates for many of the services provided under time and material contracts  are often fixed for several years 
under certain time and material contracts containing indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity procurement arrangements  the company does adjust labor rates annually as permitted 
the remaining portion of the company s business is fixed price and may span multiple years 
the company generally has been able to price its time and materials and fixed price contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations  and its available credit facilities  have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fund the company s operational needs 
cash flows from operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
between march and may  the principal source of liquidity and capital to fund business acquisitions were the proceeds from the company s march offering of million shares of common stock 
the company raised million from this offering  and during the period between march and may  invested approximately million in the acquisition of eight businesses 
operating cash flows and borrowings under credit facilities were used to supplement the offering proceeds  as necessary  to fund the acquisition of these seven businesses 
to fund the acquisition of the d ig  the company entered into a million credit facility the credit facility  which includes a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility  and a million institutional term loan the term loan 
the initial borrowings under the credit facility were million  of which million was outstanding under the term loan at june  during the year ended june   the company received no advances from borrowings under the revolving facility  and repaid the revolving facility balance of million that was outstanding at june  the revolving facility is a five year  secured facility that permits continuously renewable borrowings of up to million  with annual sublimits on amounts borrowed for acquisitions 
the revolving facility permits one  two  three and six month interest rate options 
the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the facility 
the term loan portion of the credit facility is a seven year secured facility under which principal payments are due in quarterly installments of million at the end of each fiscal quarter through march  and the balance of million is due in full on may  interest rates for both the revolving credit and term loan borrowings are based on libor  or the higher of the prime rate  or federal funds rate  plus applicable margins 
margin and unused fee rates are determined quarterly based on the company s leverage ratios 
the company is expected to operate within certain limits on leverage  net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios throughout the term of the credit facility 
the total costs associated with securing the credit facility were approximately million  and are being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
in may  the company amended the credit facility by reducing the margins applicable to the libor and prime and federal funds rate factors  and in june entered an interest rate swap agreement covering a portion of the outstanding term loan balance 
the company incurred approximately million of fees to amend the credit facility  which has been capitalized and is being amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the company also has amounts due under a lease agreement classified as a capital lease for reporting purposes  amounts due under a mortgage note payable  and maintains a line of credit facility in the united kingdom 
the total amount of reported principal due under the capital lease agreement and mortgage note payable was million at june  the total amount available under the line of credit facility in the uk  which is scheduled to expire in december  is approximately million 
as of june   the company had no borrowings under this facility 
cash and equivalents were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the company s operating cash flow increased to million for fy  as compared to million for the year ended june  the primary drivers behind the higher operating cash flow were the increase in revenues  which in turn was largely due to the may acquisition of the d ig  and improvements in days sales outstanding dso 
dso decreased to days as of june   from days at the end of fy the company used million  and a net million  of cash in investing activities for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the significant decrease in cash used for investing purposes during fy was due primarily to reduced acquisition activity in fy during fy  the company paid million to acquire all of the stock of imaj  ltd 
in the united kingdom  and made a million earn out payment in march related to its acquisition of cms information services  inc in march there were no other acquisitions related payments made during fy the company invested million during fy to acquire businesses including the d ig million  cms information services  inc million  and c cubed corporation million 
purchases of office and computer related equipment of million and million in fy and fy  respectively  accounted for the majority of the remaining funds used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities during fy were offset by cash proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities totaled million during fy  while net cash provided by financing activities totaled million 
during fy  the company obtained million of cash from the initial borrowings under its credit facility arranged to finance the acquisition of the d ig 
the cash provided by borrowings was offset in part by principal repayments of million under the revolving credit facility  and the payment of million of deferred financing costs 
during fy  the company repaid the remaining balance of million of initial borrowings made under the revolving credit facility  and the scheduled million of installments under the term loan 
cash flows from financing activities continued to benefit from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  and purchases of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from these activities totaled million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
these amounts were offset by cash used to purchase stock to fulfill obligations under the employee stock purchase plan 
cash used to acquire stock was million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
on february   the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to sell up to million of common stock  preferred stock  or debt securities from time to time in one or more public offerings 
the registration statement was amended and became effective in may the net proceeds from any sale of the securities would be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes including repayment of debt  share repurchases  and capital expenditures 
the company believes that the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings  cash and cash equivalents on hand  will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on going operations  customary capital expenditures  and other working capital requirements

forward looking statements there are statements made herein which may not address historical facts and  therefore  could be interpreted to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following we depend on contracts with the federal government for a substantial majority of our revenue  and our business could be seriously harmed if the government ceased doing business with us 
we derived percent of our total revenue in fy and percent of our total revenue in fy from federal government contracts  either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor 
we derived percent of our total revenue in fy and percent of our total revenue in fy from contracts with agencies of the dod 
we expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally  with the general services administration  or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the dod  or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired  or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us  our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results could differ materially from those anticipated 
our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in iraq 
beginning in may  press accounts disclosed an internal government report  the taguba report  which contains information regarding the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners 
the taguba report alleges that one of our employees was involved with the alleged mistreatment 
another government report  the jones fay report  alleges that three of our employees  including the one identified in the taguba report  acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in iraq 
the jones fay report recommended that the information in the report regarding each of these employees be forwarded to the general counsel of the united states army for determination of whether each of them should be referred to the united states department of justice for prosecution  as well as forwarded to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action 
our preliminary investigation into these matters had already considered some of the allegations regarding the employees cited in the jones fay report  all of whom are no longer employed by us 
that investigation  however  could not confirm the allegation of abuse contained in the jones fay report concerning one of the former employees and reached a different conclusion than the jones fay report regarding the allegation that another former employee placed a detainee in a stress position and permitted a photograph to be taken 
the third of our former employees named in the jones fay report  whose name was made public at the time of the illegally leaked taguba report  has been under careful consideration and review by us since may despite attempts by our legal counsel to obtain information from the government  to date we have not received any specific information confirming the allegations of wrongdoing made in the taguba report about that former employee 
in fact  our investigation uncovered praise about the high quality of his work from his supervisors and colleagues 
the jones fay report contained other allegations that had not been previously communicated to us  and which we are now pursuing 
our investigation thus far has not produced information that supports these new jones fay report findings 
we have cooperated and will continue to cooperate fully with the government regarding investigations arising out of interrogation services provided in iraq 
in addition  we received a letter from the gsa suspension and debarment official expressing concern that we may have misused a gsa schedule contract vehicle in connection with the contract to provide interrogators and affording us an opportunity to provide information and argument as to why it should remain eligible for further government contracts 
we provided information and presented an explanation to the gsa on june  after its review  gsa sent us a letter stating that it was not necessary to take any formal action to protect the interests of the government that is  the gsa would not suspend or debar us based on these matters 
in the letter  the suspension and debarment official informed us that he had provided the information to the gsa s attorneys for review and would let us know if additional information was needed 
gsa has not requested any further information 
we have never condoned  and will never condone  tolerate or endorse  any illegal or inappropriate behavior on the part of any employee when working on our behalf but we will stand firmly by our employees and their right to be presumed innocent until there is verifiable information confirming that they have been involved in misconduct 
if and when we receive verifiable information indicating any inappropriate or illegal behavior on the part of any employee  we will take swift and appropriate action to redress the matter 
the results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services in iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government 
because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from contracts with the federal government  we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs 
changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance 
a significant decline in government expenditures  or a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies  could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts 
any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
among the factors that could seriously affect our federal government contracting business are changes in federal government programs or requirements  budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally  or specific departments or agencies in particular  and changes in fiscal policies or available funding  including potential governmental shutdowns such as that which occurred during the government s fiscal year  an increase in set asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts  and curtailment of the federal government s use of technology solutions firms 
our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance  and  if lost contracts are not replaced  our operating results may differ materially from those anticipated 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years 
the option periods typically cover more than half of the contract s potential duration 
federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods 
in addition  our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience 
a decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated 
federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us 
federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies  some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts  including allowing the government to cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  claim rights in systems and software developed by us  suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency  impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution  and control or prohibit the export of our data and technology 
if the government terminates a contract for convenience  we may recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination 
if the government terminates a contract for default  we may be unable to recover even those amounts  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
depending on the value of a contract  such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
as is common with government contractors  we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts 
certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that limit our ability to compete for certain related follow on contracts 
for example  when we work on the design of a particular system  we may be precluded from competing for the contract to install that system 
depending upon the value of the matters affected a performance problem or organizational conflict of interest issue that precludes our participation in a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies  our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected 
to facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid 
we may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies  and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process 
if we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period  our business and prospects will be adversely affected 
substantially all of our contracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process 
we expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding 
budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through indefinite delivery indefinite quantity  or id iq  contracts  gsa schedule contracts and other government wide acquisition contracts 
these contracts  some of which are awarded to multiple contractors  have increased competition and pricing pressure  requiring that we make sustained post award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract 
in addition  in consideration of recent publicity regarding the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside their intended scope  both the gsa and the dod have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded 
the net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us 
moreover  even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract  we might not be awarded business because of the federal government s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base 
this competitive bidding process presents a number of risks  including the following we bid on programs before the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns  we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win  we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win  and we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding  and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications  or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 
if we are unable to win particular contracts  we may be foreclosed from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years 
if we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period  our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract  and the termination or non renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients 
many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education  work experience and security clearances 
depending on the level of clearance  security clearances can be difficult and time consuming to obtain 
if we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances  we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them 
to the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract  we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract  which could cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we must comply with a variety of laws and regulations  and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business 
for example  the federal acquisition regulation and the industrial security regulations of the dod and related laws include provisions that allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership  control or influence  require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information 
our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination  loss of security clearances  suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the federal government may reform its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us 
the federal government may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  such as cost accounting standards 
it could also adopt new contracting methods relating to gsa contracts or other government wide contracts  or adopt new socio economic requirements 
these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re competed contracts 
any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy  and  as a result could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
restrictions on or other changes to the federal government s use of service contracts may harm our operating results 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government 
the government may face restrictions from new legislation  regulations or government union pressures  on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors 
any reduction in the government s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 
federal government agencies  including the dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
these agencies review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
they also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
moreover  if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not to comply with requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
therefore  an unfavorable outcome to an audit by the dcaa or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
if a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue 
we derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs 
as a subcontractor or teammate  we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract  and poor performance on the contract could tarnish our reputation  even when we perform as required 
we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our revenue and operating results could differ materially from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services 
we may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog  which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated 
our backlog consists of funded backlog  which is based on amounts actually obligated by a client for payment of goods and services  and unfunded backlog  which is based upon management s estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders  including options  to generate revenue 
our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period  or at all  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract 
for example  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider  meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract 
we also derive revenues from id iq contracts  which do not require the government to purchase a material amount of goods or services under the contract 
action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
without additional congressional appropriations  some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded  which could significantly harm our prospects 
although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years  congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time 
as a result  our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term  and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency 
nevertheless  we estimate our share of the contract values  including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to these contracts  in calculating the amount of our backlog 
because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract  our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may post results that differ materially from those anticipated 
employee misconduct  including security breaches  could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or disbarment from contracting with the federal government 
we may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct  fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation 
misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations  regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts 
many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems 
other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the anti kickback act 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective  and we could face unknown risks or losses 
as a result of employee misconduct  we could face fines and penalties  loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our failure to attract and retain qualified employees  including our senior management team  could adversely affect our business 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively 
our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients  a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees 
accordingly  our employees are our most valuable resource 
competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense  and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees 
there is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources 
our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations  reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs  limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel  we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully 
our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry  particularly with agencies performing classified operations 
the loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our markets are highly competitive  and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources 
the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive 
many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger  better financed and better known companies than we are 
in order to stay competitive in our industry  we must also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences 
if we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors  our revenue may decline 
in addition  our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 
as a result  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can 
there is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation  which may result in the emergence of companies who are better able to compete against us 
the results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future 
in particular  if the federal government does not adopt  or delays adoption of  a budget for each fiscal year beginning on october  or fails to pass a continuing resolution  federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding 
further  the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials 
therefore  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may also fluctuate due to impairment of goodwill charges required by recent changes in accounting standards 
we may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed price basis 
we perform a portion of our engagements on a fixed price basis 
we derived percent of our total revenue in fy and percent of our total revenue in fy from fixed price contracts 
fixed price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance 
in addition  some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices 
many of our engagements are also on a time and material basis 
while these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed price contracts  to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
when making proposals for engagements on a fixed price basis  we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed price contracts  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 
from time to time  unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed price contracts  primarily in connection with state government clients 
on rare occasions  these losses have been significant 
in the event that we encounter such problems in the future  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs 
at june   our backlog included both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed price contracts 
our earnings and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
any systems failures  including network  software or hardware failures  whether caused by us  a third party service provider  unauthorized intruders and hackers  computer viruses  natural disasters  power shortages or terrorist attacks  could cause loss of data  interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients 
in addition  the failure or disruption of our mail  communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and  as a result  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the systems and networks that we maintain for our clients  although highly redundant in their design  could also fail 
if a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions  we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination 
our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and  as a result  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
we may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates 
one of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions 
through acquisitions  we have expanded our base of federal government clients  increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing clients 
we may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions 
without acquisitions  we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy  including increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions  our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process  including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations  such as the federal acquisition regulation and health  safety and environmental laws  or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers  and acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future 
the integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
these integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds  the transition to new information systems  coordination of geographically dispersed organizations  loss of key employees of acquired companies  and reconciliation of different corporate cultures 
for these or other reasons  we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies 
moreover  any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost savings that we anticipated 
any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations  our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients 
a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies and or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor 
a subcontractor s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders 
depending upon the level of problem experienced  such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables 
we depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow  provide working capital  pay debt and continue our business operations 
if the federal government  any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason  our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons  including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget 
some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do  which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed 
if we experience difficulties collecting receivables it could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our global networks and other business commitments require our employees to travel to potentially dangerous places  which may result in injury or other negative impact to key employees 
our domestic business involves the maintenance of global networks and provision of other services that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world 
these countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest  and in some cases war or terrorism 
certain senior level employees or executives are  on occasion  part of the teams deployed to provide services in these countries 
as a result  it is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm  or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments 
it is also possible that we will encounter unexpected costs in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives for reasons beyond our control 
these problems could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property 
although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations  this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information 
in addition  we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights  trademarks or other proprietary information  our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
we face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations 
our international operations consist of our uk based business which conducts the majority of its business in the united kingdom 
our international operations comprised approximately of our revenue in fy and of our revenue in fy our uk based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country 
these risks include fluctuations in the value of the british pound  longer payment cycles  changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative  regulatory  economic or political changes 
our uk based operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial  as opposed to a government contracting  business  including the effects of general economic conditions in the united kingdom on the telecommunications  computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors 
our revenue from this business grew during fy over revenue from such business in fy as a result of the continued recovery of the uk economy and the strengthening of the british pound 
while we are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us  our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful 
other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are a continued decline in the economy of the united kingdom  difficulties relating to managing our business internationally  and multiple tax structures 
any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the interest rates on both the institutional term loan and the revolving credit facility portion of the company s credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company has the ability to manage these fluctuations in part  through interest rate swaps 
a percent change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in the company s interest expense fluctuating by approximately million for the year ended june  approximately percent and percent of the company s total revenues in fy and fy  respectively  were derived from customers of our international operations  primarily in the united kingdom 
the company s practice in its international operations is to negotiate contracts in the same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as of june  the company had approximately million in cash held in pounds sterling in the united kingdom 
this allows the company to better utilize its cash resources on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
