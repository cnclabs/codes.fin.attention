item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the section factors that may affect future operating results at the end of this item  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  sell or hold our common stock 
overview we are a leading provider of technology and services for digital video recorders  or dvrs  a rapidly growing consumer electronics category 
our subscription based tivo service improves home entertainment by providing consumers with an easy way to record  watch  and control television 
the tivo service also offers the television industry a platform for advertisers  content delivery  and audience measurement research 
key elements of our strategy revolve around continued investment in technology  research and development  and innovation  extending and protecting our intellectual property and continuing to promote and leverage the tivo brand  as well as working to improve profitability  market share  and financial strength 
our financial strength and ability to adapt to the current market and economic conditions are dependent in part on our generation of cash flow  effective management of working capital  funding commitments  and other obligations as well as the growth of our business 
executive overview and outlook during the fiscal year ended january   we continued to show strong growth in our overall subscription base and subscription revenues 
during this period  we experienced increased subscription growth from the retail distribution channel  with the mix of our net new tivo service subscriptions shifting towards directv with tivo subscriptions 
additionally  we launched a one year program to increase our subscription acquisition activities with a focus on growing tivo owned subscriptions 
tivo owned subscription additions in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year were  which were nearly double the subscription additions from the quarter ended january  for the fiscal year ending january  we plan to lower our total subscription acquisition costs while achieving growth in our subscription base 
we expect to see progressive improvements in profitability and cash flow from operating activities throughout the fiscal year 
on march   we announced a new development  distribution  and licensing agreement with comcast 
the following table sets forth selected information as of our fiscal year ended january    and fiscal year ended january  in thousands service and technology revenues net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses loss from operations cash flows from operating activities service and technology revenues 
our service and technology revenues increased million or during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the growth in our subscription base of million subscriptions during the fiscal year ended january  net revenues 
our net revenues increased by million or during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we added million net new tivo owned and directv subscriptions in the last three years 
our increased investment in subscription acquisition activities  such as consumer rebates  during the fiscal year offset the overall growth in our service  technology  and hardware revenues that resulted from the increased volume of subscriptions added during the year 
cost of revenues 
our total costs of revenues  which includes cost of service revenues  cost of technology revenues  and cost of hardware revenues  increased by million or during the fiscal year ended january  the cost of service and technology revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased by million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the cost of hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased by million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 

table of contents 
index to financial statements operating expenses 
our operating expenses  including our research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  increased million or during the year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating expenses for fiscal year was primarily attributable to increases in our investments in research and development and subscription acquisition activities 
cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flows from operating activities decreased by million or by nearly four times as much as compared to the same prior year period 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics discussed below in order to evaluate our operational strategies  allocate resources  and maximize the financial performance of our business 
management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
subscriptions 
management reviews this metric  and believes it might be useful to investors  in order to evaluate tivo s relative position in the marketplace and to forecast future potential service revenues 
below is a table that details the growth in our subscription base during the past eight quarters 
the tivo owned lines refer to subscriptions sold directly by tivo to customers who have tivo enabled dvrs and products  including those manufactured currently by tivo  humax  pioneer  and toshiba 
the directv lines refer to subscriptions sold by directv to customers who have integrated directv satellite receivers with tivo service 
directv reports a cumulative subscription number to us on a monthly basis 
additionally  we provide a breakdown of the percent of tivo owned subscriptions for which consumers pay a recurring fee  as opposed to a one time product lifetime fee 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase service for the lifetime of an individual tivo enabled dvr 
we recognize revenue from product lifetime subscriptions over four years 
three months ended subscriptions in thousands jan  oct  jul  apr  jan  oct  jul  apr  subscription net additions tivo owned directv total subscription net additions cumulative subscriptions tivo owned directv total cumulative subscriptions of tivo owned cumulative subscriptions paying recurring fees we define a subscription as a contract referencing a tivo enabled dvr for which i a customer has paid for the tivo service and ii service is not canceled 
we offer a product lifetime subscription  under which consumers can purchase a subscription that is valid for the lifetime of a particular dvr 
we count these as subscriptions until both of the following conditions are met i we reach the end of the four year period we use to recognize lifetime subscription revenues  and ii the related dvr has not made contact to the tivo service within the prior six month period 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for defining subscriptions and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
as of january   we had  product lifetime subscriptions  or approximately of our total installed subscription base  that had exceeded the four year period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues 
this represents an increase of from the prior quarter 
we continue to incur costs of services for these subscriptions without corresponding revenue 
we have also offered to some of our consumer electronics partners  on a limited basis  a reduced functionality version of the tivo service called tivo basic that does not involve a fee to consumers 
dvrs with the tivo basic service that have not upgraded to the tivo service are not included in our subscription totals 
tivo owned churn rate 
management reviews this metric  and believes it might be useful to investors  in order to evaluate our ability to retain existing subscribers by providing compelling services that are competitive in the market 
management believes factors such as service enhancements  higher customer satisfaction  and improved customer support  may lower this metric 
conversely  management believes factors such as increased competition  increased price sensitivity  and the impact of our product lifetime subscription offering  may cause our tivo owned churn rate to increase 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we define the tivo owned churn rate as the average tivo owned subscription including both monthly and product lifetime subscriptions cancellations per month in the period divided by the average of tivo owned subscriptions for the period 
we calculate average subscriptions by adding the average subscriptions for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period 
we calculate average subscriptions for each month by adding the beginning and ending subscriptions for the month and dividing by two 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating churn and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
the following table presents our tivo owned churn rate information fiscal year ended january  in thousands tivo owned subscription cancellations for the year average tivo owned subscriptions for the year annual churn rate number of months tivo owned churn rate per month the tivo owned churn rate per month was for the fiscal year ended january   compared to per month in the same prior year period 
we believe most of the increase was due to the timing of our product lifetime subscriptions 
we count as churn those product lifetime subscriptions that have both reached the end of the four year revenue recognition period and whose dvrs have not contacted the tivo service within the prior six months 
since volume growth of the tivo service began in late and early  we are now experiencing the initial effects of churn from these product lifetime subscriptions 
the tivo owned churn rate per month of  for the fiscal year ended january   is comprised of attributable to these product lifetime subscriptions and from cancellations of recurring subscriptions 
conversely  we do not count as churn product lifetime subscriptions that have not reached the end of the four year revenue recognition period  regardless of whether such subscriptions continue to contact the tivo service 
we anticipate our tivo owned churn rate will increase in future periods as a result of increased churn from these product lifetime subscriptions and increased competition in the marketplace 
subscription acquisition cost sac 
management reviews this metric  and believes it might be useful to investors  in order to evaluate trends in the efficiency of our marketing programs and subscription acquisition strategies 
we define sac as our total acquisition costs divided by tivo owned subscription gross additions 
we define total acquisition costs as the sum of sales and marketing expenses  rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel  minus hardware gross margin defined as hardware revenues less cost of hardware revenues 
we do not include directv subscription gross additions in our calculation of sac because we incur limited or no acquisition costs for new directv subscriptions 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating total acquisition costs or sac and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
months ended january  in thousands  except sac sales and marketing expenses rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel hardware revenues cost of hardware revenues total acquisition costs tivo owned subscription gross additions subscription acquisition cost sac during the twelve months ended january   our total acquisition costs were million  and sac was comparatively  total acquisition costs for the twelve months ended january  and were million and million  respectively and sac was and  respectively 
sac increased by or for the twelve months ended january  compared to the prior year period due primarily to increased rebate expense and payments to retailers 
as a result of the seasonal nature of our subscription growth  our sac varies significantly during the year 
management primarily reviews this metric on an annual basis due to the timing difference between our recognition of promotional program expense and the subsequent addition of the related subscription acquisition 
for example  historically we have incurred increased sales and marketing expense during our third quarter in anticipation of new subscriptions that may be added during the fourth quarter and in subsequent periods in addition to those added during the third quarter 

table of contents 
index to financial statements average revenue per subscription arpu 
management reviews this metric  and believes it might be useful to investors  in order to evaluate the potential of our subscription base to generate revenues from a variety of sources  including subscription fees  advertising  and audience measurement research 
arpu does not include rebates  revenue share and other payments to channel that reduce our gaap revenues  and as a result you should not use arpu as a substitute for measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
management believes it is useful to consider this metric excluding the costs associated with rebates  revenue share and other payments to channel because of the discretionary nature of these expenses and because management believes these expenses are more appropriately monitored as part of sac 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating arpu and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
we calculate arpu per month for tivo owned subscriptions by subtracting directv related service revenues which includes directv subscription service revenues and directv related advertising revenues from our total reported service revenues and dividing by the number of months in the period 
we then divide by average tivo owned subscriptions for the period  calculated as described above for churn rate 
the following table shows this calculation and reconciles arpu for tivo owned subscriptions to our reported service and technology revenues fiscal year ended january  in thousands service and technology revenues less technology revenues total service revenues less directv related service revenues tivo owned related service revenues average tivo owned revenues per month average tivo owned per month subscriptions tivo owned arpu per month tivo owned arpu per month for the fiscal year ended january  increased from fiscal years and  to from from  respectively 
the increase was largely a result of the shift in the mix of tivo owned subscriptions from lifetime subscriptions to monthly subscriptions 
we calculate arpu per month for directv subscriptions by first subtracting tivo owned related service revenues which includes tivo owned subscription service revenues and tivo owned related advertising revenues from our total reported service revenues 
then we divide average revenues per month for directv related service revenues by average subscriptions for the period 
the following table shows this calculation and reconciles arpu for directv subscriptions to service and technology revenues fiscal year ended january  in thousands service and technology revenues less technology revenues total service revenues less tivo owned related service revenues directv related service revenues average directv revenues per month average directv subscriptions directv arpu per month arpu per month for directv subscriptions for the fiscal year ended january  decreased from prior fiscal years to from and  respectively 
we expect arpu per month for directv subscriptions to decline further as new directv subscriptions generally involve limited or no acquisition costs  lower recurring expenses  and lower subscription revenue 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we base our discussion and analysis on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles as described in item note nature of operations in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and related 
table of contents 
index to financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this analysis form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates  see item note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
recognition period for lifetime subscriptions revenues 
tivo offers a product lifetime subscription option for the life of the dvr for a one time  upfront payment 
we recognize subscription revenues from lifetime subscriptions ratably over a four year period  based on our estimate of the useful life of these dvrs 
as of january   we had  product lifetime subscriptions  or of our total installed subscription base  that had exceeded the four year period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues 
if the useful life of the recorder were shorter or longer than four years  we would recognize revenues earlier or later 
our product is still relatively new  and as we gather more user information  we might revise this estimated life 
engineering professional services project cost estimates 
for engineering professional services that are essential to the functionality of the software or involve significant customization or modification  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  as described in statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of the project  an input method 
in general  these contracts are long term and complex 
we believe we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasting of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance  projecting cost to complete  tracking progress of costs incurred to date  and projecting the remaining effort to complete the project 
costs included in engineering professional services are labor  materials  and overhead related to the specific activities that are required for the project 
costs related to general infrastructure or platform development are not included in the engineering professional services project cost estimates 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
in some cases  we have accepted engineering professional services contracts that were expected to be losses at the time of acceptance in order to gain experience in developing a new technology that could be used in future products and services 
provisions for all losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
using different cost estimates  or different methods of measuring progress to completion  engineering professional services revenues and expenses may produce materially different results 
a favorable change in estimates in a period could result in additional revenue and profit  and an unfavorable change in estimates could result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that would be borne solely by tivo 
consumer rebate redemption rates 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendors products  we record an estimated potential liability for our consumer rebate program that is based on the percentage of customers that were reimbursed for the rebate for similar past programs and adjust estimates to consider actual redemptions 
the most recent programs have ranged from to averaging 
as of january   we recorded an accrual of million for rebates 
based on our results for fiscal year  a one percentage point deviation in our redemption rebate estimate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of  upon completion of consumer rebate programs  any unredeemed consumer rebate expense will be reversed 
the consumer rebates are recognized as rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel in our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of inventory 
we maintain a finished goods inventory of tivo enabled dvrs throughout the year 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
we base write downs to inventories on changes in selling price of a completed unit 
estimates are based upon current facts and circumstances and are determined in aggregate and evaluated on total pool basis 
we continually monitor inventory valuation and purchase commitments for potential losses in net realizable value 
estimates used in complex agreements 
we have a number of complex transactions and commitments 
many of these transactions involve multiple elements and types of consideration  including cash  debt  equity  and services 
for example  our relationship with directv has historically included subscription revenue share expense  engineering professional services revenue  common stock and warrants issued for services  and various platform subsidies 
many of our arrangements require us to make estimations for the valuation of non cash expenses  such as warrants issued for services  which must be assigned a value using financial models that require us to estimate certain parameters 
we have utilized our best estimate of the value of the various elements in accounting for these transactions 
had alternative assumptions been used  the values obtained may have been materially different 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf includes new guidance 
table of contents 
index to financial statements for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf has been temporarily deferred by the fasb  but the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective for our fiscal annual consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  additional disclosures as required by eitf are included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas 
fas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
statement r must be adopted in the first interim period beginning after june  we expect to adopt the standard by august   the beginning of our third quarter 
statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented  or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating which of the two methods we will adopt 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position based on our current share based awards to employees 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model used to value the options and other variables 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the stock compensation disclosure included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenues 
our net revenues for the fiscal years ended january    and as a percentage of total net revenues were as follows fiscal year ended january  revenues in thousands  except percentages service revenues technology revenues hardware revenues rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel net revenues change from prior fiscal year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of the total service revenues and technology revenues for the fiscal years ended january    and  million  million and million  respectively  were generated from related parties 
service revenues 
service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased or million over the service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  this increase was primarily due to the growth in our subscription base 
service revenues for the year ended january  were million  higher than service revenues for the year ended january  during the year ended january   we activated million new subscriptions to the tivo service bringing the total installed subscription base to above million as of january   nearly five times greater than the installed base as of january  consumer demand for tivo enabled dvr and dvd products was driven by broad availability and strong support in the retail channel  consumer rebate programs  and increased consumer awareness of tivo 
we intend to generate continued tivo owned subscription growth by managing our relationships with leading retailers like best buy  circuit city  target  and others 
we anticipate fiscal year will have continued service revenue growth as our subscription base grows 
revenues from advertising and research services included in service revenues  while not material during these periods  have increased 
technology revenues 
in the fiscal year ended january   we derived of our net revenues  or million  from licensing and engineering professional services 
technology revenues for the fiscal year ended january  were lower than the same period last year due to our decision to pursue fewer licensing agreements in the fiscal year additionally  in the quarter ended october  we reduced our technology revenues by approximately  after we determined it was unlikely we would receive estimated revenues from one customer 
one related party customer generated million  million and million of technology revenues or   and of net revenues for the fiscal years ended january    and respectively 
a different customer generated million and million of technology revenues  or and of net revenues for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we recognized million of licensing and engineering professional services revenue with little corresponding costs from two customers due to the one time recognition of revenues for two projects for which we have no further obligations 
hardware revenues 
hardware revenues  net of allowance for sales returns  for the fiscal year ended january  were of our net revenues 
for the fiscal years ended january    and  one retail customer generated million  million  and million of hardware revenues  or   and of net revenues  respectively 
although volume of units sold increased for the fiscal year ended january  by from the year ago period  hardware revenue from these units was lower per unit as we decreased our sales price per unit by nearly to both our retail customers and consumers 
rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel 
we recognize certain marketing related payments as a reduction of revenues on our statements of operations 
rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel increased for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the respective prior fiscal year due to higher rebates  revenue share  and market development funds paid to retailers 
the primary contributor to the increase in rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel was consumer rebate expenses 
consumer rebate expenses were million and million  respectively  for fiscal years ended january  and fiscal year expenses reflected the reversal of the rebate accrual for rebate programs that ended on april  other significant contributors to the increase were revenue share and market development funds paid to retailers 
these marketing related payments increased by million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the same prior year period 
we expect our fiscal year payments to be lower as a result of decreased investment in subscription acquisition activities 
cost of service and technology revenues 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except percentages cost of service revenues cost of technology revenues cost of service and technology revenues change from prior fiscal year percentage of service and technology revenues costs of service and technology revenues consist primarily of telecommunication and network expenses  employee salaries  call center  and other expenses related to providing the tivo service 
additional expenses included are expenses related to providing engineering professional services to our customers  including employee salaries and related costs  as well as prototyping and other material costs 
cost of service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased or by million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
total customer care center expenses increased by or by million compared to the same prior year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements period due to an increased level of staffing as a result of tivo s increased focus on issues of customer care and retention 
we expect to continue to increase customer care center expenses for fiscal year as we strive to continue to improve customer retention 
additionally  technology license fees increased by or by million for the fiscal year ended january  also  telecommunication and network expenses related to providing the tivo service increased by or by million for the fiscal year ended january  cost of service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased modestly compared to the prior fiscal year 
cost of technology revenues decreased by for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior year period 
this decrease was largely due to fewer contracts requiring deployment of engineers from research and development activities 
additionally contributing to the decrease were lower provisions for losses on contracts related to providing engineering professional services to customers under agreements for which expenses exceeded the budgeted revenues 
as a result of the decline in technology revenues and an adjustment to one contract s cost estimate  technology revenues gross margin was million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
cost of technology revenues increased by or million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to increased expenses related to providing engineering professional services to two customers under agreements for which expenses exceeded the budgeted revenues 
cost of hardware revenues 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except percentages cost of hardware revenues change from prior fiscal year nm percentage of hardware revenues hardware gross margin hardware gross margin as a percentage of hardware revenues costs of hardware revenues include all product costs associated with the tivo enabled dvrs we distribute and sell  including manufacturing related overhead and personnel  warranty  certain licensing  order fulfillment  and freight costs 
we engage a contract manufacturer to build tivo enabled dvrs 
we have engaged in the manufacturing and the sale of hardware as a means to grow our service revenues and  as a result  do not intend to generate significant gross margins from these hardware sales 
the increase in sales volume was the primary reason for the increase in the cost of hardware revenues 
cost of hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  and increased and  respectively  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the increased overall sales volume of dvrs sold to retailers during this period as compared to the prior year period 
we believe the volume has increased because of our significant investment during this fiscal year in our subscription acquisition activities 
our hardware gross margin has continued to decline due to price reductions introduced in fiscal year and the shift in the mix of products to lower average selling price products 
we expect that the cost of hardware revenues will change as sales volumes change 

table of contents 
index to financial statements research and development expenses 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses change from prior fiscal year percentage of net revenues our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  related expenses  and consulting fees 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended january  increased over the prior fiscal year period primarily due to increased salary expenses of million 
the increase is related to an increase in engineering headcount by employees from the fiscal year ended january  and because fewer engineers were redeployed from research and development activities to engineering professional services activities 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended january  increased over the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased salary expenses related to an increase in engineering headcount of employees 
sales and marketing expenses 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses change from prior fiscal year percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses  media advertising  public relations activities  special promotions  trade shows  and the production of product related items  including collateral and videos 
sales and marketing expenses also include expenses that consist of cash and non cash charges related primarily to agreements with related parties 
our sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ending january  were significantly higher than for the fiscal year ended january  due to our increased investment in subscription acquisition activities 
the largest contributor to this increased investment in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended january   in terms of absolute dollars  was our advertising expense  including print and radio advertising  which increased by million 
for the fiscal year ended january  total advertising expense was  another contributor to the fiscal year increase was public relations and event expense that increased by or by million from the fiscal year ended january  during the fiscal year ended january   revenue share expense decreased by or million  compared to fiscal year this decrease was a result of renegotiated contracts with directv and lower manufacturing volumes by related party consumer electronic manufacturers 
revenue share is calculated as an agreed upon percentage of revenue for a specified group of tivo subscriptions 
during the fiscal year ended january   million was non cash expense related to the remaining unamortized portion of the prepaid marketing expense associated with the june investment agreement with aol which was terminated by the funds release agreement in april the remainder of these prepaid marketing expenses was fully amortized on a straight line basis during the fiscal year ended january  another contributor to the reduction of sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year was non related party subsidy expense that decreased million from the prior fiscal year 
this marketing commitment ended prior to the three months ended april  additionally  for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior fiscal year  partner co marketing expenses decreased by million due to decreased activity 
general and administrative expenses

table of contents 
index to financial statements general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses for executive  administrative  accounting  information systems  customer operations personnel  facility costs  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january  increased compared to the same prior year period 
the increase was primarily due to salaries and wages that increased  or million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to an increase in accounting and information system headcount of employees 
in connection with our ongoing lawsuits  we have expensed million for the fiscal year ended january  for legal expenses in connection with the sony patent infringement case 
we expect to continue to incur legal expenses for all pending lawsuits  including material amounts related to the sony patent infringement case 
we also expect we will begin to incur material expenses for the echostar communications patent infringement case in the future 
we expect these increased expenses will likely adversely affect our results of operations  by increasing our operating expenses  adversely impacting our financial position  and diverting additional cash flows to non revenue generating activities 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased legal expenses of million for ongoing and settled lawsuits 
interest income 
interest income resulting from cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts and short term investments for the fiscal year ended january  tripled the amount of the prior fiscal year 
the increase was a result of significantly higher levels of cash during the year 
interest income for the fiscal year was largely a result of the receipt of a one time payment of million in interest earned on the restricted cash from the agreement with aol was released from the escrow account to us in april interest expense and other 
interest expense and other primarily consists of cash and non cash charges related to interest expense paid for coupon interest expense on the convertible notes and interest expense paid to our consumer electronics manufacturers according to negotiated deferred payment schedules 
interest expense and other for the fiscal year ended january  decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to fewer convertible notes payable that were due interest payments 
non cash interest expense for the same period included million attributable to the accelerated accretion of the discount due to conversions or redemptions of the remaining noteholders and million attributable to the amortization of the discount pertaining to the value of the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes payable  the amortization of the issuance of warrants to noteholders  and the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the conversion of the notes of the convertible notes payable  respectively 
non cash interest expense for the fiscal year ended january  included million attributable to the accelerated accretion of the discount due to the conversion of convertible notes held by nbc and million from the amortization of the discount pertaining to the value of the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes  the amortization of the issuance of warrants to noteholders  and the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the conversion of other convertible notes 
during fiscal year ended january  non cash interest expense was million attributable to the amortization of the discount pertaining to the value of the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes  the amortization of the issuance of warrants to noteholders  the value of the additional shares resulting from the temporary incentive conversion price reduction  and the amortization of debt issuance costs for the convertible notes

our cash resources are subject  in part  to the amount and timing of cash received from subscriptions  licensing and engineering professional services customers  and hardware customers 
at january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
for the fiscal year ending january  we plan to focus on improving profitability and cash flow from operations throughout the year 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations  and our revolving line of credit facility with silicon valley bank represent sufficient resources to fund operations  capital expenditures  and working capital needs through the next twelve months 
statement of cash flows discussion our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operations and by financing activities 
although we currently anticipate these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash needs through the next twelve months  we may require or choose to obtain additional financing 
our ability to obtain financing will depend  among other things  on our development efforts  business plans  operating performance  and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
please refer to factors that may affect future operating results below for further discussion 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities fiscal year ended january  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities the increase in net cash used in operating activities from fiscal year to was primarily attributable to the increase in net loss incurred in fiscal year compared to the primary change in net loss was an increase in sales and marketing expense of million related to our increased advertising activities and consumer rebate expenses of million 
the increase in net cash used in operations was partially offset by a decrease in payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million during fiscal year as compared to the same prior year period and by an increase in revenues from subscriptions 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities from fiscal year to was primarily attributable to the reduction in net loss incurred in fiscal year compared to the primary change in net loss was continued reductions in sales and marketing expenses for revenue share and subsidy expense 
also contributing to the reduction in net loss was increased revenue from subscriptions 
the decrease in net cash used in operations was partially offset by the decrease in non cash interest expense in the fiscal year because of fewer conversions of convertible notes payable 
non cash interest expense included million attributable to the accelerated accretion of the discount due to the conversion of convertible notes by nbc during fiscal year cash from deferred revenues has increased because we sell product lifetime subscriptions and receive up front license and engineering professional services payments 
these activities cause us to receive cash payments in advance of providing the services for which the cash is received  which we recognize as deferred revenues 
net cash used in investing activities the increases in net cash used in investing activities for fiscal years  and were primarily attributable to increased purchases and sales of short term investments 
additionally  we increased purchases of property and equipment to support our business 
during the fiscal year  we acquired intangible assets in exchange for the issuance of common stock because of the strangeberry inc acquisition and in exchange for the issuance of common stock for acquisition of patent rights

depending upon market conditions  we may issue securities under this or future registration statements 
convertible senior notes due on august   we closed a private placement of million in face value of convertible senior notes due and received cash proceeds of approximately million from investors 
in addition  we received non cash consideration of million in the form of advertising and promotional services from discovery communications  inc and the national broadcasting company  inc  who were existing stockholders 
debt issuance costs were approximately million  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
of the total proceeds of million  million was recorded as prepaid advertising and promotional services 
as part of the transaction  we paid million in october to nbc for advertising that ran during the period that began october  and ended march  during the period beginning on december  and ending on january   we temporarily reduced the conversion price of our convertible notes from to per share pursuant to the indenture governing the notes in order to induce early conversions 
during this period  million in principal amount of the million outstanding principal amount of the notes was converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the reduced conversion price resulted in  shares of common stock being issued in addition to the  shares of common stock that would have been issuable upon conversion of the million principal amount of notes at per share 
on november   we notified by mail the registered holders of our convertible senior notes due that we elected to exercise our option to redeem all remaining outstanding notes 
as of october and november   the aggregate principal amount of the remaining outstanding notes was  pursuant to our notice and the terms of the indenture  the notes were either converted by the noteholders into common stock on or before january  at the effective conversion price of per share or redeemed by us on january  at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the notes plus accrued  but unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
there were no notes outstanding following january  revolving line of credit facility with silicon valley bank 
on june   we renewed our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank for an additional two years  whereby silicon valley bank agreed to increase the amount of the revolving line of credit it extends to us from a maximum of million to million 
the first amendment to the silicon valley bank loan and security agreement also replaces the borrowing base requirement with a requirement that we maintain a certain pre determined tangible net worth as defined in the first amendment 
the line of credit remains secured by a first priority security interest on all of our assets except for our intellectual property 
however  our agreement with silicon valley bank also includes a negative pledge such that we will not  among other things except in accordance with certain enumerated exceptions  sell  transfer  assign  mortgage  pledge  lease  grant a security interest in  or encumber any of our intellectual property without the consent of silicon valley bank 
the line of credit now bears interest at the greater of prime or per annum  but in an event of default that is continuing  the interest rate becomes above the rate effective immediately before the event of default 
the first amendment also allows us to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in which we may commit to purchase from or sell to silicon valley bank a set amount of foreign currency 
the loan and security agreement includes  among other terms and conditions  limitations on our ability to dispose of our assets  merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity  create  incur  assume or be liable for indebtedness other than certain types of permitted indebtedness  including existing and subordinated debt and debt to trade creditors incurred in the ordinary course of business  create  incur or allow any lien on any of our property or assign any right to receive income except for certain permitted liens  make investments  pay dividends  or make distributions  and contains a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios 
at january   we were in compliance with these covenants and had million outstanding under the line of credit 
the outstanding balance was repaid in its entirety in february the line of credit terminates and any and all borrowings are due on june   but may be terminated earlier by us without penalty upon written notice and repayment of all amounts borrowed

index to financial statements contractual obligations as of january   we had contractual obligations to make the following cash payments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years over years in thousands operating leases bank line of credit purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments as of january   were as follows total less than year years years over years in thousands standby letter of credit total commercial commitments off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we generally do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
accordingly  our operating results  financial condition  and cash flows are not subject to off balance sheet risks associated with these types of arrangements 
we did not have any of these types of off balance sheet arrangements at january  factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
we have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant net losses and have had substantial negative cash flows 
during the fiscal years ended january    and  our net loss was million  million  and million  respectively 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
the size of these net losses depends in part on our subscription revenues and on our expenses 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
consequently  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues  increase our subscription acquisition cost  and hinder our ability to generate new subscriptions 
the dvr market is rapidly evolving and we expect to face significant competition 
moreover  the market for in home entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
as a result of this intense competition  we could incur increased subscription acquisition costs that could adversely affect our ability to reach sustained profitability in the future 
if new technologies render the dvr market obsolete  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the dvr market are brand recognition and awareness  functionality  ease of use  availability  and pricing 
we currently see two primary categories of dvr competitors dvrs offered by consumer electronics companies  and dvrs offered by cable and satellite operators 
within each of these two categories  the competition can be further segmented into those offering what we define as basic dvr functionality  and those offering enhanced dvr functionality 
basic dvr functionality includes no or limited program guide data and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements vcr like controls with manual timeslot based recordings  usually with no dvr service fee after the consumer purchases the enabling hardware 
the tivo basic service offered on select tivo enabled dvd recorders made by toshiba and pioneer is an example of basic dvr functionality 
enhanced dvr functionality includes rich program guide data and enhanced scheduling and personalization features  and may or may not require a dvr service fee 
the tivo service  required for most tivo enabled dvrs  and offered as an upgrade for select tivo enabled dvd recorders made by toshiba and pioneer  are examples of enhanced dvr functionality 
the tivo service  required for most tivo enabled dvrs  and offered as an upgrade for select tivo enabled dvd recorders made by toshiba and pioneer  are examples of enhanced dvr functionality 
consumer electronics competitors 
we compete against several types of products with basic or enhanced dvr functionality offered by consumer electronics companies 
these products record an analog television signal output from a cable or satellite set top box  analog cable feed  or antenna 
standalone dvrs and hard drive equipped dvd recorders  tvs and game consoles replaytv continues to offer standalone dvrs with enhanced dvr functionality in limited retail distribution 
several consumer electronics companies  including panasonic and sony  produce dvd recorders with hard drives 
in addition  several consumer electronics companies  including rca and toshiba  offer tvs that can connect to external hard drives to allow for recording of television programming 
some of these tvs offer cablecard functionality  allowing the receipt of encrypted digital cable programming without the need for a digital cable set top box 
in general  these hard drive equipped dvd recorders and tvs do not require dvr service fees and offer basic dvr functionality 
in the future  companies such as sony and microsoft could incorporate dvr technology into their video game consoles 
personal computers with dvr software microsoft s windows xp media center edition contains expanded digital media features including enhanced dvr functionality 
pc manufacturers including dell and hewlett packard offer pcs running this microsoft software 
satellite and cable dvr competitors 
we compete against cable and satellite set top boxes that integrate basic or enhanced dvr functionality into multi channel receivers 
satellite echostar offers a range of dvr models  including standard definition and high definition models  most of which offer dual tuner capabilities 
certain models can output signals to multiple tvs within the household 
certain models now offer name based recordings instead of timeslot base recordings 
directv has announced plans to introduce a competing dvr service this year 
cable scientific atlanta sells explorer integrated digital cable dvr set top box to cable operators 
motorola sells the dct and dct integrated digital cable dvr set top boxes to cable operators 
these products combine digital and analog cable reception with dvr functionality  some versions offer dual tuner and or high definition capabilities 
in addition  scientific atlanta and motorola have announced plans to build integrated cable dvrs for cable operator charter communications and others using moxi media center software from digeo 
in november  comcast and microsoft announced that comcast would deploy microsoft tv foundation edition software to more than million comcast subscribers in washington state 
for subscribers with cable dvr set top boxes  this microsoft software supports dual tuner enhanced dvr functionality 
us cable operators are currently deploying server based video on demand vod technology from seachange  concurrent  and others  which could potentially evolve into competition 
server based vod relies on content servers located within the cable operator s central head end that stream video across the network to a digital cable set top box within the consumer s home 
cable operators can use vod to deliver movies  television shows  and other content to consumers 
consumers can watch this programming on demand  with vcr like pausing and rewinding capabilities 
operators can charge consumers for access to vod content on a per transaction or monthly subscription basis  or can offer content without charge 
to the extent that cable operators offer regular television programming as part of their vod offerings  consumers have an alternate means of watching time shifted shows besides dvrs 
licensing fees 
our licensing revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements with our consumer electronics and service provider customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in addition  we face competition from companies such as microsoft  gemstar  opentv  nds  d m holdings  digeo  ucentric  gotuit  and wire who have created competing digital video recording technologies 
such companies may offer more economically attractive licensing agreements to service providers and manufacturers of dvrs 
established competition for advertising budgets 
digital video recorder services  in general  and tivo  specifically  also compete with traditional advertising media such as print  radio  and television for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services  in general  and tivo specifically  as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to promotions on the tivo service 
in addition  advertisers may not 
table of contents 
index to financial statements support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology s ability to fast forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness of general television advertising 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture  distribute  and supply critical components and services for the dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we may be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations 
the tivo service is enabled through the use of a dvr made available by us through a third party contract manufacturer and a limited number of other third parties 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of key components for the dvrs 
we do not control the time and resources that these third parties devote to our business 
we cannot be sure that these parties will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue  cost savings  or other benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties 
if any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner  we may be delayed or prevented from commercializing our products and services 
because our relationships with these parties are non exclusive  they may also support products and services that compete directly with us  or offer similar or greater support to our competitors 
any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize our products and services 
this outcome would harm our ability to compete effectively and achieve increased market acceptance and brand recognition 
in addition  we face the following risks in relying on these third parties if our manufacturing relationships are not successful  we may be unable to satisfy demand for our products and services 
we manufacture dvrs that enable the tivo service through a third party contract manufacturer 
we also have entered and anticipate entering into agreements with consumer electronics manufacturers to manufacture and distribute dvrs that enable the tivo service 
however  we have no minimum volume commitments from any manufacturer 
the ability of our consumer electronics manufacturers to reach sufficient production volume of dvrs to satisfy anticipated demand is subject to delays and unforeseen problems such as defects  shortages of critical components and cost overruns 
moreover  they will require substantial lead times to manufacture anticipated quantities of the dvrs that enable the tivo service 
delays  product shortages  and other problems could impair the retail distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract subscriptions 
in addition  the loss of a manufacturer would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources of manufacturing  which we may be unable to do and which could prove time consuming and expensive 
although we expect to continue to contract with additional consumer electronics companies for the manufacture of dvrs in the future  we may be unable to establish additional relationships on acceptable terms 
we are dependent on single suppliers for several key components and services 
if these suppliers fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our products and services to our customers on time 
we currently rely on sole suppliers for a number of the key components used in the tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service 
for example broadcom is the sole supplier of the mpeg encoder and decoder semiconductor devices  amtek is the sole supplier of the chassis  and atmel is the sole supplier of the secure microcontroller semiconductor device 
because we do not require customized components from broadcom  amtek  or atmel  we do not have binding supply agreements with these suppliers 
therefore  they are not contractually obligated to supply us with these key components on a long term basis or at all 
in addition to the above  we have several sole suppliers for key components of our products currently under development 
tribune is the sole supplier of the program guide data for the tivo service 
tribune media services  inc is the current sole supplier of program guide data for the tivo service 
our current television listings data agreement with tribune became effective on march  and has an initial term of three years and will automatically renew for up to two additional terms of one year each unless we notify tribune of our desire to terminate the agreement at least days before the end of the then current term 
if tribune breaches its obligation to provide us with data  or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under our agreement  we would be unable to provide certain aspects of the tivo service to our customers 
this would have serious repercussions on our brand and our ability to succeed in the market 
we may be unable to secure an alternate source of guide data on acceptable terms 
if our arrangements or our consumer electronics manufacturers arrangements with broadcom  amtek  atmel or tribune media services were to terminate or expire  or if we or our manufacturers were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these 
table of contents 
index to financial statements components or required program guide data from our suppliers  our search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays  added expense or disruption in product or service availability 
we are dependent on our major retail partners for distribution of our products to consumers 
we currently rely on our relationships with major retail distributors including best buy  circuit city  target  and others for distribution of tivo enabled dvrs 
we do not typically enter into long term volume commitments with our major retail distributors 
one of our retail customers accounted for of our net revenues in the fiscal year ended january  if one or several of our major retail partners were to discontinue selling our products  the volume of tivo enabled dvrs sold to consumers could decrease which could in turn harm our business 
intellectual property claims against us could be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
from time to time  we receive letters from third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property 
regardless of their merit  we are forced to devote time and resources to respond to these letters 
in addition  if any of these third parties or others were to sue us  our business could be harmed because intellectual property litigation may be time consuming and expensive  divert management s attention and resources away from our business  cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction  cause the cancellation of new products or services  or require us to pay significant royalties and or licensing fees 
the emerging enhanced television industry is highly litigious  particularly in the area of on screen program guides 
additionally  many patents covering interactive television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized 
for example  we are aware of multiple patents for pausing live television 
a number of companies in the enhanced television industry earn substantial profits from technology licensing  and the introduction of new technologies such as ours is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies 
a successful claim of infringement against us  our inability to obtain an acceptable license from the holder of the patent or other right  or our inability to design around an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturers to cease manufacturing dvrs that enable the tivo service  our retailers to stop selling the product or us to cease providing our service  or all of the above  which would eliminate our ability to generate revenues 
under our agreements with many of our manufacturing and licensing partners  we are obligated to indemnify them in the event that our technology infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
due to these indemnity obligations  we could be forced to incur material expenses if our manufacturing and licensing partners are sued 
if they were to lose the lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
in addition  because the products sold by our manufacturing and licensing partners often involve the use of other persons technology  this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the product in question  even if the claim does not pertain to our technology 
pending intellectual property litigations 
on september   pause technology llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts alleging willful and deliberate infringement of us reissue patent no

the complaint seeks injunctive relief  compensatory and treble damages and command audio s costs and expenses  including reasonable attorneys fees 
on june   the court denied sony s motion for summary judgment of invalidity and granted in part and denied in part command audio s motion for summary judgment of infringement 
the court found that certain sony products  including sony s accused products that enable the tivo service  literally infringed certain claims of the patent but did not rule on the validity or unenforceability of the patents

index to financial statements sony s allegations that the patents in suit are unenforceable was conducted in october on january   the court issued a findings of fact and conclusions of law ruling that the patents in suit are not unenforceable based on the allegations presented in the october trial 
trial of the remaining issues  including infringement of certain asserted patent claims  validity of all the asserted patent claims and sony s remaining allegations regarding the enforceability of the patents  is scheduled to commence in october under the terms of our agreement with sony governing the distribution of certain dvrs that enable the tivo service  we are required to indemnify sony against any and all claims  damages  liabilities  costs  and expenses relating to claims that our technology infringes upon intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we believe sony has meritorious defenses against this lawsuit  however  due to our indemnification obligations  we are incurring material expenses in connection with this litigation 
since february  we have incurred million in legal expenses 
the outcome of this matter or range of potential losses is currently not determinable 
if sony were to lose this lawsuit  our business could be harmed

 each relating to an integrated car dubbing system 
the complaints were consolidated into one action captioned igbinadolor v 
sony corporation et al 
the complaints allege that mr 
igbinadolor is the owner of the patents and trademark allegedly infringed 
on november   we filed our answer  affirmative defenses and counterclaims and on january   we filed a motion for summary judgment 
we are incurring expenses in connection with this litigation that may become material in the future  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we are aware that some media companies may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the digital video recorder industry 
these organizations or individual media companies may attempt to require companies in the digital video recorder industry to obtain copyright or other licenses 
lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services  delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services  restrict our use of some television content  increase our costs  and adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on our relationship with directv for subscription growth 
our relationship with directv could be affected in the future by news corp 
s acquisition of the directv group 
on december   news corp 
acquired general motor s economic interest in hughes  subsequently renamed the directv group 
simultaneously  news corp 
acquired an additional of the directv group for a total of of its outstanding stock 
it is possible that directv under news corp 
could seek to transition to an alternative dvr technology platform  such as that created by nds  which is majority owned by news corp 
it is also possible news corp 
may slow the pace of dvr deployment by directv in an effort to protect its content businesses from perceived threats posed by dvrs 
directv has recently announced that its core initiatives and new customer acquisition will focus on its new dvr from nds 
if our current development agreement with directv expires without being renewed  amended  or replaced  our business could be harmed 
a significant number of our new and existing tivo service subscriptions are directv customers with tivo service 
our current development agreement with directv does not expire until february neither tivo nor directv will have any further obligations to each other if our current development agreement with directv expires without being renewed  amended  or replaced 
while directv would have the right to continue to service existing directv receivers with tivo service without payment to us  it would not have the right to add new directv customers with tivo service 
and while tivo would no longer be able to generate additional revenue from the then current directv customers with tivo service  we would have no further 
table of contents 
index to financial statements obligation to provide upgrades  fixes  new features  or software support 
directv  however  also has the option under our current development agreement to buy a royalty bearing software and technology license from us 
this license would grant directv access to our source code and technology to make  modify with certain exceptions  sell  and distribute directv receivers with tivo service to add new subscribers after the expiration of our current agreement 
our limited operating history may make it difficult for us or investors to evaluate trends and other factors that affect our business 
we were incorporated in august  and we have been providing subscription services only since march  prior to that time  our operations consisted primarily of research and development efforts 
to date  only a limited number of dvrs have been sold  and we have obtained only a limited number of subscriptions to the tivo service 
as a result of our limited operating history  our historical financial and operating information is of limited value in evaluating our future operating results 
it may be difficult to predict accurately our future revenues  costs of revenues  expenses  or results of operations 
in addition  any evaluation of our business must be made in light of the risks and difficulties encountered by companies offering products or services in new and rapidly evolving markets 
dvr services are a relatively new product category for consumers  and it may be difficult to predict the future growth rate  if any  or size of the market for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us 
as a result  we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts and adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
such inability could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
we face a number of challenges in the sale and marketing of the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
our success depends upon the successful retail marketing of the tivo service and related dvrs  which began in the third quarter of calendar year many consumers are not aware of the benefits of our products 
dvr products and services represent a relatively new consumer electronics category 
retailers  consumers  and potential partners may perceive little or no benefit from digital video recorder products and services 
we have only been providing the tivo service since many consumers are not aware of its benefits  and therefore may not value the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
we will need to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to educate consumers and promote our products in order to increase our subscriptions 
we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo service 
consumers may not be willing to pay for our products and services 
many of our customers already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television 
we must convince these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo service 
consumers may perceive the tivo service and related dvr as too expensive 
in order to continue to grow our subscription base  we will need to continue to reduce our costs and lower the price of our dvr 
the availability of competing services that do not require subscription fees or that are enabled by low or no cost dvrs will harm our ability to effectively attract and retain subscriptions 
in addition  dvrs that enable the tivo service can be used to pause  rewind  and fast forward through live shows without an active subscription to the tivo service 
if a significant number of purchasers of the tivo enabled dvrs use these devices without subscribing to the tivo service or cancel their existing subscriptions  our revenue growth will decline and we may not achieve profitability 
growth in our tivo owned subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by competitive offerings by directv and comcast who also would be able to offer the tivo service 
our ability to grow our tivo owned subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by competition from our licensing partners  such as directv and comcast  who may be able to offer tivo branded dvr solutions to their customers at more attractive pricing then we may be able to offer the tivo service to our tivo owned customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to differentiate the tivo service from the tivo branded dvr solutions offered by our licensing partners  customers who would have otherwise chosen the tivo service may instead choose to purchase the tivo branded dvr solution from our licensing partners 
additionally  to the extent that potential customers defer subscribing to the tivo service in order to wait for future announced  but not deployed  tivo branded dvr solutions from our licensing partners  such as comcast  the growth of our tivo owned subscriptions could be reduced 
if the growth in our tivo owned subscriptions is reduced  our business could be harmed 
we compete with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services for consumer spending 
dvrs and the tivo service compete in markets that are crowded with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services 
the competition for consumer spending is intense  and many consumers on limited budgets may choose other products and services over 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ours 
dvrs compete for consumer spending with products such as dvd players  satellite television systems  personal computers  and video game consoles 
the tivo service competes with home entertainment services such as cable and satellite television  movie rentals  pay per view  and video on demand 
see we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues  increase our subscription acquisition costs  and hinder our ability to generate new subscriptions 
many of these products or services have established markets  broad user bases  and proven consumer acceptance 
in addition  many of the manufacturers and distributors of these competing devices and services have substantially greater brand recognition  market presence  distribution channels  advertising and marketing budgets and promotional  and other strategic partners 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to effectively differentiate the dvr or the tivo service from other consumer electronics devices or entertainment services 
we compete with digital cable and satellite dvrs 
cable and satellite service providers are accelerating deployment of integrated cable and satellite receivers with dvrs that bundle basic dvr services with other digital services and do not require their customers to purchase hardware 
if we are not able to enter into agreements with these service providers to embed the tivo service into their offerings  our ability to attract their subscribers to the tivo service would be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
it is expensive to establish a strong brand 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing key strategic relationships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the digital video recorder market with competing products and services 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in subscriptions or revenues to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract subscriptions and effectively compete in the digital video recorder market 
we rely on our customers and consumer electronics manufacturers to market and distribute our products and services 
in addition to our own efforts  our customers and consumer electronics manufacturers distribute dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we rely on their sales forces  marketing budgets and brand images to promote and support dvrs and the tivo service 
we expect to continue to rely on our relationships with these companies to promote and support dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the loss of one or more of these companies could require us to undertake more of these activities on our own 
as a result  we would spend significant resources to support dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
we also expect to rely on directv and other partners to provide marketing support for the tivo service 
the failure of one or more of these companies to provide anticipated marketing support will require us to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service 
if we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for dvrs and the tivo service  our ability to attract subscriptions to the tivo service will be limited 
if we are unable to create or maintain multiple revenue streams  we may not be able to cover our expenses and this could cause our revenues to suffer 
our long term success depends on our ability to generate revenues from multiple revenue streams 
although our initial success depends on building a significant customer base and generating subscription fees from the tivo service  our long term success will depend on securing additional revenue streams such as licensing  advertising  audience measurement research  revenues from programmers  and electronic commerce 
in order to derive substantial revenues from these activities  we will need to attract and retain a large and growing base of subscriptions to the tivo service 
we also will need to work closely with television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these areas 
we may not be able to work effectively with these parties to develop products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs 
we also may be unable to work with or to continuing working with these parties to distribute video and collect and distribute data or other information to provide these product or services 
in addition  we are currently obligated to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners 
any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscriptions or ability to attract new strategic partners or maintain and extend our relationships with our current strategic partners could seriously harm our ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we face risks in connection with our licensing and marketing agreement with comcast for the development of a tivo branded dvr software solution and advertising management system for deployment to comcast customers 
we may never develop the purchased tivo branded dvr software solution and or advertising management system 
pursuant to our agreement with comcast  development and deployment of the tivo service software solution and advertising management system is targeted to occur within two years from the date of the agreement  with certain consequences  including  but not limited to  termination of the agreement in the event development of the tivo service software solution has not been completed by such date 
our ability to develop and enable deployment by comcast of the tivo service software solution and advertising management system within two years could be delayed or prevented by technological problems or a lack of available resources to meet our obligations under the agreement 
in the event we failed to deliver either the tivo service software solution and or advertising management system to comcast within two years  our agreement with comcast could be terminated and our business could be harmed 
we may not be successful in our agreement with comcast 
our ability to benefit from our agreement with comcast is dependent upon the mass deployment and adoption of the tivo service software solution by comcast customers 
additionally  our ability to benefit from our agreement with comcast is dependent upon our ability to successfully sell advertising to third parties 
furthermore  comcast has the right to receive certain most favored terms from us such that if we were to license similar products and services to other parties at more attractive terms than what comcast receives  then comcast would be entitled to receive the new more favorable terms 
additionally  comcast has the right to terminate its agreement with us in the event we are subject to certain specified change of control transactions involving specified companies 
in the event any of these events occurred  we would have difficulty generating revenues under the agreement and our business could be harmed 
if we are unable to introduce new products or services  or if our new products and services are unsuccessful  the growth in our subscription base and revenues may suffer 
to attract and retain subscriptions and generate revenues  we must continue to maintain and add to our functionality and content and introduce products and services which embody new technologies and  in some instances  new industry standards 
this challenge will require hardware and software improvements  as well as maintaining and adding new collaborations with programmers  advertisers  network operators  hardware manufacturers  and other strategic partners 
these activities require significant time and resources and may require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established companies in the television industry 
these companies include television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers 
in each of these examples  a small number of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant to work with us to develop new products and services for digital video recorders as well as maintain our current functionality 
if we are unable to maintain and further develop and improve the tivo service or maintain and expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner  our ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue will suffer 
we face risks in the development of an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content 
we previously announced on september  a joint development agreement with netflix  inc involving the development of a joint entertainment offering for the distribution of digital content 
our joint development agreement with netflix involves no long term commitments nor significant economic benefits for either company 
in the future  we may be unable to develop a joint entertainment offering with netflix or may develop an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content separately or with other third parties 
we face competitive  technological  and financial risks in the development of an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content 
if we are unable to develop a competitive entertainment offering in the future with netflix  on our own  or with a third party  our business could be adversely affected 
our ability to retain our current customers may decrease in the future which could increase our tivo owned subscription monthly churn rate and could cause our revenues to suffer 
we believe factors such as increased competition in the dvr marketplace  increased price sensitivity in the consumer base  any deterioration in the quality of our service  or product lifetime subscriptions no longer using our service may cause our tivo owned subscription monthly churn rate to increase 
if we are unable to retain our subscriptions by limiting the factors that we believe increase subscription churn  our ability to grow our subscription base could suffer and our revenues could be harmed 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we fail to manage our growth  it could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues 
the growth in our subscription base has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
specific risks we face as our business expands include any inability of our systems to accommodate our expected subscription growth may cause service interruptions or delay our introduction of new services 
we internally developed many of the systems we use to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions 
the ability of these systems to scale as we rapidly add new subscriptions is unproven 
we must continually improve these systems to accommodate subscription growth and add features and functionality to the tivo service 
our inability to add software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  systems or network infrastructure could adversely affect our business  cause service interruptions or delay the introduction of new services 
we will need to provide acceptable customer support  and any inability to do so would harm our brand and ability to generate and retain new subscriptions 
our ability to increase sales  retain current and future subscriptions and strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
some customers require significant support when installing the dvr and becoming acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products and services to a diverse customer base  and we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers require 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our customer support functions 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service and dvr will damage our reputation in the digital video recorder and consumer electronics marketplace and strain our relationships with customers and consumer electronics manufacturers 
this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscriptions and could cause harm to our reputation and brand 
we will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth  and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting 
to manage the expected growth of our operations  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations and expected growth 
for example  we replaced our accounting and billing system at the beginning of august delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and cause harm to our reputation and brand 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting 
we must manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
the introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task  involving significant expenditures in research and development  training  promotion and sales channel development  and management of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving inventory 
as new products are introduced  we intend to monitor closely the inventory of products to be replaced  and to phase out their manufacture in a controlled manner 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute product transitions in this manner or that product transitions will be executed without harming our operating results 
failure to develop products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our competitive position 
the lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently offer commit us to providing services for an indefinite period 
the revenue we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs 
we currently offer product lifetime subscriptions that commit us to provide service for as long as the dvr is in service 
we receive the product lifetime subscription fee for the tivo service in advance and amortize it as subscription revenue over four years  which is our estimate of the service life of the dvr 
if these product lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than anticipated  we will incur costs such as telecommunications and customer support costs without a corresponding revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing costs of service from other sources 
as of january   we had  product lifetime subscriptions  or approximately of our total installed subscription base  that had exceeded the four year period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues 
if the useful life of the recorder were shorter or longer than four years  we would recognize revenues earlier or later 
our product is still relatively new  and as we gather more user information  we might revise this estimated life 
we share a substantial portion of the revenue we generate from subscription fees with some of our retail customers and consumer electronics companies 
we may be unable to generate enough revenue to cover these obligations 
in some of our agreements  we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our retail customers and consumer electronics manufacturing companies in exchange for manufacturing  distribution and marketing support  and discounts on key components for dvrs 
these agreements require us to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscription with multiple companies 
these agreements also require us to share a portion of our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements subscription fees whether or not we increase or decrease the price of the tivo service 
if we change our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that these relationships will help us obtain subscriptions  broaden market acceptance of digital video recorders  and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
tiered pricing for the tivo service may reduce our average revenue per user 
we may elect to offer additional tiers of the tivo service at various price points  which may have the effect of reducing our average revenue per user 
the nature of some of our relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future 
from time to time  we have engaged and may engage in the future in discussions with other parties concerning relationships  which have and may include equity investments by such parties in our company 
while we believe that such relationships have enhanced our ability to finance and develop our business model  the terms and conditions of such relationships may place some restrictions on the operation of our business in the future 
entertainment companies may claim that some of the features of our dvrs violate copyright laws  which could force us to incur significant costs in defending such actions and affect our ability to market the tivo service and the products that enable the tivo service 
although we have not been the subject of such actions to date  one of our former competitor s digital video recorders was the subject of several copyright infringement lawsuits by a number of major entertainment companies  including the three major television networks 
these lawsuits alleged that the competitor s digital video recorders violate copyright laws by allowing users to skip commercials  delete recordings only when instructed and use the internet to send recorded materials to other users 
tivo enabled dvrs have some similar features  including the ability to fast forward through commercials  the ability to delete recordings only when instructed  and when the tivotogo service is released  the ability to transfer recordings from a tivo enabled dvr to a pc 
based on market or consumer pressures  we may decide in the future to add additional features similar to those of our former competitors or that may otherwise be objectionable to entertainment companies 
if similar actions are filed against us based on current or future features of our dvrs  entertainment companies may seek injunctions to prevent us from including these features and or damages 
such litigation can be costly and may divert the efforts of our management 
furthermore  if we were ordered to remove features from our dvrs  we may experience increased difficulty in marketing the tivo service and related tivo enabled dvrs and may suffer reduced revenues as a result 
our success depends on our ability to secure and protect our patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have filed patent applications and provisional patent applications covering substantially all of the technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality 
to date  several of these patents have been granted  but we cannot assure you that any additional patents will ever be granted  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us 
our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against echostar communications corporation and may incur significant expenses as a result  and an adverse outcome could harm our business 
on january   we filed a complaint against echostar communications corporation in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging willful and deliberate infringement of us patent no 
 entitled multimedia time warping system 
on january   we amended our complaint to add echostar dbs corporation  echostar technologies corporation  and echosphere limited liability corporation as additional defendants 
we allege that we are the owner of this patent and further allege that the defendants have willfully and deliberately infringed this patent by making  selling  offering to sell and or selling digital video recording devices  digital video recording device software  and or personal television services in the united states 
on march   the court denied motions to dismiss and transfer our patent infringement case against echostar communications corporation and its affiliates 
the court scheduled jury selection to begin october  in marshall  texas 
we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements seek unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction against the defendants further infringement of the patent 
we could incur material expenses in this litigation 
we could be prevented from selling or developing our tivo software if the gnu general public license governing the linux operating system and linux kernel and similar licenses under which our product is developed and licensed is not enforceable 
the linux kernel and the linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar open source licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified  and distributed 
the gnu general public license is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
sco group  inc  or sco  has publicly alleged that certain linux kernels contain unauthorized unix code or derivative works 
uncertainty concerning sco s allegations  regardless of their merit  could adversely affect our manufacturing and other customer and supplier relationships 
it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in our tivo software that runs on a linux based operating system 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our tivo software and would adversely affect our business 
if there is an adverse outcome in the class action litigation that has been filed against us  our business may be harmed 
we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
this action  which is captioned wercberger v 
tivo et al  also names several of the underwriters involved in our initial public offering as defendants 
this class action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock from september   the time of our initial public offering  through december  the central allegation in this action is that our ipo underwriters solicited and received undisclosed commissions from  and entered into undisclosed arrangements with  certain investors who purchased our common stock in our ipo and in the after market 
the complaint also alleges that the tivo defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in our ipo prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these alleged arrangements 
more than issuers have been named in similar lawsuits 
in july  an omnibus motion to dismiss all complaints against issuers and individual defendants affiliated with issuers including the tivo defendants was filed by the entire group of issuer defendants in these similar actions 
on october   our officers were dismissed as defendants in the lawsuit 
on february   the court in this action issued its decision on defendants omnibus motion to dismiss 
this decision dismissed the section b claim as to tivo but denied the motion to dismiss the section claim as to tivo and virtually all of the other issuer defendants 
on june   the plaintiffs announced a proposed settlement with the company and the other issuer defendants 
the proposed settlement provides that the plaintiffs will be guaranteed billion dollars in recoveries by the insurers of the company and other issuer defendants 
accordingly  any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by the company s insurers in accordance with the proposed settlement 
in addition  the company and the other settling issuer defendants will assign to the plaintiffs certain claims that they may have against the underwriters 
if recoveries in excess of billion dollars are obtained by the plaintiffs from the underwriters  the company s and the other issuers defendants monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied 
furthermore  the settlement is subject to a hearing on fairness and approval by the federal district court overseeing the ipo litigation 
on february   the court issued an order preliminarily approving the terms of the proposed settlement 
the court also certified the settlement classes and class representatives for purposes of the settlement only 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and assignment of claims against the underwriters  and because the settlement has not yet been finally approved by the federal district court  the ultimate outcome of the matter cannot presently be predicted 
in the event that the court does not approve the final settlement  we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this action vigorously  however  we could be forced to incur material expenses in the litigation  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
legislation  laws or regulations that govern the television industry  the delivery of programming and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions could expose us to legal action if we fail to comply or could require us to change our business 
the delivery of television programming and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions via the tivo service and a dvr represent a relatively new category in the television and home entertainment industries 
as such  it is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business 
changes in the regulatory climate  the enactment of new legislation  or the expansion  enforcement or interpretation of existing laws could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could require changes to our business 
for example  legislation regarding customer privacy or copyright could be enacted or expanded to apply to the tivo service  which could adversely affect our business 
new or existing copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of television programming  which would adversely affect our business 
it is unknown whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the digital 
table of contents 
index to financial statements video recorder market 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business 
we may have significant expenses associated with staying appraised of local  state  federal  and international legislation and regulation of our business and in presenting tivo s positions on proposed laws and regulations 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications and cable industries 
the majority of fcc regulations  while not directly affecting us  do affect many of the companies on whom we substantially rely for the marketing and distribution of the dvr and the tivo service 
as such  the indirect effect of these regulations may adversely affect our business 
in addition  the fcc could promulgate new regulations  or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter the features or functionality of the tivo service 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs and may affect our ability to be in compliance with such new corporate governance provisions in the future 
the existing federal securities laws and regulations impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of in july  a significant number of new corporate governance requirements have been adopted or proposed 
these new requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
while management continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we can not assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
deficiencies  particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  a decline in our stock price  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  reputation  results of operation  financial condition or liquidity 
the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and continually changing 
recent actions and public comments from the securities exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
similarly  the us congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles 
the fasb has recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards or are developing new proposed standards  such as accounting for stock options  which would represent a significant change from current industry practices 
in addition  many companies accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public 
while we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward 
in addition  were we to change our critical accounting estimates  including with respect to the recognition of revenue from our product lifetime subscriptions  our results of operations could be significantly impacted 
we need to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscriptions confidential data  and any inability to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action 
the dvr collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our customers consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that we use to protect this data could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems we use to protect our subscriptions confidential information 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
uncertainty in the marketplace regarding the use of data from subscriptions could reduce demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses 
consumers may be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the dvr 
currently  we gather anonymous information about our customers viewing choices while using the tivo service  unless a customer affirmatively consents to the collection of personally identifiable viewing information 
this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual customer 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for digital video recording and for our products and services 
changes in our privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our reputation and business 
we have limited experience in overseeing manufacturing processes and managing inventory and failure to do so effectively may result in supply imbalances or product recalls 
we have contracted for the manufacture of certain tivo enabled dvrs with a contract manufacturer 
we sell these units to retailers and distributors  as well as through our own online sales efforts 
as part of this effort  we expect to maintain some finished goods inventory of the units throughout the year 
overseeing manufacturing processes and managing inventory are outside of our core business and our experience in these areas is limited 
if we fail to effectively oversee the manufacturing process and manage inventory  we may suffer from insufficient inventory to meet consumer demand or excess inventory 
ineffective oversight of the manufacturing process could also result in product recalls 
product defects  system failures or interruptions to the tivo service may have a negative impact on our revenues  damage our reputation and decrease our ability to attract new customers 
our ability to provide uninterrupted service and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
our computer hardware and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and profits 
we currently house the server hardware that delivers the tivo service at only one location and continue to explore the benefits of establishing a backup facility 
our business also will be harmed if consumers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  service outages will create a flood of customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and brand and possibly trigger requests for refunds on subscriptions fees and hardware purchases and possible consumer litigation 
we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects 
these problems can affect system uptime and result in significant warranty and repair problems  which could cause customer service and customer relations problems 
correcting errors in our software or fixing defects in our products requires significant time and resources  which could delay product releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service 
any delivery by us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the dvrs and the tivo service 
in addition  defective products could cause a risk of injury that may subject us to litigation or cause us to have to undertake a product recall 
for example  we have become aware of occasions where a part has come loose from the remote control device that comes with the dvrs that enable the tivo service  including occurrences where a young child has gagged on or ingested a part of the remote control device 
while we are unaware of any injuries resulting from the use of our products  if we are required to repair or replace any of our products  we could incur significant costs  which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have begun the search process for a new chief executive officer 
if we are unable to hire an acceptable candidate or if the search process takes too long  the operation of our business could suffer 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to identify and attract a new chief executive officer 
if we are unable to attract and hire an acceptable chief executive officer candidate in a timely manner  our business could suffer from the uncertainty caused by the continued management search process 
our current chief executive officer has agreed to stay on as ceo until a replacement candidate has been identified and hired  although he is not obligated to do so 
he has also agreed to continue to serve as chairman of the board of directors after stepping down as ceo 
if our current ceo were to step down prior to our hiring of a replacement or were he not to continue as chairman of the board  our business could also be harmed 
if we lose key management personnel  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of any members of our executive management team and our inability to hire additional executive management could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we do not have key man insurance policies for any of our key personnel which may adversely affect our ability to attract new executives

we may become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents and our rights agreement could be impediments to such a takeover 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing 
in addition  special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of the total number of authorized directors  the chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or the holders of or more of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board of directors created either by resignation  death  disqualification  removal or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors in office  although less than a quorum

subject to limited exceptions  the rights will become exercisable following the tenth day after a person or group announces the acquisition of or more or or more in the case of america online  inc and its affiliates and associates until such time as america online and its affiliates and associates cease to beneficially own any common shares of our common stock  and thereby becomes an acquiring person  or announces commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the ownership by the person or group of or more or or more in the case of america online and its affiliates and associates until such time as america online and its affiliates and associates cease to beneficially own any common shares of our common stock 
the rights are not exercisable as of april  we will be entitled to redeem the rights at per right at any time prior to the time that a person or group becomes an acquiring person 
these provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and our rights agreement could make it more difficult for us to be acquired by another company  even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our stockholders 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the future  our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include demand for tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service  the timing and introduction of new services and features on the tivo service  seasonality and other consumer and advertising trends  changes in revenue sharing arrangements with our strategic relationships  entering into new or terminating existing strategic partnerships  changes in the subsidy payments we make to certain strategic relationships  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer electronics market  timing of revenue recognition under our licensing agreements

index to financial statements loss of subscriptions to the tivo service  and general economic conditions 
because our expenses precede associated revenues  unanticipated shortfalls in revenues could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
consumer electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year 
although predicting consumer demand for our products is very difficult  we have experienced that sales of dvrs and new subscriptions to the tivo service have been disproportionately high during the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products  our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come from targeted commercials and other forms of television advertising enabled by the tivo service 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal and cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers  which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly in any given period 
if we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through the next twelve months 
however  as we continue to grow our business  we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will decline  stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
the large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price for our stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
several of our stockholders own a substantial number of our shares 
in august  we issued five year warrants to convertible noteholders and bankers to purchase a total of  shares  shares of tivo common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire in as of january   options to purchase a total of  shares were outstanding under our option and equity incentive plans  and there were  shares available for future grants 
we have filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our option and equity incentive plans 
future sales of the shares of the common stock  or the registration for sale of such common stock  or the issuance of common stock to satisfy our current or future cash payment obligations or to acquire technology  property  or other businesses  could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale or issuance of such stock  as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans  as well as the shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of our outstanding convertible notes and warrants  also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities

index to financial statements we expect to continue to experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
since our initial public offering in september through april   our common stock has closed between per share and per share  closing at on april  the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to  among other things  the factors discussed in this section and the following factors changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  our failure to meet  or our ability to exceed  the expectations of securities analysts or investors  release of new or enhanced products or introduction of new marketing initiatives by us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of the creation  developments under or termination of significant strategic relationships  joint ventures  significant contracts or acquisitions  fluctuations in the market prices generally for technology and media related stocks  fluctuations in general economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  market conditions affecting the television and home entertainment industry and the technology sector  fluctuations in operating results  and additions or departures of key personnel 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging companies  and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock
