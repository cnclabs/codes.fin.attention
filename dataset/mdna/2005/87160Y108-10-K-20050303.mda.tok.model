overview we operate in one segment  the development and licensing of software products that are used in the design and verification of semiconductors 
we market and sell our products throughout north america  principally the united states  as well as in europe  japan and other parts of asia 
our revenue from sales outside north america represented  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
our products include our synplify product  an fpga logic synthesis product  our synplify pro product  an advanced fpga logic synthesis product  our hdl analyst product  a complementary product to synplify which provides graphical representation and design analysis  our certify product  a product for verification of asics by synthesizing multi fpga prototypes  
table of contents our amplify physical optimizer product  a physical synthesis product for fpgas  our synplify asic product  a timing driven asic synthesis product optimized to improve productivity  our fortify family of power grid design solutions  our identify product  a product that assists in debugging hardware directly in the rtl source code  our amplify rapidchip physical optimizer product  a customized physical synthesis product for lsi logic s platform asic  our amplify issp physical optimizer product  a customized physical synthesis product for nec electronics structured asic  and our synplify dsp product  a solution for implementing dsp designs in fpgas the majority of our sales are perpetual licenses to use our software products and related maintenance services  and therefore our revenue consists of license and maintenance revenue 
maintenance services include unspecified product updates when and if available  electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support 
historically  we have generated the majority of our total revenue from licenses 
however  as a result of our growing installed customer base  maintenance revenue has increased as a percent of total revenue 
we also sell time based licenses to use our software products  which have represented a growing proportion of total revenue 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their respective terms 
additionally  from time to time we provide custom software development services to our customers  revenue from which is recorded in license revenue 
highlights worldwide economic conditions improved in we experienced strengthening in our fpga and asic synthesis businesses  including the emerging structured asic segment of our asic synthesis business 
maintenance revenue grew as our customer base increased and maintenance renewal rates increased 
while we maintained our cost control measures  we also incurred significant expenses for higher compensation due to additional employees and removal of salary reductions  as well as increased commission expense from the sales force exceeding quota targets 
additionally  we incurred higher expenses for compliance with corporate governance regulations 
financial highlights for the year are as follows total revenue for was million  a increase from million for license revenue for was million  a increase from million for time based license revenue as a percentage of our license revenue for the year was  an increase from for maintenance revenue for was million  a increase from million for net income for was million  up from a  net loss for diluted net income per share for was compared to a loss for working capital for grew to million from million for critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition for each sale of a perpetual license  the first year of maintenance is generally sold with the license 
we defer the recognition of license and maintenance revenue until a purchase order is received from the customer  delivery of the product and perpetual license key has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  and we have no remaining obligations other than maintenance once all of the above conditions have been met  license revenue is recognized based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered in accordance with aicpa statement of position  modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance period since customers under maintenance agreements receive unspecified product updates  electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support throughout their maintenance period  which is typically one year 
the majority of our customers also purchase maintenance renewals annually on a stand alone basis at either or of the perpetual license list price  depending on the product  which establishes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of maintenance 
we also offer two year and three year term licenses for certain products under which the customer purchases the first year of maintenance with the license and can renew maintenance in each of the following one or two years 
revenue from term licenses is recognized in the same manner as revenue from perpetual licenses as vsoe of the fair value of maintenance is established by the maintenance renewal pricing at either or of the perpetual license list price  depending on the product 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable for sales with non standard payment terms by evaluating our history of collections from these customers 
in no case will we deem a fee to be fixed or determinable where the fee is due after the expiration of the license or more than months after delivery 
we make judgments as to whether collection of the fee is probable based on the analysis provided by our credit review procedures 
revenue on arrangements to end user customers that have met all of the revenue recognition criteria except probability of collection is recognized as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally as payments are received 
revenue on sales to distributors is considered to have met the probability of collection criterion when the distributor has resold the product to an end user and either we have received payment for the product or we assess that we have a substantial and sustained history of collections from the distributor 
we also sell time based licenses to use our software products for specified periods of time 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their respective terms 
revenue from time based licenses is allocated between license and maintenance revenue in similar proportion to perpetual license transactions  and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the license as we do not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance for time based licenses since it is not priced or offered separately 
in addition  we have provided a version of one of our products to certain fpga manufacturers for distribution to their customers 
as part of this arrangement we have certain maintenance and support obligations to the fpga manufacturers 
revenue on this arrangement is also allocated to license and maintenance revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of each arrangement  as we do not have vsoe of fair value of maintenance for these arrangements since it is not priced or offered separately 

table of contents furthermore  we may sell time based licenses combined in an order with perpetual or term licenses 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue from the entire transaction straight line over the term of the longest time based license in the transaction  as generally we do not have vsoe on time based licenses 
we have entered into agreements with semiconductor manufacturers lsi logic  nec electronics and fujitsu microelectronics to customize our asic synthesis or physical synthesis tools for certain of their products 
when time based licenses are being purchased as part of the agreement  once the contract has been signed  delivery of the customized product has occurred  collection of the fee is probable and we have no remaining obligations other than maintenance  we recognize revenue from both the development and license fees on a straight line basis over the period of the licenses since we do not have vsoe of fair value of the time based licenses 
when licenses are not being purchased as part of the agreement  once the contract has been signed  we recognize revenue from the development fees on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue recognized from these arrangements represents less than of total revenue and is recorded in license revenue 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment using a fair value approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter as well as whenever indicators of impairment exist 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  including intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a long lived asset other than goodwill is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results and cash flows and  should different conditions prevail or judgments be made  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
our intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of five years 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and update quarterly an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the balance in the allowance account is comprised of a specific reserve for any particular receivable when collectibility is not probable and a provision for non specific accounts based on a specified range of percentages derived from historical experience applied to the outstanding balance in each aged group 
if after pursuing collection efforts on a specifically reserved receivable  payment is not expected  the receivable is deemed uncollectible and is written off 
such losses have not been material in any year  however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the table in schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves of this annual report provides a roll forward of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and such evaluations are based on available evidence of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our evaluation for the year ending december  was based on the cumulative pre tax losses we have sustained in the three years ended december

the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
years ended december  and total revenue our total revenue increased by to million for from million for license revenue 
license revenue increased by to million for from million for this increase was due to higher international license revenue as well as higher revenue from our asic products  including the recognition of revenue received from our agreements with nec electronics and lsi logic to customize our asic synthesis products

in  and  net cash provided by financing activities was from the sale of common stock as employees exercised stock options and purchased shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by repurchases of our stock 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount  type and timing of product license sales  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the extent to which customers continue to renew annual maintenance  the timing of customer payments on outstanding receivables  the cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these efforts  the cost and timing of sales and marketing activities  any acquisitions of products or technologies  any stock repurchases if a stock repurchase program is authorized  and the availability of financing 
we believe that our cash and short term investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may require additional financing within this period 
we intend to continue to invest in the 
table of contents development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
in addition  even if we have sufficient funds to meet our anticipated cash needs in the next months  we may need or choose to raise additional funds beyond this time 
we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  our failure could have a negative impact on our profitability and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty

recent accounting pronouncement see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncement including the expected date of adoption and effect on results of operations and financial condition 
factors affecting future operating results our sales and operating results have in the past been  and may in the future be  negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions in the united states and other major countries in which we operate although revenue increased in our united states operations in  we have in the past experienced negative effects from economic downturns in the united states and other countries 
in particular  the slowing of the eda industry in periods of and over the last few years has negatively impacted our business 
as recently as the third quarter of  we have seen customers tightly control spending and reduce or delay purchase orders 
additionally  in an effort to reduce spending  some customers have been seeking time based agreements which cause us to recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the license  thus reducing near term revenue 
economic downturns and industry slowdowns could reemerge  and may extend to other geographic regions 
a worsening of economic conditions in the united states  or extension of such conditions to other geographic regions or industries would adversely affect our business 
changes to our international sales personnel and channels have affected and may in the future negatively affect sales for the majority of our international revenue  we depend on a relatively small number of sales professionals in each country in which we operate 
as a result  turnover of even a small number of employees in a specific 
table of contents country may have a significant impact on sales in that region and our company as a whole 
specifically  we experienced turnover in asian countries in that had an adverse affect on our bookings and revenues 
additionally  any modifications or terminations of distributor relationships may have a negative impact on sales 
we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining although we had net income of million in  we had a net loss of  in and have had significant net losses in the past  including a net loss of million in we expect to continue to incur significant levels of operating expenses 
if revenue does not increase or declines  we may not be able to control our costs in order to achieve profitability 
if we are not profitable  the market price of our common stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
our expenses may increase in the next months as we hire additional employees  increase compensation for existing employees  increase marketing efforts  and maintain compliance with future corporate governance regulations any failure to increase our new product bookings and revenue as we implement our product and distribution strategies would also harm our ability to achieve or maintain profitability and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
the structured asic market is new and our future growth and profitability are dependent on its development a new breed of asic devices called structured asics has emerged 
in we introduced the first custom architecture specific synthesis tool for nec electronics new structured asic device as well as our first physical synthesis product for lsi logic s new platform asic device 
in  we customized our physical synthesis product for nec electronics structured asic device  as well as entered into a new development project with nec electronics where we will help develop a new capability for our structured asic product 
in addition  we are currently working on a customized physical synthesis product for fujitsu microelectronics structured asic device 
we are investing significant resources in customizing our products for this new market 
failure of the structured asic market to develop  or our failure to penetrate that market  would have a material adverse affect on our revenue and operating results 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products for a substantial portion of our license revenue  and a decline in sales of these products could cause our license revenue to decline historically  we have derived a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products 
license revenue for our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products accounted for  and of our total license revenue in  and  respectively 
we expect that revenue from these products will continue to account for a majority of our license revenue for at least the next months 
license revenue of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products in dollars decreased each year from through and may continue to decrease 
any factors which continue to adversely affect the pricing of  or demand for  our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products could cause our license revenue to decline and our business to suffer 
factors that may affect sales of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products  some of which are beyond our control  include the following overall market conditions  including a worsening economic downturn in both domestic and foreign markets  
table of contents the performance  quality and total cost of our software products relative to other logic synthesis products for fpgas  including those offered at little or no cost by fpga manufacturers  the quality and performance of our sales teams in individual geographic locations  the growth  changing technological requirements and degree of competition in the programmable semiconductor market  particularly with respect to fpgas  and the maintenance and enhancement of our existing relationships with leading manufacturers of fpgas  which may provide us advance information or detailed data about those vendors fpgas and software 
our near term revenue could decline as a result of increases in sales of time based licenses we have seen an increase in the number and dollar amount of time based license agreements 
time based license revenue accounted for approximately and of our total license revenue in and  respectively 
this trend may continue since customers may prefer time based licenses over perpetual licenses for our newer  higher priced products and customers who previously purchased perpetual licenses may choose to convert to time based licenses 
time based license agreements generally have terms from one to three years and we recognize revenue from them on a straight line basis over the term of the licenses 
increases in time based licenses could affect our near term revenue growth due to the delayed timing of revenue recognition for such licenses 
if our average selling price of time based licenses decreases  or if customers do not renew such licenses  our revenue could also decline 
any decline in our revenue  or lack of significant growth in our revenue  could result in a decrease in our stock price because our revenue may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders and the investment community 
our revenue could decline substantially if our existing customers do not continue to purchase additional licenses or maintenance from us  or if existing agreements with fpga manufacturers are canceled we rely on sales of additional licenses to our existing customers  as well as annual maintenance renewals for our products 
additional license sales to our existing customers represented of our license sales in and  and of our license sales in if we fail to sell additional licenses for our products to our existing customers  we would experience a material decline in revenue 
even if we are successful in selling our products to new customers  the level of our revenue could be harmed if our existing customers do not continue to purchase a substantial number of additional licenses from us or fail to renew their maintenance 
our success in generating revenue from existing customers is dependent on maintaining our relationships with those customers as well as increased need for and usage of our products by those customers 
additionally  we experienced lower rates of maintenance renewal during and compared to prior years including  but not limited to  the effects of customers inability to renew maintenance on some or all of their licenses due to business conditions or budget restrictions 
we have seen an improvement in our maintenance renewal rates for compared to however  if we were to again experience declines in maintenance renewal rates  our maintenance revenue could stop growing or decrease 
we have agreements with certain fpga manufacturers to resell a version of our synplify product 
some of these agreements allow for cancellation with a notice period 
revenue recognized from these agreements generated of our revenue in and of our revenue in and if these agreements were canceled or not renewed  our revenue could decline 
we may not succeed in developing  marketing and selling new or enhanced commercially acceptable logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products  and our operating results may decline as a result we develop logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products that leverage our core capabilities 
we also develop new features for our existing products 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with semiconductor manufacturers to develop customized tools for certain of their structured asic products 
customizing products and developing new features for existing products that meet the needs of electronic product 
table of contents designers require significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to introduce customized products or enhanced versions of existing products that are commercially acceptable in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be negatively affected 
growing competition  technological changes and other market factors that negatively affect the demand for fpgas and asics could also adversely affect our revenue 
our future growth and profitability will depend in large part on our ability to gain market acceptance of our products outside of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products  especially our asic products including structured asics  as well as recently introduced products  such as our synplify dsp product 
we cannot be certain that our newer products  our entry into the asic logic synthesis product market or other new markets  or our acquired products  will be successful 
if customers do not widely adopt such products  our operating results could decline 
our quarterly operating results and stock price may fluctuate because our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and we expect our business to be affected by seasonality our ability to accurately forecast quarterly sales is limited  which makes it difficult to predict the quarterly revenue that we will recognize 
in addition  the time required to initiate and complete a sale for our fpga products is relatively short  and our ability to foresee and react to changes in customer demand for our products may be limited and therefore inaccurate 
most of our costs are for personnel and facilities  which are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in relation to our expectations  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly to avoid lower quarterly operating results 
consequently  our quarterly operating results could fluctuate  and the fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the past we have experienced fluctuations in the sale of licenses for our products due to seasonality 
for example  sales may decline during the summer months  particularly in european markets  and we have experienced and anticipate we will continue to experience relatively lower product bookings in our first quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers and the economic incentives for our sales force 
these factors may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
if we experience an increase in the length of our sales cycle  our quarterly operating results could become more unpredictable and our stock price may decline as a result we experience sales cycles  or the time between an initial customer contact and completion of a sale  of generally two weeks to several months for our fpga products  depending on the product 
when the recent economic downturn began  we experienced an increase in the length of our sales cycle which has since stabilized 
if we experience such an increase in the length of our sales cycle again  our quarterly operating results could suffer and our stock price could decline as a result 
the sales cycles for certain of our asic products  including certify and synplify asic are substantially longer than those of our fpga products  which could result in additional unpredictability of our quarterly revenue  especially if interest in our asic products increase 
in addition  the timing of product releases from competitors as well as releases of our own products can cause sales cycles to increase as customers evaluate the new products 
we depend on our marketing  product development and sales relationships with leading fpga manufacturers  and if these relationships suffer  we may have difficulty introducing and selling our fpga synthesis products and our revenue could decline we believe that our success in maintaining acceptance in the fpga market depends in part on our ability to maintain or further develop our strategic marketing  product development and sales relationships with leading fpga manufacturers  including altera and xilinx 
we believe our relationships with leading fpga manufacturers are important in validating our technology  facilitating broad market acceptance of our fpga synthesis products and enhancing our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
for example  we attempt to coordinate our product offerings with future releases of altera s and xilinx s fpga components and software 
if we are unable to maintain or enhance our existing relationships with altera and xilinx and develop a similar 
table of contents relationship with other major fpga vendors  we may have difficulty selling our fpga synthesis products or we may not be able to introduce products on a timely basis that capitalize on new fpga component characteristics or software feature enhancements 
we have been experiencing and may continue to experience increased competition as a result of fpga manufacturers competing in the design software market or investing in emerging software companies fpga manufacturers currently compete in the fpga design software market by licensing their own synthesis products at little or no cost and or by distributing our competitors products 
for example  both altera and xilinx sell synthesis products that are competitive with our synplify and synplify pro products and adversely impact the price or market for our fpga synthesis products or harm our business and financial prospects 
fpga manufacturers may also choose to assist  through financial  equity investment or other support  emerging eda software companies whose products could compete with or outperform ours 
an increase in the number of our competitors or the quality and availability of competing products could reduce the value of our products in the market place and adversely affect our business 
we rely on our marketing  sales and product and library support relationships with leading asic manufacturers  and if we fail to maintain or expand such relationships  we may have difficulty selling our asic products and our revenue could be negatively impacted we believe that our success in penetrating the asic market depends in part on our ability to develop strategic marketing  sales and product and library support relationships with leading asic manufacturers 
we believe relationships with leading asic manufacturers are important in validating our technology  facilitating market acceptance of our asic products and enhancing our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
relationships we have established to date include arm holdings plc which recently acquired artisan components  fujitsu microelectronics  ibm microelectronics  lsi logic  nec electronics  and virtual silicon technology inc these asic and asic library vendors have worked with us to develop and qualify our software into all or a portion of their asic design flows 
if we are unable to sustain these relationships or develop relationships with other key asic manufacturers or do not do so in a timely manner  we may have difficulty selling our asic products 
in addition  we may not be able to enhance our products in a timely manner to capitalize on new asic component characteristics or software feature enhancements  which could negatively impact our revenue growth 
as we enter into development agreements with semiconductor manufacturers for our structured asic products  our revenue could become more unpredictable we have entered  and expect to continue to enter  into development agreements with semiconductor manufacturers to customize our asic synthesis or physical synthesis tools for certain of their products 
the timing of revenue recognition on these agreements may be affected by the following factors which involve uncertainty our development schedule  our product s performance  delivery of our product  customer acceptance of our product  which may not occur until some time after we first deliver the product  and timing of payments which are associated with product acceptance 
difficulties in predicting revenue from these arrangements may cause revenue to vary from our forecasts  and as a result  may cause our operating results to decline 
in addition  failure to enter into new development arrangements that replace revenue recognized from past development arrangements could cause total revenues to decline 

table of contents our officers and persons affiliated with our directors hold a substantial portion of our stock and could reject mergers or other business combinations that a shareholder may believe to be desirable as of december   our directors  officers and individuals or entities affiliated with our directors owned of our outstanding common stock as a group 
acting together  these shareholders would be able to significantly influence all matters that our shareholders vote upon  including the election of directors or the rejection of a merger or other business combination that other shareholders may believe to be desirable 
our common stock may be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control  which may prevent our shareholders from reselling our common stock at a profit the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over recent years and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
for example  our stock had closing prices ranging between a high of and a low of during the months ended december  this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions including the war in iraq  terrorist activity or other acts of violence could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 
furthermore  because our stock generally trades at relatively low volumes  any sudden increase in trading volumes can cause significant volatility in the stock price 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors  and in response  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs  liabilities and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we may not be able to effectively compete against other providers of products that design fpgas and asics as a result of their greater financial resources  product offerings and distribution channels  which could cause our sales to decline we face significant competition from larger companies that market suites of semiconductor design software products that address all or almost all steps of semiconductor design or which incorporate intellectual property components for semiconductors 
these competitors have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
we believe that cadence  mentor graphics  synopsys and magma  each of which is also currently competing with us by marketing certain logic synthesis or verification products  could provide suites of products or individual products that include the functionality we currently provide in our products and at lower prices  or may otherwise have more favorable relationships with customers 
if these or other vendors provide lower cost logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification products that outperform our products in addition to having broader applications of their existing product lines  our products could become difficult to sell 
in addition  we believe our asic synthesis and physical synthesis products must provide substantially higher quality and value to potential customers for us to be successful in obtaining meaningful market share in the asic software tools market 
even if our competitors standard products offer functionality equivalent to that of our products  we face a substantial risk that a significant number of customers would elect to pay a premium for similar functionality rather than purchase products from a less well known vendor 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price or market share reductions  or higher selling expenses 
our revenue could be reduced if larger semiconductor design software companies make acquisitions in order to join their extensive distribution capabilities with our competitors products larger semiconductor design software vendors  such as cadence  mentor graphics  synopsys and magma  may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with other companies that may offer or develop competitive products 
because larger semiconductor design software vendors have significant financial and organizational resources  they may be able to further penetrate the logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification markets by 
table of contents leveraging the technology and expertise of smaller companies and utilizing their own extensive distribution channels 
we expect that the semiconductor design software product industry will continue to consolidate  as evidenced by recently announced acquisitions of nassda corporation by synopsys and verisity ltd 
by cadence 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
our revenue may decline if other vendors products are no longer compatible with ours or other vendors bundle their products with those of our competitors and sell them at lower prices our ability to sell our products depends in part on the compatibility of our products with other vendors semiconductor design software and verification products 
these vendors may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products or may restrict our access to their products  either physically or economically 
some vendors already bundle their products with other logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification products and sell the bundle at lower prices  and more vendors may do so in the future 
as a result  any of these factors may negatively affect our ability to offer commercially viable or competitive products or may reduce sales of  or increase costs for  our products 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property rights and other vendors could challenge our intellectual property rights our products are differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed technology that is incorporated into our products 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  other vendors could sell logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification products with features similar to ours  which could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have filed a number of patent applications and to date have been issued or allowed patents  all of which are us patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally seek to control access to our intellectual property rights and the distribution of our logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
there is the possibility that the validity of some of our patents may be challenged in the future 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the copyrights and trade secrets we own 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the united states 
for example  with respect to our sales and support operations in india  indian laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states  and indian statutory law does not protect service marks 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award although we have not been subject to infringement litigation in the past  substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
we expect that logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we are not aware that our products employ technology that infringes any valid proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and or damage awards  
table of contents divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business because we would not be able to sell the impacted product without exposing ourselves to litigation risk and damages 
furthermore  redevelopment of the product so as to avoid infringement would cause us to incur significant additional expense 
although we maintain general business insurance  it does not cover infringement claims 
we would be required to pay any damages and legal expenses from a successful claim ourselves 
in addition  because we also provide standard warranties against and indemnification for the potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights to our customers  we would be financially exposed to satisfy these obligations to our customers 
significant errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us because our logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products are complex  our products could fail to perform as anticipated or produce semiconductors that contain errors which go undetected at any point in the customers design cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with users through our customer support service organization to identify and correct errors in our software and other product problems  errors in our products may be found in the future 
although a number of these errors may prove to be immaterial  many of these errors could be significant 
the detection of any significant errors may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  delays in shipping dates for our products  diversion of development resources from new products to fix errors in existing products  injury to our reputation  costs of corrective actions or returns of defective products  reduction in rates of maintenance renewals  or product liability claims or damage awards 
we warrant that our products will operate in accordance with certain specifications 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert and collect on claims for damages 
although we maintain general business insurance  our coverage does not extend to product liability claims and we cannot assure that our resources would be sufficient to pay a damages award if one were to arise 
moreover  because our products are used in connection with other vendors products that are used to design complex fpgas and asics  significant liability claims may be asserted against us if our products do not work properly  individually or with other vendors products 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims and we do not insure against such liabilities 
regardless of their merit  liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation and divert management s attention from other business pursuits 
if successful  a product liability claim could require us to pay significant damages 
any claim  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 

table of contents as we expand our international operations  we are subject to additional risks and exposures  including economic conditions in foreign locations  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  political and regulatory conditions and other risks customers outside north america accounted for approximately  million and million of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
although international revenue has grown over the last few years  we experienced effects of the economic downturn during in parts of europe and japan  and experienced negative effects from the sars epidemic on our asia business during a return of such economic conditions  or an extension of such conditions to other international locations  would adversely impact our business 
we have international offices in the united kingdom  france  germany  the netherlands  sweden  israel  india  japan  korea  taiwan and the people s republic of china 
we also rely on indirect sales in asia  europe and elsewhere 
our sales contracts generally provide for payment for our products in us dollars 
however  direct sales to our customers in japan are in yen and we expect all such future sales there will be denominated in yen 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the japanese yen 
our expenses incurred in foreign locations are generally denominated in the respective local currency  and as a result  our future revenue and expense levels from international operations may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations 
although we have increased our international sales activities  we still have limited experience in marketing and directly selling our products internationally 
our international operations may be subject to other risks  including relatively higher personnel and operating costs which may not result in additional revenue  revenue may not be sufficient to cover the expenses associated with establishing a new or expanded international location  the impact of local economic conditions  such as interest rate increases or inflation  which may lead to higher cost of capital and lower demand for products  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including tariffs  government ownership of communications systems or laws relating to use of and sales over the internet  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  including taxes due on the exercise of stock options or purchase of shares under employee plans by foreign employees and the impact of expiry of tax holidays or applicability of withholding or value added taxes  foreign currency fluctuations  political instability  which may limit the design of fpgas and or asics in asia or reduce government or private sector spending on networking and communications equipment  and the impact of epidemic situations such as the sars epidemic that occurred in we may not be successful in integrating the businesses or technologies that we may acquire  or the expected benefits may not be realized as projected in  we acquired products and technology from iota and bridgessilicon 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future as a part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product offerings 
in addition to added direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including integration of the acquired products and employees into our business  integration of sales channels and training of our sales force for new product offerings  failure to realize expected synergies  
table of contents failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  assumption of unknown liabilities  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
while we make efforts to analyze acquisition candidates carefully  we cannot be certain that any completed acquisitions will positively impact our business 
future acquisitions could also subject us to significant asset impairment or restructuring charges 
we rely on the services of key personnel  particularly those in our engineering and sales organizations whose knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace  and turnover or other personnel issues in those organizations could negatively impact our revenue our products and technologies are complex and we rely on experienced and knowledgeable research and development and sales personnel 
we depend substantially on the continued service of gary meyers  our president and chief executive officer  and kenneth s 
mcelvain  our chief technology officer  vice president and a founder 
we also depend on our sales personnel  particularly in certain areas of europe and asia where we employ a relatively small sales team 
for example  we recently experienced weakness in certain of our asian sales locations due to reorganization within our asia sales force 
there are a limited number of qualified people with the technical skills and understanding of fpgas and asics and or eda software necessary to our business  and if we are unable to retain or find suitable replacements for any turnover in our engineering and sales organizations  our business could be adversely affected 
modifications to our effective tax rates or government reviews of our tax returns could affect our results of operations we are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign locations 
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes involves judgment and estimates and we cannot be certain that no subsequent adjustments will be needed should updated information become available 
future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our foreign tax estimates  the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws 
we have been subject to tax audits in the past including income  sales and property tax audits  and may be subject to additional domestic and international tax audits in the future 
for example  we are currently undergoing an audit of our united states federal income tax return for although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot be certain that the results of this audit or any other audit will not require any adjustments to our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed during this audit or a future audit  our operating results or financial position could be materially affected 
proposed changes in financial accounting standards related to equity compensation will cause us to record additional expense in the future  which would result in a reduction in our net income in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which will be effective in the third quarter of sfas r will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this standard  we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or related to the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plan 
under the new standard  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
the stock based compensation section of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements shown below provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during  and 
table of contents corporate governance regulations have recently increased our costs as a result of attaining compliance  which could further increase our expenses if changes occur within our business changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  have imposed new requirements on us and on our officers  directors  attorneys and independent accountants 
in order to comply with these new rules  we have added internal resources and have utilized additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  which have increased and are likely to continue increasing our operating expenses 
in particular  we expect to incur additional administrative expenses as we maintain compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls 
in addition  if we undergo significant modifications to our structure through personnel or system changes  acquisitions  or otherwise  it may be increasingly difficult to maintain compliance with the existing and evolving corporate governance regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell those products primarily in north america  europe and japan 
our revenue from sales outside north america was  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
with the exception of sales in japan  our sales are generally made in us dollars  thus a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries excluding japan is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our japanese subsidiary is the yen 
the effects of translation of our foreign subsidiaries for which the us dollar is the functional currency are included in the results of operations  and to date have not been material 
the effects of translation of our japanese subsidiary are included in shareholders equity and to date have not been material 
historically  our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been minimal 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by basis points from rates as of december   the effect on our operating results and financial position would not be material 
however  as our international sales and operations have expanded  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has increased  particularly in japan 
in january  we began entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the japanese yen 
the outstanding forward contracts generally have maturities of approximately one month from the date into which they were entered and are entered into at or near the end of the month 
these contracts are remeasured monthly using spot rates  with any gain or loss from rate fluctuations recorded in the statement of operations 
the changes in the values of the forward contracts were not material for the year ended december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the change in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and or money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted primarily of us government agency notes  money market funds and certificates of deposit and our short term investments consisted of us government agency notes  corporate notes  bankers acceptance  and certificates of deposit
