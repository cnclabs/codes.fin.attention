overview business we are a specialty coffee roaster  wholesaler and retailer 
we sell brewed  espresso based and various blended beverages primarily made from our own fresh roasted premium coffee beans  as well as light food items  whole bean coffee and accessories  through our company operated and franchised retail locations 
we also sell whole bean and ground coffees on a wholesale basis in the office coffee service market and to other wholesale customers  including restaurant chains and other retailers 
we roast coffee at our coffee roasting facility in central california 
it supplies freshly roasted coffee to our company operated and franchised retail locations and to our wholesale accounts 
our brands include diedrich coffee  gloria jean s  and coffee people 
the diedrich coffee and coffee people brands are primarily company store operations and the gloria jean s brand is primarily a franchised store operation 
as of june   we owned and operated retail locations and franchised other retail locations under these brands  for a total of retail coffee outlets 
our retail units are located in states 
as of june   we had over wholesale accounts with office coffee service distributors  chain and independent restaurants  and others 
although the specialty coffee industry is dominated by a single company with almost  domestic locations  we are one of the nation s largest specialty coffee retailers 
our system wide revenues are more than million 
system wide revenues include sales from company operated and franchise locations 

table of contents we believe that our company is differentiated from other specialty coffee companies by the quality of our coffee products  the superior personalized customer service provided to our customers and the warm and friendly ambiance offered by our coffeehouses 
we serve our distinctively roasted coffee products in all of our brand locations and an extensive variety of fine quality flavored whole bean coffees are offered in our gloria jean s units 
our roasting recipes take into account the specific variety  origin and physical characteristics of each coffee bean to maximize its unique flavor 
key performance indicators we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these include same store sales growth  the number of company operated and franchised stores opened and closed  and the measured relationship of cost of sales and related occupancy costs  operating expenses and general and administrative expenses to sales 
same store sales growth  or comparative sales growth  is a primary statistic used in the retail industry to measure core revenues 
this measure compares sales for all units open for one year or more to the comparable prior year period 
we use this measure to evaluate single coffeehouse  total brand  and total company sales performance 
until recently  comparable sales of our company operated stores and domestic franchised stores had declined  primarily as a result of aging stores  a lack of capital to fund store improvements  and no new store openings 
new stores typically achieve relatively strong comparative sales growth in their early years 
franchised units that are located in malls have also experienced declining sales due to overall declines in mall traffic 
our ability to open new company operated and franchise stores depends on our success in raising capital and selling franchises 
continuing declines in same store sales could result in store closures  make sales of franchises more difficult and have a material adverse impact on our future performance 
the number of operating units opened and closed is also a measure of the health of our brands and our business  although it is affected by a number of factors  including the availability of capital to finance growth 
in recent years the number of domestic units has declined because the number of aging units closing exceeded the number of new units opening 
company operated stores have increased and franchised stores have decreased 
unlike new company operated stores  new franchised stores do not require our capital 
in addition  franchised stores typically make an immediate profit contribution  whereas company stores generally are not profitable in the first year 
our near term growth plans focus primarily on franchising new domestic stores 
failure to successfully expand our franchise operations would materially adversely impact our future performance 
we use the relationship between cost of sales and related occupancy costs and operating expenses to sales to measure the operating efficiency of our individual coffeehouses and to measure the relationship between general and administrative expenses to sales to monitor and control the level of corporate overhead 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased in the current fiscal year due to the higher percentage of the higher cost keurig k cup business 
in total  wholesale sales which carry a higher costs of goods sold than retail sales  increased as a percentage of the total retail and wholesale sales mix 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs declined in the prior fiscal year as a result of the sale of high cost  low margin retail units and due to our exiting the unprofitable wholesale grocery chain distribution channel 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales have increased in the past two years as a result of dedicating more in store labor and supervision to the retail stores 
general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of sales due to staffing for accelerated growth and due to the effect of continuing declines in sales  until fiscal  on a relatively fixed expense base

ltd  formerly the gloria jean s master franchisee for australia  and certain of its affiliates collectively  jireh for  in cash and an additional  payable over the next six years under license  roasting and consulting agreements 
the sale resulted in a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations of  net of  in taxes 
the tax expense associated with the discontinued operations differed from the statutory federal effective tax rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and permanently nondeductible goodwill associated with the discontinued operations 
the sale included immediate transfer of franchise rights to jireh of gloria jean s retail locations outside the us and puerto rico  including in australia 
after all payments have been made to us under the license  roasting and consulting agreements  all remaining gloria jean s trademarks  including those in the us  will be transferred to jireh 
concurrent with such future transfer  our us based gloria jean s subsidiary will enter into a perpetual  royalty free master franchise agreement with jireh under which we will continue to have exclusive rights to operate  franchise and develop gloria jean s locations throughout the us and puerto rico and to continue our wholesale operations under the gloria jean s coffees brand in these same markets 
we agreed to not compete internationally through our diedrich coffee and coffee people brands for a period of two years from the date of sale 
other than that restriction  our domestic gloria jean s outlets  our 
table of contents castroville roasting operations  our wholesale operations and our company operated diedrich coffee and coffee people retail outlets were not significantly affected by this transaction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the financial results of gloria jean s international franchise operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenue 
our revenue from continuing operations for the year ended june  increased by  to  from  for the year ended june  this result was the net effect of a increase in retail sales  a increase in wholesale sales and a decrease in domestic franchise revenue 
each component of total revenue is discussed below 
retail sales 
our retail sales revenue for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to a company operated same store sales increase of  and a net increase of four company stores since the beginning of the prior year 
retail sales from our internet website also increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal wholesale revenue 
our wholesale sales for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this increase was primarily the net result of the following factors keurig k cup and other third party wholesale sales 
third party wholesale sales increased  or to  led by strong growth in the keurig k cup sales which increased by 
roasted coffee sales to franchisees 
sales of roasted coffee to our franchisees decreased  for the year ended june  because of a net decrease of domestic franchise stores since the beginning of the fiscal year and compounded by negative same store sales in fiscal for the gloria jean s domestic system which reduced roasted coffee usage 
franchise revenue 
our domestic franchise revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  our franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees  franchise renewal fees  area development fees  royalties received on sales at franchised locations  and miscellaneous other franchise revenue  including coordination fees received from product suppliers 
the decrease in domestic franchise revenue was primarily due to the net impact of a store decrease in units as new units opened but closed during the past two fiscal years  and also due to negative same store sales which affected royalties 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from in fiscal to in fiscal because none of these costs relate to franchise revenue  the most relevant benchmark of these costs is their relationship to total retail and wholesale sales 
using that measure  cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased as a percentage of total retail and wholesale sales from in fiscal to in fiscal retail cost of sales remained relatively stable  but wholesale cost of sales increased from to of wholesale sales in fiscal due to a higher percentage of higher cost keurig business in the current year 
wholesale sales that carry a higher cost of goods sold than retail sales  also increased as a percentage of the retail and wholesale sales mix from to 

table of contents operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended june   as a percentage of retail and wholesale sales  increased modestly  increasing from of retail and wholesale sales in fiscal to in the current year 
retail operating expenses increased from of retail sales in fiscal to in the current year primarily due to increased labor and supervision costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was relatively stable increasing  or to  for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expense increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue for the year ended june  from of total revenue for the year ended june  this unfavorable margin basis point change for the current year was primarily the result of a  increase in costs related to actual and planned store growths in areas such as marketing  franchise sales  real estate  technology and development   in increased independent audit and financial staffing costs  increased cost of gloria jean s franchisee meetings of  and a  workers compensation refund received in the prior fiscal year period 
provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs 
no provision was required in fiscal a provision of  was recorded in the prior year 
interest expense and other  net 
interest expense  interest income and other income  net which was an expense of  in the year ended june   was income of  in the year ended june  this change was due to a lower level of outstanding debt in the current year and interest income on our increased cash generated from the proceeds on the sale of the international franchise operations 
income tax benefit 
we had losses from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations for the years ended june  and june  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the income tax benefit generated by the loss from continuing operations were  and  for the years ended june  and june   respectively 
due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the sale of the gloria jean s international franchise operations and following an internal revenue code section analysis  as of june   net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of  are available to be utilized against future taxable income for years through fiscal  subject to possible annual limitation pertaining to change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating loss carryforwards have been fully reserved 
as of june   there were no net operating loss carryforwards available for state income tax purposes 
results of discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the international gloria jean s franchise operations on february  the results from this component of our business are presented as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended june  and june  in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the year ended june  net income from discontinued operations was  net of  in taxes  including a gain of  net of  in taxes 
the tax expense associated with the discontinued operations differed from the statutory federal effective tax rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and permanently nondeductible goodwill associated with the discontinued operations 
in the year ended june  income from discontinued operations was  net of taxes of  year ended june  compared to year ended july  total revenue 
total revenue from continuing operations for the year ended june  decreased by  to  from  for the year ended july  this result was the net effect of a 
table of contents decrease in retail sales and franchise revenue  offset by an increase in wholesale sales 
each component of total revenue is discussed below 
retail sales 
our retail sales revenue for the year ended june  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily related to a lower number of company stores partially offset by higher same store sales 
during the year  five company stores were closed and a net of two stores were transferred to us from franchisees 
the retail sales decrease is attributable to sales lost from the year over year company store count decline of approximately  which was partially offset by the increase in comparable store sales for company operated units  approximately  retail sales from our internet website also increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal wholesale and other 
our wholesale revenue for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended july  this increase was primarily the net result of the following factors keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales  along with other non contract sales  achieved sales growth in fiscal  increasing  to roasted coffee sales to franchisees 
sales of roasted coffee to our franchisees decreased  for the year ended june  because of a decrease in the number of domestic franchise stores in the current fiscal year 
this resulted from the closure of gloria jean s domestic franchise locations 
the decrease in domestic store count was compounded by a decrease of in gloria jean s domestic system comparable sales that also reduced roasted coffee usage 
coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers 
wholesale coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers decreased  or  from the prior year 
this segment is being de emphasized due to its relatively low profitability 
coffee sales to grocery retailers 
the grocery retail segment proved to be unprofitable and we exited this distribution channel early in fiscal sales for the year were  a decrease of  from the prior year 
franchise revenue 
our domestic franchise revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended july  our franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees  franchise renewal fees  area development fees  royalties received on sales at franchised locations  and miscellaneous other franchise revenue  including coordination fees received from product suppliers 
the decrease in franchise revenue was primarily due to the reduction in domestic franchise royalties which declined by  primarily due to the six store net decrease in the number of gloria jean s domestic franchise locations compared to the prior year and the decrease in gloria jean s franchise comparable store sales 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs declined from in fiscal to in fiscal because none of these costs relate to franchise revenue  the most relevant benchmark of these costs is their relationship to total retail and wholesale sales 
using that measure  cost of sales and related occupancy costs declined as a percentage of total retail and wholesale sales from in fiscal to in fiscal overall cost of sales remained relatively stable  although wholesale cost of sales declined by  primarily due to our exiting the high cost retail grocery distribution channel early in fiscal retail cost of sales declined by  primarily due to the closure of five company operated stores 
occupancy costs declined by  primarily due to the retail stores with high occupancy costs that were closed in the past year 

table of contents market prices for coffee beans increased significantly during fiscal  although the market prices for specialty coffee beans rose at a lower rate 
because we typically have commitments for approximately of our coffee bean requirements  the increase did not affect fiscal cost of goods sold and margins significantly 
dairy prices also increased approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal if commodity prices remain at the increased levels  an upward adjustment in our retail prices may be necessary 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended june  declined by to  from  for the year ended july  however  as a percentage of total retail and wholesale sales  operating expenses increased slightly  from of retail and wholesale sales for the year ended july  to for the year ended june  retail operating expenses increased primarily as a result of increased staffing in the coffeehouses and additional supervision of these units as well as higher marketing costs 
wholesale operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of our exiting the retail grocery distribution channel in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  this increase is primarily due to the store re imaging and improvement program conducted during fiscal and as a result of acquiring additional machinery and equipment for our castroville roasting facility 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expense increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue for the year ended june  from of total revenue for the year ended july  this unfavorable margin change for the current year was primarily the result of a  increase in salaries due to additional staffing in the franchise development and construction areas in preparation for a planned acceleration of unit growth 
provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs 
asset impairment and restructuring costs declined from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year provisions for asset impairment and restructuring costs arise as a result of regular reviews of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
provisions for asset impairment and restructuring costs may also arise as a result of our regular reviews of purchased goodwill and certain other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the use of a non amortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain other intangible assets  and provides for a review for possible impairment of these assets at least annually 
sfas no 
also provides for a review of possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
gain on asset disposals 
gain on asset disposals declined from  for the year ended july  to  for the year ended june  this fiscal gain was primarily related to a net gain of  from the sales and closures of nine locations partially offset by the write off of equipment from other closed locations 
interest expense and other  net 
interest expense and other  net increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended july  this increase is primarily due to a write off of  of deferred financing costs incurred in securing loan facilities that were refinanced with proceeds of a new financing completed during fiscal income tax benefit 
we had losses from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations for the years ended june  and july  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the income tax benefit generated by the loss from continuing operations were  and  for the years ended june  and july   respectively

due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating loss carryforwards have been fully reserved 
results of discontinued operations 
as a result of the sale of the international gloria jean s franchise operations on february  the results from this segment are presented as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended june  and july  in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the year ended june  net income from discontinued operations was  net of taxes of  in the year ended july  income from discontinued operations was  net of taxes of  the  increase was a result of an increase of international units during the year and a gain on an area development termination 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity and capital resources current financial condition at june   we had working capital of  total long term debt  capital lease obligations  deferred rent and stock warrants of  and  of stockholders equity  compared to a working capital of  total long term debt  capital lease obligations and deferred rent of  and  of stockholders equity at june  as a result of the restructuring of our credit agreements as described in outstanding debt and financing arrangements below  available credit under our credit agreements increased from approximately  at june  to  at june  cash flows the following is a summary of our cash flows for the three years ended june  fiscal years ended june  june  july  cash flows provided by operating activities net income loss less income from discontinued operations  net gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net loss from continuing operations net non cash charges to income net increase decrease in operating assets net increase in operating liabilities cash flows provided by used in continuing operating activities cash flows provided by used in discontinued operations cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year capital commitments at end of year the decrease in cash from continuing operations in fiscal year as compared to fiscal years and is more fully enumerated in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
working capital requirements tend to be seasonal  with inventories and receivables increasing before the holiday season and declining in the post holiday period 
planned new store growth will initially have the effect of increasing working capital requirements and decreasing cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flow provided by discontinued operating activities is primarily the results of international franchise operations before the sale in february cash provided by investing activities from the fiscal year ended june  increased  from cash used of  in fiscal to cash provided of  in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the sale of international operations for  in cash offset by capital expenditures of  
table of contents the decrease in cash flows used in financing activities is the result of a net reduction of long term debt and capital lease obligations from fiscal to fiscal cash flows used in fiscal increased from fiscal due to an increase in payments on long term debt 
we had capital commitments at the end of the fiscal year totaling  of which  relates to opening new stores and  for remodeling  equipment and software upgrades for company operated retail units and the castroville roasting facility 
capital commitments at the end of the fiscal year totaled  of which  relates to opening a new store and  for remodeling and equipment for company operated retail units 
capital commitments at the end of the fiscal year relate to remodeling company operated retail units 
outstanding debt and financing arrangements on may   we entered into a  contingent convertible note purchase agreement 
the agreement provides for us to  at our election  issue notes up to an aggregate principal amount of  issued notes will be amortized on a monthly basis at a rate that will repay of the principal amount of each note by may  the remaining will mature on that date 
interest is payable at libor plus  and a facility fee of annually is payable on the unused portion of the facility 
the agreement contains covenants that limit the amount of indebtedness that we may have outstanding in relation to our tangible net worth and that require us to maintain a specified minimum dollar value of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization for the trailing four fiscal quarters 
notes are convertible into our common stock only upon certain changes of control 
for notes issued and repaid  warrants to purchase shares will be issued with the same rights and restrictions for exercise as existed for convertibility of the notes at the time of their issuance 
warrants are exercisable only in the event of a change of control and expire on may  the lender under this agreement is a limited partnership of which the chairman of our board of directors serves as the sole general partner 
on may   upon entering into the agreement  we immediately issued a  note under the facility  and used the proceeds from that note and other available cash to repay all outstanding debt with bank of the west 
on september   we issued a second note for  under this facility 
as of june   no debt was outstanding under the facility 
the company was in compliance with the covenants contained in its financing agreements at june  no amounts were outstanding and the full amounts are available for borrowing at that date 
on may   we also entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of the west 
the agreement provides for a working capital facility of  and a letter of credit facility of  at june  no debt was outstanding under the working capital facility and  of letters of credit were outstanding under the letter of credit facility 
based upon the terms of our credit agreements  as amended  our recent operating performance and business outlook  and status of our balance sheet  we believe that cash from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and funds available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs at the anticipated operating levels for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital leases including interest company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases green coffee commitments the company also has entered into employment agreements with its president and chief executive officer and two other senior executive officers that provide for severance payments in the event that these individuals are terminated without cause or that they terminate their employment as a result of a constructive termination 
these severance payments range from six months to one year s salary 
the company s maximum liability for severance under the contracts is currently  because such amounts are contingent they have not been included in the above table 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for our coffee houses  roasting facility and administrative offices 
lease terms are generally for to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
some retail leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
in addition  we are liable on the master leases for gloria jean s franchise locations 
under our historical franchising business model  we executed the master leases for these locations  and entered into subleases on the same terms with our franchisees  which typically pay their rent directly to the landlords 
should any of these franchisees default on their subleases  we would be responsible for making payments thereunder 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at june   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases  was  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures that we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump sum payment to the landlord that is less than the sum of all remaining future rents and other amounts payable 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
accounts significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  franchise receivables  allowance for bad debt reserves  fixed asset lives  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  self insurance and workers compensation reserves  store closure reserves  stock based compensation  the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion  however  does not list all of our accounting policies and estimates 
impairment of property and equipment and other amortizable long lived assets held and used each quarter  or upon the occurrence of a triggering event as defined in sfas no 
 we evaluate the carrying value of individual stores when the operating results have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately 
table of contents evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or a current expectation that a store will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the store was opened or remodeled  and the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth 
for stores selected for review  we estimate the future cash flows from operating the store over its estimated useful life 
we make judgments about future same store sales and the operating expenses and estimated useful life that we would expect with such level of same store sales 
the most significant assumptions in our analysis are those used when we estimate a unit s future cash flows 
we generally use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on unit specific information 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating unit assets may be overstated or understated 
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has likely occurred 
we consider the reporting unit level to be the segment level since the components within each segment have similar economic characteristics  including products and services  production processes  types or classes of customers and distribution methods 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the segment 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future net cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider historical results as well as the assumptions utilized in our strategic plan for items such as same store sales  store count growth rates  and the discount rate we consider to be the market discount rate used for acquisitions of similar businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the segments may ultimately prove to be significantly higher or lower  thereby causing the carrying value to be less than or to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has or has not occurred 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our goodwill may be understated or overstated 
our annual impairment measurement date is our fiscal year end 
estimated liability for closing stores we make decisions to close stores based on prospects for estimated future profitability and sometimes we are forced to close stores due to circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new lease 
our management team evaluates each store s performance every period 
when stores continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of an unprofitable store 
based on the management team s judgment  we estimate the future net cash flows 
if we determine that the store will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  and we are not contractually obligated to continue operating the store  we may close the store 
additionally  franchisees may close stores for which we are the primary lessee 
if the franchisee cannot make payments on the lease  we continue making the lease payments and establish an estimated liability for the closed store if we decide not to operate it as a company operated store 
effective january   we establish the estimated liability on the actual closure date which is generally the date on which we cease to receive economic benefit from the unit 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january   we established the estimated liability when we identified a store for closure  which may or may not have been the actual closure date 
we also review the net cash flows to determine the need to provide for asset impairment 
the estimated liability for closing stores on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee that we expect to pay  as well as the estimated maintenance costs that we expect to 
table of contents pay until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability is generally the present value of the estimated future payments 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown in provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs or cost of sales and related occupancy  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing stores is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant stores  which we determine based on our assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early terminations of our lease agreements with the lessors or to sublease the property 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or sublease or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant stores are not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant stores are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities through the line item in which it was originally recorded  resulting in an increase in operating income 
estimated liability for self insurance and workers compensation we are self insured for a portion of our current year s losses related to workers compensation insurance 
we have obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation claims with a  deductible per occurrence and a program maximum for all claims of  insurance liabilities and reserves are accounted for based on the present value of actuarial estimates of the amount of incurred and unpaid losses  based approximately on a risk free interest rate 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
management  in determining the estimated liability  bases the assumptions on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development we estimated in conjunction with the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve 
as a result  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims are greater than expected  then we may adjust the expected losses upward and our future self insurance expenses will rise 
franchised operations we monitor the financial condition of certain franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each period we perform an analysis to develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
over time  our assessment of individual franchisees may change 
for instance  we have had franchisees for whom we had estimated a loss equal to the total amount of their receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we or our franchisees may take to resolve franchise collections issues 
these actions may include the purchase of franchise stores by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement  which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future  a restructuring of the franchisee s business or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary or secondary obligee or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   an estimated liability for future lease obligations on stores operated by franchisees for which we are the primary or secondary obligee is 
table of contents established on the date the franchisee closes the store 
also  we record an estimated liability for subsidized lease payments when we sign a sublease agreement committing us to the subsidy 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing stores above 
consistent with sfas no 
 we have not established an additional estimated liability for potential losses not yet incurred 
if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised stores 
in addition  entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
stock based compensation as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various stock based compensation plans that provide options for certain employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of stock 
we have elected to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which utilizes the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  as opposed to using the fair value method prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
because of this election  we are required to make certain disclosures of pro forma net income assuming we had adopted sfas no 
we determine the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including our historical stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for analysis of the effect of certain changes in assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies as discussed above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
if we have been profitable for a number of years and our prospects for the realization of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not  we would then reverse our valuation allowance and credit income tax expense 
in assessing the prospects for future profitability  many of the assessments of same store sales and cash flows discussed above become relevant 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from future taxable income 
as of june   our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance totaled approximately  new accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends fasb statements and sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  and will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june  this new standard may be adopted in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
the company does not currently anticipate that the impact on net income on a full year basis of the adoption of sfas r will be significantly different from the historical pro forma impacts as disclosed in accordance with sfas other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as well as economic trends that affect retailers in general 
historically  our net sales have not been realized proportionately in each quarter  with net sales being the highest 
table of contents during the second fiscal quarter  which includes the november december holiday season 
hot weather tends to negatively impact sales 
quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  which may not occur as anticipated due to events outside our control 
as a result of these factors  and of the other contingencies and risk factors described elsewhere in this report  the financial results for any individual quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive items entered into for trading purposes none 
market risk sensitive items entered into for other than trading purposes we have exposure to market risk from two primary sources interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
at june   we had a  loan facility and a  working capital facility  both with no outstanding balance  each of which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
at fiscal year end  the interest rates ranged from to 
commodity price risk green coffee  the principal raw material for our products  is subject to significant price fluctuations caused by a number of factors  including weather  political  and economic conditions 
to date  we have not used commodity based financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in the price of green coffee 
to ensure that we have an adequate supply of green coffee  however  we enter into agreements to purchase green coffee in the future that may or may not be fixed as to price 
at june   we had commitments to purchase coffee through fiscal year  totaling  for  pounds of green coffee  the majority of which were fixed as to price 
the coffee scheduled to be delivered to us in fiscal year pursuant to these commitments will satisfy approximately of our anticipated green coffee requirements for the fiscal year 
assuming we require approximately  additional pounds of green coffee during fiscal for which no price has yet been fixed  each per pound increase in the price of green coffee could result in  of additional cost 
however  because the price we pay for green coffee is negotiated with suppliers  we believe that the commodity market price for green coffee would have to increase significantly  by as much as per pound  before suppliers would increase the price they charge us
