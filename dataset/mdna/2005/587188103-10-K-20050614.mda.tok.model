item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information in the business section of this report 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue  net of discounts  returns  and rebates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
as required by these standards  revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are met  and sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon the shipment of products  or in the case of consignment inventories  upon the notification of usage by the customer 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and other volume based incentives 
should the actual level of customer participation in these programs differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
we also allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
we record an allowance for estimated returns at the time of sale based on historical experience  recent gross sales levels and any notification of pending returns 
should the actual returns differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue and cost of sales may be required 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  canada and western europe 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers  primarily hospitals  doctors and distributors 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers  or the economy as whole  were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances for estimated losses would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost  based on the first in first out fifo cost method  or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required 
these additional valuation adjustments would be included in cost of sales 
warranties and related reserves we provide an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties and product liability claims at the time revenue is recognized 
such accruals are based on estimates  which are based on relevant factors such as historical experience  the warranty period  estimated costs  levels of insurance and insurance retentions  identified product quality issues  if any  and  to a limited extent  information developed by the insurance company using actuarial techniques 
these accruals are analyzed periodically for adequacy 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by reported rates of product problems and costs incurred in correcting product problems 
should actual reported problem rates or the resulting costs differ from our estimates  adjustments to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these adjustments would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  we evaluate goodwill and other intangibles annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  and analyzed goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
impairment tests were performed at adoption  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal years and  and no impairment was noted as a result of these analyses 
the impairment tests performed in fiscal indicated certain impaired assets  for which we recorded impairment charges in fiscal these impairment charges are included in the results of operations 
see note i intangible assets and goodwill of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative research and development severance charges restructuring long lived asset impairment charges operating income interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income years ended march  and sales net sales for fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in net sales for fiscal resulted from an increase in net sales in both the domestic and international markets 
foreign exchange rate movements  primarily the stronger euro  had a favorable year to year impact on international net sales of million  or approximately three percentage points of the year over year growth 
we expect our net sales to increase in fiscal at a low double digit rate over net sales in fiscal we have three principal product lines  each of which constitutes one of our business segments 
set forth below is a summary of our net sales for each of the last two fiscal years  by segment 
net sales by principal product line in thousands percent change aesthetic general surgery products surgical urology products clinical consumer healthcare products net sales of aesthetic and general surgery products increased to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of breast implant products increased to million from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in breast implant products is attributable to organic growth in unit sales of our breast implants and associated products and approximately million is the result of a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
increased net sales were driven by growth in the augmentation and reconstruction markets both domestically and internationally 
we saw overall growth in domestic unit sales of breast implant products of approximately 
although we try to avoid competing on price  we continue to see competitive price pressure in both the domestic and international markets for breast implants 
net sales of body contouring products increased to million from million in the prior year 
liposuction continues to be the leading surgical cosmetic procedure in the united states  and sales of our capital equipment  associated disposable products  and higher average selling prices were the leading contributors to our body contouring sales growth 
other aesthetic products net sales increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily as a result of increased revenue from physician participation in our extreme mentor direct to consumer television advertising program 
we expect to continue our direct to consumer advertising programs into fiscal net sales of surgical urology products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the fastest growing product area was our women s health offering  in which net sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to our obtape trans obturator sling  which was introduced in the united states in august for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence 
net sales of our disposable urinary care products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the majority of this increase was attributable to increased sales at our international branches  which also received the benefit of favorable exchange rate movements 
penile implant sales increased to million  from million in the prior year  due to increased market acceptance of our titan penile device  which carries a higher average selling price than its predecessor product  the alpha i  both domestically and in europe  and a reduction in the trend of patients sampling competitive drug therapies for erectile dysfunction  which had negatively impacted prior year sales 
brachytherapy product net sales increased by to million  from million in the prior year  primarily as a result of higher unit sales due to the absence of supply interruptions  which occurred in the prior year 
the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate variations for the surgical urology product segment  which primarily benefits our disposable urinary care products  was million for the year 
net sales of clinical and consumer healthcare products increased to million from million in the prior year 
net sales growth was generally aided by the effect of the stronger euro as nearly half of these product sales are invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar  this positive effect was approximately million for the segment 
the remainder of the growth is attributable to an overall increase in unit sales in all product groupings  partially offset by decreases in average selling prices 
net sales of intermittent catheters increased  or million to million 
net sales of male external catheters increased  or million  to million 
net sales of other disposable healthcare and ostomy products increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal was of net sales  compared to in fiscal cost of sales for the aesthetic and general surgery products decreased to from of net sales  primarily due to favorable pricing on raw materials and overall improved manufacturing efficiencies at our texas and netherlands facilities 
cost of sales for surgical urology products decreased to from of net sales  primarily due to increased sales of women s health products  which have a higher margin than other surgical urology products 
cost of sales for clinical and consumer healthcare products increased to from of net sales in the prior year  primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies at certain of our foreign manufacturing facilities and lower average selling prices to our international distributors 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal we had generally higher levels of expenses at our foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries of approximately  of which approximately million reflects the effect of foreign currency rate movements  primarily the stronger euro 
also contributing to the increase was approximately million in incentive compensation expenses associated with achieving specific operating targets  our recently launched direct to consumer television advertising program of approximately million  and higher legal related expenses of approximately million due to increased litigation expenses and other legal and corporate matters 
in addition  to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and increased support of sales and marketing contributed to the year over year increase 
the increase in general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower product warranty and product liability expenses of approximately million 
research and development research and development spending primarily supports our key strategic product development programs 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in fiscal the majority of the increase was attributable to the aesthetic and general surgery segment and was primarily due to increased support for our silicone gel filled breast implant regulatory submissions in the united states and canada  increased patient volume in our adjunct study  new clinical studies and laboratory testing for our hyaluronic acid based dermal filler product  puragen  and our botulinum toxin project 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge related to the termination of a brachytherapy development project and related automated manufacturing equipment 
we continue to be committed to a variety of clinical studies and laboratory tests in connection with our gel filled and saline filled mammary implants and other products 
severance charges on february   christopher j 
conway and adel michael each resigned as a director and executive officer of the company 
in connection with resignation and severance agreements entered into with them  we incurred million in expenses in february  as set forth in the table below cash accelerated total expense options severance christopher j 
conway adel michael as one of the co founders of our company  and following years of service  mr 
conway received certain severance compensation in the form of cash payments totaling million and non cash benefits in the amount of million related to the accelerated vesting of his unvested and unexpired stock options 
in addition  mr 
adel michael  our former vice chairman  received severance compensation in the form of cash benefits in the amount of million and non cash benefits in the amount of million related to the accelerated vesting of his unvested and unexpired employee stock options 
restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we incurred million in expenses related certain long lived assets that were determined to be impaired  and restructuring of certain of our operations to achieve improved efficiencies 
the impairment charges totaled million 
of this amount  million related to intangible assets within the surgical urology segment  and million within the aesthetics and general surgery segment 
the restructuring charges totaled million and resulted in a net reduction of approximately of our workforce and the closure of a manufacturing facility in the united kingdom 
of this amount  million related to the aesthetics and general surgery segment  million related to the surgical urology segment  and million related to the clinical and consumer healthcare segment 
interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal approximately million of the expense relates to the coupon and issuance cost amortization for our million convertible subordinated notes issued in december the increase in interest expense is attributable to a full year of interest and amortization of issuance costs on these notes as interest expense for fiscal  included only four months of accrued interest payable and amortization of bond issue costs 
the remaining interest expense is interest on balances outstanding under our foreign lines of credit  which benefited from lower rates of interest and lower levels of borrowings 
interest income increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase is due to higher prevailing interest rates on short term investments  and slightly longer maturities  partially offset by lower levels of cash balances available for investment 
other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales of marketable securities and foreign currency gains or losses related to our foreign operations 
other income decreased to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of the less favorable impact of the euro s relative strength compared to the us dollar  and a decrease in realized and unrealized gains and losses in our portfolio of marketable securities 
these decreases were partially offset by a one time gains of approximately million relating to insurance proceeds received to cover lost sales margin on finished goods inventory that was damaged  and a gain of approximately million relating to the sale of a building in the united kingdom in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes our effective rate of corporate income taxes was in fiscal year  an increase of of pretax income from the rate in fiscal year this increase is a result of higher state taxes and reduced research and development credits  partially offset by greater tax benefits associated with our foreign operations 
net income and earnings per share net income in fiscal increased slightly to million from million in fiscal earnings per share increased to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal diluted earnings per share increased to for the fiscal year compared to a restated for fiscal as required by eitf  we have retroactively restated diluted earnings per share figures for fiscal for the impact of our convertible subordinated notes issued in december the effect of share repurchases was partially offset by the dilutive effect to earnings per share following the adoption of eitf which required the inclusion  for calculation purposes  of additional shares that are contingently issuable 
as a result of our stock repurchase program  we have fewer shares outstanding  resulting in a positive impact on the year over year comparison of diluted earnings per share 
net income in fiscal remained relatively unchanged  although diluted earnings per share was positively impacted by fewer shares outstanding due to our stock repurchase program 
increased net sales and lower cost of goods sold in fiscal were offset by higher operating expenses  including severance  restructuring and long lived asset impairment charges  as well as higher interest expense resulting in net income being essentially unchanged from we expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal to be in the range of to 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition and results of operation for the reporting periods presented in this report 
we cannot be certain that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our business in the future 
years ended march  and net sales net sales for fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in net sales for fiscal resulted from increased sales in both the domestic and international markets 
foreign exchange rate movements  primarily the stronger euro  had a favorable year to year impact on international net sales of million  or approximately five percentage points of the year over year growth 
net sales by principal product line in thousands percent change aesthetic general surgery products surgical urology products clinical consumer healthcare products during fiscal  net sales of aesthetic and general surgery products increased to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of breast implant products increased to million from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in breast implant products is attributable to organic growth in unit sales of our breast implants and associated products and approximately million was the result of favorable foreign exchange rate movements 
net sales of body contouring products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in body contouring product sales was primarily attributable to increased liposuction procedural volumes  as awareness and acceptance of this procedure increased 
in addition  other product net sales increased million  which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of inform solutions  now doing business as mentor solutions  and ancillary product sales 
net sales of surgical urology products in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior year 
increases in net sales of women s health products and disposable urinary care products  along with a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements of million were partially offset by a million decrease in penile implant net sales and a million decrease in brachytherapy product sales from the prior year 
net sales of women s health products increased to million from million in the prior year primarily due to the introduction of the obtape sling to the us market in august and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
net sales of disposable urinary care and other products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
net sales of penile implant products for the year decreased to million from million in the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we restructured our domestic urology sales force and provided cross training across the full range of our urology product line  which we believe attributed to a short term negative impact on our penile implant product sales 
in addition  we believe net sales were also negatively impacted by the recent introduction of new drug therapies for erectile dysfunction in the united states 
brachytherapy net sales decreased million to million from million  a decrease of from the prior year 
this decrease is a result of several factors 
on january   our exclusive distribution and supply agreement with nasi  which was our sole source of iodine and palladium seeds  expired resulting in an interruption of our supply of seeds 
on february   we completed our acquisition of mills biopharmaceuticals  inc and began supplying our customers with iodine seeds manufactured by mills 
in addition  we reached a nonexclusive one year agreement with best medical  inc best to distribute best palladium brachytherapy seeds 
however  due to best s difficulties in increasing manufacturing capacity in a short time frame  and our inability to secure sufficient new vendor supply of palladium brachytherapy seeds  we were unable to fill all customer orders 
in addition  alternative procedures  changes in medicare reimbursement  and additional competitive pressures have decreased procedural volumes and decreased average selling prices of our brachytherapy products 
these market factors and supply interruptions resulted in lost sales of approximately million per quarter for the first three quarters of fiscal and lost sales of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
net sales of clinical and consumer healthcare products in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior year 
net sales growth was generally aided by the effect of the stronger euro as nearly half of these product sales are invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar  this effect was approximately million for the segment 
the remainder of the growth was attributable to recent direct to consumer advertising  and the introduction of the self cath plus lubricious catheter in fiscal  which positively impacted unit sales 
net sales of intermittent catheters increased  or million to million  and were partially offset by a decrease of  or million in net sales of male external catheters as compared in the prior year 
the decrease in male external catheter sales was primarily attributable to the timing of distributor purchases 
net sales of other disposable healthcare and ostomy products increased to million from million in the prior year primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rate movements and unit sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal was of net sales  compared to in fiscal cost of sales for the aesthetic and general surgery products decreased to from of net sales  primarily due to efficiencies of scale and improved manufacturing efficiencies at our texas facility  partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at our manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
cost of sales for surgical urology products decreased to from of net sales  primarily due to the decrease in brachytherapy sales which have a lower margin than other surgical urology products and the vertical integration of our subsidiary  mills biopharmaceuticals  as the manufacturer of our own iodine brachytherapy seeds 
cost of sales for clinical and consumer healthcare products decreased to from of net sales in the prior year  primarily due to product mix shift towards higher margin products and manufacturing efficiencies in our minnesota facility 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal approximately million of the increase reflects the effect of foreign currency rate movements  primarily the stronger euro 
we had generally higher levels of expenses at our foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries of approximately million and new general and administrative expenses at recently acquired subsidiaries of approximately million 
during fiscal we implemented a global enterprise resource planning erp system 
as a result  certain non capitalizable expenses  training costs  depreciation and start up inefficiencies contributed to higher levels of expenses 
these costs were approximately million 
selling and marketing expenses included approximately million of additional expenses related to the reorganization of the urology sales forces for cross training and costs related to a reduction in the number of employees 
the balance of the increase is generally related to higher levels of selling and marketing efforts 
research and development research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million and to of net sales from in fiscal approximately million of the increase was attributable to the aesthetic and general surgery segment and was primarily due to increased activity in our breast implant studies to support our silicone gel filled breast implant pma  increased patient volume in our adjunct study  and our recent acquisition of a life ltd  which was in the process of developing a hyaluronic acid based soft tissue filler for aesthetic facial applications 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to our ongoing development activities in our surgical urology segment and the development of automated manufacturing technologies  and development expenses related to brachytherapy seeds 
our gel implant pma was filed with the fda in december and we amended our application to meet new draft guidance for saline  silicone gel  and alternative breast implants released by the fda during fiscal interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal interest expense included interest on our foreign lines of credit and imputed interest on long term liabilities recorded at net present value related to certain acquisitions of assets during fiscal and in december  we issued convertible subordinated notes totaling million 
interest expense for fiscal includes four months of accrued interest payable and amortization of bond issue costs 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to the interest on these notes  partially offset by lower rates of interest  lower levels of borrowings on our operating lines and decreased levels of imputed interest on acquisition liabilities

also in fiscal  we sold our remaining investment in nasi and we recorded a pre tax gain of  income taxes our effective rate of corporate income taxes was in fiscal year  an increase of of pretax income from the rate in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate represented a return to our historic effective tax rate  as the prior year s rates reflected refunds received in the third quarter of fiscal year related to the amendment of tax returns for our foreign sales corporation 
net income and earnings per share net income in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal earnings per share was per share in both fiscal and diluted earnings per share was per diluted share  as restated to reflect the additional shares that would be issued upon conversion of our convertible notes  in accordance with the adoption of eitf issue no 
in december  in fiscal and in fiscal the effect of lower net income in fiscal was offset by the positive impact of fewer shares outstanding due to our stock repurchase program 
increased net sales and lower cost of goods sold in fiscal were offset by higher operating expenses  which resulted in a decrease in operating income 
fiscal net income was partially impacted by a slightly higher effective tax rate compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million and million at march  and  respectively 
other than the proceeds of the december offering of convertible subordinated notes  cash provided by operating activities has been our primary recurring source of funds 
we invest excess cash in marketable securities that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and predominantly have maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase 
the company s short term marketable securities consist primarily of money market mutual funds  us state and municipal government and government agency obligations  federal home loan bank and mortgage association bonds  auction rate securities  and investment grade corporate obligations  including commercial paper 
cash flow changes cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal was greater than net income in both and due to the net impact of non cash adjustments to income 
non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization  compensation expense related to the acceleration of stock options  tax benefits from stock options  impairment of long lived assets  imputed interest on long term liabilities  as well as adjustments for gains and losses from the sale of investments 
for fiscal year ended march   there was a positive working capital change resulting from cash provided by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by cash used for accounts receivable and inventory increases 
however  the days sales outstanding metric improved decreasing from days at march   to days at march  cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable debt securities  capital expenditures and cash consideration used in acquisitions 
total cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal we reinvested our cash in marketable debt securities in net amounts of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal as a result of upgrades to our production facilities and equipment  and the completion of our botulinum toxin production facility 
we anticipate doubling our capital expenditures to approximately million in fiscal  as we will continue to invest in facility improvements and production equipment 
during fiscal  we invested approximately million to upgrade production equipment and facilities  complete our iodine brachytherapy seed production capabilities  automate production technologies  and upgrade and replace our information technology systems with a new enterprise resource planning system erp by jd edwards 
in addition  in fiscal  we invested million procuring intangible rights to products and technologies

on october   we acquired inform solutions  inc  for total consideration of million in cash 
the agreement committed us to make additional payments totaling up to million based upon achievement of future sales and earnings thresholds over three years following the acquisition 
approximately million was paid during fiscal and approximately million remains 
cash provided by used in financing activities is primarily related to our stock repurchases  dividends paid  employee stock option exercises  and debt financing activities 
we have a stock repurchase program  primarily to offset the dilutive effect of our employee stock option program  to provide liquidity to the market  and to reduce the overall number of shares outstanding 
all shares repurchased under the program are retired and are no longer deemed to be outstanding 
during the quarter ended december   million shares were repurchased for million 
the december repurchase included the repurchase of million shares from two investment partnerships managed by va partners  llc  which was at the time  our largest shareholder 
mr 
jeff ubben  a managing member of va partners  llc  is a member of our board of directors 
the repurchase of such shares was at or below closing market price quotations on the nyse  and the transactions were pre approved by our audit committee 
at march   million shares remained authorized for repurchase 
the timing of our repurchases is subject to market conditions  cash availability  and blackout periods during which we are restricted from repurchasing shares 
there is no guarantee that shares authorized for repurchase by the board will ultimately be repurchased 
additionally  after the repurchase of the million shares currently authorized for repurchase  our new credit agreement limits the amount that can be used to repurchase shares to net income from the previous four quarters less dividends 
in september  the board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from 
per share to 
per share 
previously  in july  the board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from

proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our common stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
financing senior credit facility on may   we entered into a three year credit agreement credit agreement that provides us with a million senior revolving credit facility  subject to a million sublimit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit  a million sublimit for swing line loans  and a million alternative currency sublimit 
at our election and subject to lender approval  the amount available for borrowings under the credit agreement may be increased by an additional million 
funds are available under the credit agreement to finance permitted acquisitions  stock repurchases up to certain dollar limitations  and for other general corporate purposes 
as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
interest on borrowings other than swing line loans under the credit agreement is at a variable rate that is calculated  at our option  at the prime rate  or libor plus an additional percentage that varies between and  depending on our senior leverage ratio at the time of the borrowing 
swing line loans bear interest at the prime rate plus additional basis points  depending on our senior leverage ratio at the time of the loan 
in addition  we paid certain fees to the lenders to initiate the credit agreement and will pay an unused commitment fee based on our senior leverage ratio and unborrowed lender commitments 
borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by two of our domestic subsidiaries and are also secured by a pledge of of the outstanding capital stock of two of our other domestic subsidiaries and by of the outstanding capital stock of our french subsidiary 
in addition  if the ratio of total funded debt to adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization or adjusted ebitda  exceeds to  then we are obligated to grant to the lenders a first priority perfected security interest in essentially all of our domestic assets 
the credit agreement imposes certain financial and operational restrictions  including financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of not greater than to  a senior funded debt ratio of not greater than to  a minimum quarterly adjusted ebitda  and a minimum fixed charge ratio of greater than to 
the covenants also restrict our ability  among other things  to make certain investments  incur certain types of indebtedness or liens  make acquisitions in excess of million except in compliance with certain criteria  and repurchase shares of common stock  pay dividends or dispose of assets above specified thresholds 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default  including payment defaults  material inaccuracies in our representations and warranties  covenant defaults  bankruptcy and involuntary proceedings  monetary judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts  cross defaults to certain other agreements  change of control  and erisa defaults 
convertible subordinated notes on december   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due january   pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes bear interest at per annum and are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share and are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes  we entered into a convertible bond hedge and warrants transactions with respect to our common stock  the exposure for which is held by credit suisse first boston llc for a net cash payment of million 
both the bond hedge and the warrants transactions may be settled at our option either in cash or net shares and expire january  the convertible bond hedge and warrants transactions combined are intended to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes by effectively increasing the conversion price per share  from our perspective  to approximately other financing in addition  in fiscal  we established several lines of credit with local foreign lenders to facilitate operating cash flow needs at our foreign subsidiaries 
these lines are at market rates of interest  unsecured  are guaranteed by us  and total million  of which million was outstanding  and million was available at march  in fiscal  a line of credit of million was established to finance the construction of a new facility in leiden  the netherlands 
upon completion  the line of credit was converted to a revolving facility 
the borrowings accrue interest at euribor plus and are secured by the new facility and other assets in the netherlands 
at march   million was outstanding and million was available under this line 
at march   our total short term borrowings under all lines of credit were million and the weighted average interest rate was 
the total amount of additional borrowings available to us under all lines of credit was million and million at march  and  respectively 
the decrease in the amounts available from the prior year is primarily due to the expiration of our previous million credit agreement in september contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other commitments at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years convertible notes operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest on debt lines of credit credit agreement commitment fees acquisition and other milestones other long term liabilities total the nature of our business creates a need to enter into purchase obligations with suppliers 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inventory related and other purchase obligations do not exceed our projected requirements over the normal course of business 
we enter into various product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations 
in connection with some of these activities  we agree to make payments to third parties when specific milestones are achieved  such as receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we believe that funds generated from operations  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds available under our line of credit agreements will be adequate to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditure investment requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance unforeseen requirements or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies through the sale of equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow for other reasons 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
if funds are raised by issuing additional equity securities or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  equity or debt securities issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risks involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not use derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents  with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
we also have current marketable securities  consisting primarily of money market mutual funds  us  state and municipal bonds  and commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years and investments in federal home loan bank and federal mortgage association bonds with maturities of two to five years 
given the relative short term nature of these investments  we do not expect to experience any material impact upon our results of operation as a result of changes to interest rates related to these investments 
on december   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due january  pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
our subsidiaries also maintain certain levels of variable rate debt such as operating lines of credit 
the majority of our debt carries a fixed rate percentage and therefore is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition related to the variable rate debt described 
exchange rate risk a portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign markets 
we manufacture our products primarily in the united states and europe and sell them outside the us through a combination of international distributors and wholly owned sales offices 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are transacted in us dollars  euros  british pounds  and canadian dollars 
our foreign sales offices primarily invoice customers in their local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets mentioned 
the principal risk exposure we face results from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates 
we experience transactional exchange rate risk when one of our subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
in the last two fiscal years the effect of exchange rate risk has been favorable upon our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently hedge any of the foreign exchange rate exposures 
a significant and rapid change in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations
