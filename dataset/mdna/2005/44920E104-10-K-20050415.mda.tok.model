critical accounting policies and estimates the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign japan jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes

the company and rex tokyo implemented a management services agreement during the three months ended september   which was effective april  stock based compensation sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
intangible assets capitalized software software license costs were capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software license costs were capitalized based upon an assessment of their recoverability 
this assessment requires considerable judgment by management with respect to various factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross margins  estimated economic lives  and changes in software and hardware technology 
amortization is based on the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product which is two years 
other intangible assets other intangible assets primarily relate to acquired software  trademarks and customer lists acquired in our purchase of fan club and iaccele 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets excluding goodwill used in operations  such as property  equipment and improvements  and intangible assets  when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
we are amortizing the intangible assets and intellectual property for fan club entertainment over sixty months on a straight line basis  which is the life of the marvel enterprises  inc agreement 
we amortized the intangible assets and intellectual property acquired in connection with the acquisition of quikcat over sixty months on a straight line basis  which is the expected life of the technology

nanocat is affiliated with quikcat australia pty ltd  our joint venture partner for the quikcat business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized 
we consider revenue realized when the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we account for certain construction contracts projects on the percentage of completion method and under this method  income is recognized as work on contracts progresses  but estimated losses on contracts in progress are charged to operations immediately 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for whom revenue has not been recognized that generally results from products completed by us prior to year end but not accepted by end users until after year end 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified within our portfolio 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
debt and equity financing of capital transactions beneficial conversion features we have adopted emerging issues task force eitf issues  accounting for convertibles securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and  application of issue no 
to certain convertible securities in accounting for the convertible debt 
eitf recognition of a conversion feature that is in the money at issuance as additional paid in capital  measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature 
the intrinsic value of the feature is the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the stock into which the security is convertible  multiplied by the number of shares 
according to eitf  the issuance proceeds should not be reduced by issuance costs when calculating the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
these beneficial conversion features of debt or equity instruments  depending on the specific facts and circumstances will determine whether such beneficial conversion feature is to be recorded as an expense to be amortized over a period of time  expensed immediately or recorded as a deemed dividend

on october   we received notice from the amex staff that we were not in compliance with section a ii  which requires a company to have shareholders equity of not less than  if the company has sustained losses from continuing operations and or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years 
amex staff also informed us in that letter that we must submit a description of the acquisition and or investment that would bring the company into compliance with all continued listing standards by november  in addition  the amex staff notified us that if we did not have at least  in shareholders equity in our financial report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   that we would also not be in compliance with section a iii of the amex company guide  which requires a company to have  in shareholders equity if the company has sustained losses from continuing operations and or net losses in our five most recent fiscal years 
on november   we announced that pbaa  inter asset japan and mr 
isobe collectively invested an additional  into the company in a private placement 
this increased our stockholder s equity to approximately  on november  on december   we received notice from the amex staff that we have evidenced compliance with the requirements for continued listing on amex 
in addition  the amex staff reminded us that we have become subject to section h of the amex company guide and our financial report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   when it is expected to be filed on approximately march   must evidence compliance with section a iii of the amex company guide  which requires a company to have shareholders equity above  provided the company expects to incur losses from continuing operations and or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years 
we are working to maintain our amex listing  but there can be no guarantee that this listing will be achieved after march  not achieving our plan of compliance accepted by amex and the listing rules set forth in the amex company guide could result in our common stock being delisted from amex  which could materially affect the ability of our stockholders to dispose of their shares and reduce the liquidity of their investment 
in addition  delisting could affect our ability to obtain financing to support future operations and acquisitions 
we may need additional financing to support our operations and acquire businesses we may need to obtain additional financing in order to continue our current operations  including the cash flow needs of fan club  rex tokyo and ia global acquisition co  to acquire businesses and to meet our amex requirements of million in stockholder s equity by march  for continued listing of our shares 
our major shareholders thus far have indicated a willingness to support our financing efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding  or that if such funding is available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us  from our major shareholders or otherwise 
moreover  if we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing  we would incur substantial interest expense 
sales of additional equity securities will dilute on a pro rata basis the percentage ownership of all holders of common stock 
if we do raise more equity capital in the future  it is likely that it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders 
any inability to obtain additional financing may materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is exposed to legal claims we have been  currently are  or in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims 
such current claims are detailed in part  item  legal proceedings 
such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s time and attention 
there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in resolving such claims 
we may engage in acquisitions  mergers  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures that could result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we may engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions  mergers  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as part of our business strategy  we completed one acquisition during early  one acquisition in august one acquisition in march and one acquisition in june  invested in a joint venture in july  and expanded the rex tokyo business as discussed  and sold a business in december   a joint venture in october and a business in february  such transactions are accompanied by a number of risks  including use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities on potentially unfavorable terms  incurrence of debt on potentially unfavorable terms as well as amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and the possibility that we may pay too much cash or issue too much of our stock as the purchase price for an acquisition relative to the economic benefits that we ultimately derive from such acquisition 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time during the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time after closing from focus on operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had been smaller  private companies  the need to sell acquired technology into the marketplace  the need to incorporate acquired technology  content or rights into our products and unanticipated expenses related to such integration  and the need to successfully develop an acquired in process technology to achieve the value currently capitalized as intangible assets 
from time to time  we have also engaged in discussions with candidates regarding the potential acquisitions of our product lines  technologies and businesses 
if divestiture such as this does occur  we cannot be certain that our business  operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to the purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business  and collect the proceeds from the divestitures 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile the market price of our common stock has been and is likely in the future to be highly volatile 
our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in response to factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new product introductions by us or our competitors  competitive activities  announcements by us regarding significant acquisitions  strategic relationships  capital expenditure commitments  liquidity and our amex listing  additions or departures of key personnel  issuance of convertible or equity securities for general or merger and acquisition purposes  issuance of debt or convertible debt for general or merger and acquisition purposes  general market and economic conditions  investor relation activities  defending significant litigation  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
the stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
factors like this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sale of a significant number of our shares could depress the price of our stock 
sales or issuances of a large number of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception that sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
as of march   million shares of common stock were outstanding 
significant shares were held by our principal stockholders and other company insiders 
as affiliates as defined under rule of the securities act rule of the company  our principal stockholders and other company insiders may only sell their shares of common stock in the public market in compliance with rule  including the volume limitations therein 
we have limited insurance we have limited director and officer insurance and commercial insurance policies 
any significant insurance claims would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a limited operating history and revised our business plan we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects  having only commenced our initial business operations in april in addition  we have shifted our revenue model from broadband entertainment channels and revenues derived from advertising to operating primarily as a holding company 
we intend to grow our rex tokyo business 
also  we intend to further increase the number of majority owned companies by acquiring primarily japanese small to midsize companies at low acquisition costs in the media  entertainment and technology areas 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for media  entertainment and technology products and services 
as we have such a limited history of operations  investors will be unable to assess our future operating performance or our future financial results or condition by comparing these criteria against their past or present equivalents 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future we have experienced net losses since inception 
we expect our net losses from operations to decrease  but to continue for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability 
our customer base is concentrated one customer was of net revenues for the year ending december  we anticipate that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of a significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our vendor base is concentrated our vendor base is concentrated in a few major suppliers for rex tokyo and fan club 
we anticipate that significant vendor concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
such concentration can result in pricing  payment or supply issues and such issues would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on certain third party licenses and agreements on june   cyberbred signed a five year agreement with marvel enterprises  inc to manage their fan club in japan 
on july   fan club signed a subcontract agreement with cyberbred to exclusively manage the entire marvel fan club in japan in accordance with the agreement between cyberbred and marvel 
under the july  agreement  cyberbred will make best efforts to transfer the rights under their agreement with marvel  directly to fan club entertainment 
at this time  this transfer has not taken place 
we currently are not a party to the agreement between cyberbred and marvel 
however  this contract is material to us and we would be materially adversely affected by a termination of the relationship between cyberbred and marvel 
we cannot make any assurances about the relationship between cyberbred and marvel 
on july  and august  fan club  signed two license agreements with total insurance management for use in building internet platforms  including content 
the license costs of  were capitalized and are being amortized over the two year life of the agreements 
rex tokyo agreed in approximately to pay monthly  yen or approximately  at current exchange rates to a majority owned company of the ceo of rex tokyo for assigning the distribution rights for certain lock products for tokyo  japan to rex tokyo 
this distribution agreement assignment is ongoing and resulted in sales of approximately  at current exchange rates 
we are subject to competitive pressures while we are not aware of any organization that is providing the complete suite of services under the same business model we are utilizing  in general  we face competition from entities that provide supply equipment and services to the pachinko and gaming industry or which provide advertising  merchandising  publishing  website and data management services 
certain of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing their services and products 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  we may from time to time make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the foregoing  some of our key customers or potential customers might decide to supply equipment or services to the pachinko and gaming industry or provide advertising  merchandising  publishing  website and data management services 
although this has not been the industry trend over the past year  if this were to happen  we might be adversely impacted thereby 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights we regard our copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  patents  and similar intellectual property as significant to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with our employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we are unable to assure investors as to the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights or those of other companies within the industry 
we are also unable to assure investors that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate 
furthermore  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
we are dependent on key personnel we have experienced turnover of management and directors 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management and other personnel  some of whom could be difficult to replace 
we do not maintain key man life insurance covering certain of our officers 
our success will depend on the performance of our officers  our ability to retain and motivate our officers  our ability to integrate new officers into our operations and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team 
our failure to retain and recruit officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our principal stockholders have substantial influence over our company as of april   inter asset japan lbo no 
fund iaj lbo fund  pbaa fund ltd 
pbaa  terra firma fund ltd 
terra firma  inter asset japan co 
ltd 
iaj  alan margerison and hiroki isobe collectively hold approximately of our common stock 
such entities stated in a schedule d that they may be deemed to constitute a group for the purposes of rule d under the exchange act 
mr 
alan margerison  our director  president and chief executive officer  currently serves as the chairman of iaj  and together with his business partner  mr 
hiroki isobe  they control each of our controlling stockholders 
iaj has the ability to cause a change of control of our board of directors by electing candidates of its choice to the board at a stockholder meeting  and approve or disapprove any matter requiring stockholder approval  regardless of how our other stockholders may vote 
further  under delaware law  iaj has significant influence over our affairs  including the power to cause  delay or prevent a change in control or sale of the company  which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks the majority of our operations are located in japan 
we do not trade in hedging instruments or other than trading instruments and a significant change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the japanese yen and us dollar would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in the pachinko industry over the last few years the pachinko slot machine industry in japan has seen significant growth in operators known as chain stores 
rex tokyo has taken advantage of this growth  and focused heavily on servicing these clients 
during  of rex tokyo s revenues resulted from sales to one chain store 
any slow down from this side of the industry could significantly impact rex tokyo s ability to perform at its current levels of revenue 
further  chain stores have thus far focused heavily on a high level of automation within the stores 
any change in plan by chain stores to decrease the level of automation could adversely affect rex tokyo s sales of machinery and parts 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
the pachinko slot machine industry in japan has seen a significant growth in the slot machine side of the business  while the pachinko market has remained more constant in terms of total number of machines in stores 
rex tokyo has focused heavily on the slot machine side of the business 
any downturn in growth of the slot machine market  or any change in the law that might curtail sales of slot machines in the market  could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
rex tokyo has expanded its sales offices based on a perceived need for more local representation in areas where clients are based 
in providing clients with a local office  feedback from clients can be more readily received  thus helping to improve service levels 
there is also a possibility that information from clients may be filtered prior to reaching head office 
this may result in a less accurate picture of client satisfaction levels and expectations 
rex tokyo regularly conducts meetings with managers from the local offices to hear their views in an effort to combat this  however  a decrease in client satisfaction levels could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
rex tokyo has seen an expansion of its business by aligning itself strongly with a number of core clients 
if for any reason rex tokyo s image was damaged with those clients or in the industry as a whole  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
rex tokyo s business is dependent upon its ability to maintain tight control on its cash flow cycle 
in general  as the amount of work increases the amount of cash flow required increases 
if rex tokyo is not able to maintain sufficient cash flow to expand its business at the same pace as it s client s expansion  it may lead to clients moving their accounts to other service providers 
rex tokyo is dependent upon key suppliers for supply of parts and machinery to the pachinko slot machine industry  it also outsources a large amount of its maintenance and installation work 
failure to secure specific machines or parts that clients request from suppliers may lead to a decrease in sales 
failure to maintain good relationships with its suppliers and outsourcing companies could result in the inability to complete work for clients 
revenue recognition is based on completion of work and industry regulated police inspection being carried out so that stores can open 
a change in this system or the delay of inspections could adversely affect revenue 
the passing of legislation that may allow for other forms of gaming within japan could cause a material change in the business model of rex tokyo 
while no legislation has been passed at this time  debate in political circles over the introduction of legal casinos in japan has been public knowledge for some time 
it is not known whether such legislation might ever be passed in japan  or if it was passed  what impact that may have on rex tokyo s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
further  the existence and growth of illegal or underground casinos in japan may also have a similar negative impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency we were exposed to foreign currency risks due to the acquisition of fan club on august  and rex tokyo on march  these businesses operate in japan 
we do not trade in hedging instruments or other than trading instruments and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk due to the loan payable affiliated party of  as of december  on january   rex tokyo refinanced this loan by entering into a  yen  or  at current exchange rates  loan with mizuho bank co ltd  unrelated japanese bank 
on march   rex tokyo received a  yen  or approximately  at current exchange rates  working capital loan from chiba bank ltd  an unrelated japanese bank 
the loan will be used to fund rex tokyo s growth 
the company does not trade in hedging instruments or other than trading instruments and is exposed to interest rate risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition and results of operations
