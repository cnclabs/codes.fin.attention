item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading less than truckload multi regional motor carrier providing timely one to five day service among five regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
through our four branded product groups  od domestic  od expedited  od global and od technology  we offer an expanding array of innovative products and services 
at december   we provided full state coverage to of the states that we serve directly within the southeast  south central  northeast  midwest and west regions of the country 
through marketing and carrier relationships  we also provided service to and from the remaining states as well as international services around the globe 
we plan to continue to expand our markets and increase our direct coverage to states and our full state coverage to states in the first quarter of  as a result of the january acquisition of wskt 
historically  over of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 
we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an inter regional carrier 
we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors and we are highly competitive with our principal regional competition 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth strategies 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges and revenue adjustments are included in this measurement for all periods presented in this annual report 
we changed the calculation of this metric in to include revenue adjustments that are typical in the ltl industry  such as customer allowances and changes to components used in the original rating of the shipment  and we applied this change to the calculation for prior periods reflected in this report 
we believe this change improves the periodic comparison of this pricing measurement 
ltl weight per ltl shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in ltl weight per ltl shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by segmenting our revenue into lengths of haul  we can determine our market share and the growth potential of our service products in those markets 
ltl revenue per ltl shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of ltl shipments we receive  to calculate total ltl revenue 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increased density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  pickup and delivery p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour and platform pounds per hour 
we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 

table of contents the majority of direct costs associated with our business are driver and service center wages and benefits  operating supplies and expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems  while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 
we believe our non union workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition 
advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks  which we believe result in greater productivity  customer service  efficiency and cost savings 
we focus on communication and the continued education  development and motivation of our employees to ensure that our relationships remain excellent 
market fluctuations in the cost of key components of our cost structure  such as diesel fuel  can affect our profitability 
our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
we are also subject to market changes in insurance rates  and we continue to evaluate our balance of excess insurance coverage and self insurance to minimize that cost

table of contents compared to key financial and operating metrics for and are presented below change change revenue in thousands operating ratio net income in thousands basic and diluted earnings per share ltl tonnage in thousands ltl shipments in thousands ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight ltl weight per ltl shipment lbs 
average length of haul miles ltl revenue per ltl shipment in and for the third consecutive year  we achieved double digit growth in revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share 
because our focus in remained primarily on revenue growth in existing markets  we were successful in increasing our operating density and achieved reductions in our operating ratio to from in increased revenue and improved operating efficiency enabled us to achieve a increase in net income and a increase in earnings per share  both in excess of our growth in revenue 
our earnings per share improvement was achieved despite the dilutive effects of our third quarter stock offering  which increased our shares outstanding by  shares  or 
our revenue growth in was driven primarily by two factors  a growth in ltl tonnage coupled with a increase in ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 
we believe our tonnage gains are due to overall improvements in the us domestic economy and our ability to attract new customers 
in  ltl weight per ltl shipment increased over we believe the increase in ltl weight per ltl shipment indicates greater demand for our customers products and a resulting increase in overall shipment size and weight 
in addition  we have seen higher year over year growth rates in our customer base that is priced through individual contracts 
revenue based on contractual pricing increased to of our total revenue in compared with in we believe the expansion of our service center network and full state coverage to of those states at year end has positioned us to be attractive to larger customers that ship to and from many regions in the country and seek to reduce their number of core carriers 
our contract customers generally offer larger shipments  which increase our average ltl weight per ltl shipment 
these customers often have a greater length of haul  which is consistent with our average length of haul increase to miles in from miles in ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased to from 
our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of average higher fuel prices in  the fuel surcharge increased to of revenue from in excluding the fuel surcharge  ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased to from in  reflecting our ability to marginally improve overall pricing in during the year  we opened new service centers 
in addition to these openings  we improved our direct service capabilities in canada and initiated sales operations in toronto and montreal 
while the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth  these events did not have a significant impact on our annual results 
density  as measured by increases in tonnage and concentrations of shipments moving through our route structure and service center network  generated efficiencies throughout our operations 
as a result  we achieved reductions in salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue  which decreased to in from in driver wages decreased to of revenue in from for the prior year 
we achieved a improvement in p d shipments handled per hour and a increase in our laden load average for the year 
we also experienced a similar reduction in platform labor  which decreased to of revenue in from for the prior year 
our fringe benefit costs increased slightly to of payroll in from for the prior year due primarily to increases in holiday  vacation and other paid time off 

table of contents operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to a increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  resulting from increased fuel prices and an increase in consumption 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments  therefore  we are subject to market price fluctuations 
our fuel surcharges  which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach established base levels  effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in insurance and claims expense  primarily consisting of premiums and self insured costs for auto liability and cargo claims  increased to of revenue in compared to in we choose to self insure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels 
while cargo claims liabilities in remained relatively constant with experience  our auto liability claims experience under our retention level increased to of revenue for compared to in the prior year 
this increase is due to both the number and severity of claims that were incurred during and to increases in reserves for claims incurred in prior years 
the focus on revenue growth in existing markets has provided opportunities to leverage our investments in property and equipment 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to of revenue in from in in addition  building and office equipment rents decreased to of revenue in from in the prior year 
as a result of greater service center utilization and improved density  our average revenue per service center increased over the prior year 
we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and pickup and delivery services 
we also contract with lease operators and lease tractors  trailers and other revenue producing equipment 
we utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial 
purchased transportation increased to of revenue in from in  primarily as a result of the increased use of purchased linehaul services  which increased to of revenue in from of revenue in we increased our utilization of these linehaul services in primarily to offset freight imbalances in our longer haul lanes 
our revenue growth and density improvements in allowed us to successfully leverage our communication and utilities costs along with general supplies and expenses  which decreased to of revenue in from in we applied the proceeds of  from our third quarter stock offering to reduce outstanding debt on our credit facility 
at year end  long term debt including current maturities was  compared to  at december   a decrease of  or 
as a result  interest expense for  net of interest income  decreased to  from  in we also capitalized  more interest during than the prior year  which also contributed to the decrease in net interest expense 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in compared to we produced a increase in revenue in coupled with a increase in net income for the year 
revenue increased to  from  in  our second consecutive year of double digit revenue growth and the eleventh in the thirteen years since our initial public offering in our operating ratio decreased to from and net income for was  compared to  in most of our growth in can be attributed to market share gains in existing areas of our operations  which increased our density and resulted in lower incremental operating costs 
revenue per service center increased  despite opening additional service centers in these openings accounted for less than of our increase in revenue in  but enabled us to offer full state coverage to all points in arkansas  louisiana and missouri and increase our full state coverage from to of the states in which we provide direct service 

table of contents our ltl shipments increased over and ltl tonnage increased  both indicators of increased market share and an improving domestic economy 
we also continued to benefit from the september   bankruptcy of consolidated freightways  a major national ltl carrier and one of our competitors 
our average length of haul increased to miles from in  which is consistent with the longer haul freight that became available after the closure of consolidated freightways 
ltl revenue per ltl shipment increased to from in  an increase of 
this was due to a combination of a increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight  partially offset by a decrease in weight per shipment 
approximately of our revenue was generated from public tariffs  which are generally reviewed on an annual basis with the most recent general price increase occurring on july  the remaining revenue base was generated from contractual agreements  typically one to two years in length  which are renegotiated as they near expiration 
while the average ltl weight per ltl shipment was lower in  we have seen consecutive monthly increases in this measurement since april and we believe this is yet another indicator of an improving economic climate as our customers are moving larger shipments through our network 
our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of average higher fuel prices in  the fuel surcharge increased to of revenue from in the market share increases we experienced in generated operating efficiencies and productivity gains throughout our operations  which is reflected in a decrease in our operating ratio to from in the benefit of increased freight density was particularly evident in the reduction in salaries  wages and benefits  which decreased to of revenue in from in p d wages decreased to of revenue from in a portion of these savings resulted from the rollout of our driver hand held computers  which was completed by year end these handheld computers provide direct communication between our drivers  service center personnel and other old dominion systems  which results in more efficient routings of our p d fleet and increased productivity 
for the comparable years  p d shipments handled per hour increased and p d wages per shipment decreased slightly  despite an average hourly wage increase of approximately 
platform wages decreased to of revenue in from in this reduction was due to increased dock productivity partially due to the implementation of our dock yard management system at most of our major facilities by year end this system utilizes barcode technology to improve freight visibility throughout our systems and allow for faster and more efficient handling of freight 
ltl weight per platform hour and ltl shipments per platform hour  both measures of dock productivity  increased and  respectively  in while platform wages per ltl hundredweight increased only against an average hourly wage increase of reductions in p d and platform wages were partially offset by an increase in linehaul wages to of revenue from in linehaul miles increased  due to increased business levels and a longer average length of haul  and average linehaul wages per mile increased 
slight improvements in our linehaul load factor  the weight of shipments loaded onto trailers for each linehaul dispatch  was not sufficient to offset these additional costs 
our fringe benefit costs increased to of payroll in from for the prior year due primarily to increases in workers compensation expenses 
we self insure workers compensation claims in a range between  and  depending upon the plan year and the state in which we are operating 
we also carry excess coverage for claims in excess of these deductibles 
in  the combination of claims expense and insurance premiums was of payroll compared to in  primarily due to anticipated settlement costs for our self insured portion 
diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  increased over due to a increase in consumption and increased costs per gallon 
we did not use diesel fuel hedging instruments in or  therefore  we were subject to market price fluctuations 
we believe that our fuel surcharges  which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach base levels  effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in 
table of contents net capital expenditures in were  which included  for purchases of tractors and trailers in addition to  for purchases of service center facilities or capital improvements to existing service center facilities 
these capital expenditures included the purchase of eleven service center facilities auctioned as a result of the september bankruptcy of consolidated freightways 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to of revenue from in as these properties replaced leased facilities  our building and office equipment rents decreased to of revenue from for the prior year 
insurance and claims expense  primarily consisting of premiums and self insured costs for auto liability and cargo claims  decreased to of revenue in compared to in premiums for excess coverage above our self insured retention levels generally increased over the prior year as a percentage of revenue 
these additional costs were offset by favorable claims experience in our self insured retention for both auto liability and cargo claims  resulting in a decline in our overall insurance costs in our revenue growth and density improvements in allowed us to successfully leverage other costs  including communication and utilities  general supplies and expenses  and miscellaneous expenses  which as a group declined to of revenue from in expenses for uncollectible revenue  a component of miscellaneous expenses  decreased to of revenue from in interest expense for  net of interest income  increased to  from  in by year end  we borrowed  on our line of credit and an additional  on other debt instruments  however  we made principal payments of  on outstanding debt during the year  resulting in net borrowings of  for since average outstanding debt remained relatively constant for the comparable years  the increase in interest expense can be attributed to the decrease in the amount of interest that was capitalized in  which was  compared to  in our effective tax rate for was compared to in liquidity and capital resources expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
in order to support these requirements  we incurred net capital expenditures of  during cash and cash flows generated internally funded approximately of these expenditures 
at december   long term debt including current maturities decreased to  from  at december   primarily due to the application of the proceeds from our third quarter stock offering to outstanding debt on our credit facility 
we estimate net capital expenditures  including the wskt selected asset purchase  to be approximately  to  for the year ending december  of that  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers   is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities   is allocated for investments in technology  and the balance is allocated for other assets 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by additional borrowings 

table of contents the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for the years ended december    and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other proceeds from sale total we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement dated june  with lenders consisting of wachovia bank  national association  bank of america  na  and branch banking and trust company  with wachovia as agent for the lenders 
this three year facility  as amended  consists of  in line of credit commitments from the lenders  all of which are available for revolving loans 
in addition  of that  line of credit   may be used for letters of credit and  may be used for borrowings under wachovia s sweep program 
the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of  or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances 
revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a an applicable margin plus the higher of wachovia s prime rate or one half of one percentage point over the federal funds rate the adjusted base rate  or b libor plus an applicable margin the adjusted libor rate 
the applicable margin varies depending upon our ratio of adjusted debt to capital 
in the case of the adjusted base rate  the applicable margin ranges from to 
in the case of the adjusted libor rate  the applicable margin ranges from to 
the applicable margin under this agreement for for the adjusted base rate and the adjusted libor rate was and  respectively 
revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the aggregate rate applicable under the sweep program plus the adjusted libor rate 
quarterly fees ranging from to are charged on the aggregate unused portion of the facility determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital 
the applicable rate for the periods under this agreement in was 
quarterly fees are charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit at a rate ranging from to  which was in as determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital 
in addition  a quarterly facing fee at an annual rate of was charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit 
the june credit facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of adjusted debt to capital  to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
our wholly owned subsidiary guaranteed payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
future wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
at december   there was  outstanding on the line of credit facility and there was  outstanding on the standby letter of credit facility 
we had three senior note agreements outstanding totaling  at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from to  of which  is due in interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from to 
our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios 
at december   our credit agreement was the most restrictive and limited the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the difference between our current tangible net worth  which is defined as shareholders equity plus intangible assets  and the sum of  and of cumulative net income since march  we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in we have a term loan with principal outstanding of  as of december   which was used to purchase tractors 
the term loan consists of month term notes secured by the purchased 
table of contents equipment pursuant to a security agreement with the lender 
the notes call for equal monthly payments of principal and interest and mature in  of which  in principal is due within the next months 
the interest rates on the notes are fixed and range from to 
the term loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the term notes originally incorporated by reference the financial covenants from our may credit facility and were amended to incorporate by reference our financial covenants under our june facility 
with the exception of the line of credit  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of  at december  we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
also  we do not use fuel hedging instruments  as our tariff provisions and contracts generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance  and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and long term capital needs 
on february   we entered into a note purchase agreement with allstate life insurance company  allstate life insurance company of new york  new york life insurance company  new york life insurance and annuity corporation  united of omaha life insurance company  pru co

other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses revenue and expense recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
expenses are recognized when incurred 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated unpaid cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health not covered by insurance 
these costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability and group health  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
we are currently self insured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to  per occurrence 
cargo loss and damage claims are self insured up to  we are self insured for workers compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the remaining 
table of contents states with self insured retention levels ranging from  to  group health claims are self insured up to  per occurrence and long term disability claims are self insured to a maximum per individual of  per month 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance of self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
goodwill the excess cost over net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions  or goodwill  is recorded in other assets 
we completed the annual analysis of our intangible assets  required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on our annual measurement date of october   and determined that there was no impairment of intangible assets 
at december   goodwill totaled  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment to include changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base 
for the past three years  the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal

since  we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors  trailers  equipment  parts  tires and fuel 
we believe that  by combining our requirements  we are often able to obtain pricing discounts because of the increased level of purchasing 
while this arrangement is beneficial to us  our management believes that the termination of this relationship would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
for the years ended december   and  we charged leasing   and  respectively  for vehicle repair  maintenance and other services  which we provide to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup
