item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary quaker chemical corporation is a worldwide developer  producer  and marketer of chemical specialty products and a provider of chemical management services for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications around the globe  with significant sales to the steel and automotive industries 
the company s strategies and initiatives flow from three business imperatives sell customer solutions value not just fluids  operate as a globally integrated whole  and harness the power of our global knowledge and learning 
success factors critical to the company s business include successfully differentiating the company s offering from its competition  operating efficiently and profitably as a globally integrated whole  and increasing market share and customer penetration through internally developed business programs and strategic acquisitions 
the results for reflect the challenging business environment in which the company operates 
the company experienced significant revenue growth of in versus  driven by base business growth  the full year impact of the company s acquisitions  and favorable foreign exchange 
approximately half of the company s base business growth was due to the full year effect of the company s chemical management services cms contracts  which were effective may of  as well as additional contracts awarded in the remaining base business increase in revenue was attributable to growth in the asia pacific  north and south american regions  partially offset by lower sales in europe 
even with this revenue increase  earnings were down versus due to significantly higher raw material and selling  general and administrative costs 
since the second half of  the company has experienced a continual escalation in the pricing of its key raw materials  particularly those derived from crude oil 
although the company announced and implemented price increases during the third and fourth quarters of  the benefit of these increases did not mitigate fully the impact of these higher raw material costs in the company s us cms program contributed to profitability in as a result of numerous product conversions completed during the latter half of increases in selling  general and administrative costs were associated with strategic initiatives  as well as a range of administrative costs such as sarbanes oxley compliance  pension  incentive compensation  and higher sales commissions 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began efforts to realign the organization and reduce costs by announcing the consolidation of its administrative facilities in hong kong with its shanghai headquarters

the company expects earnings to improve after a disappointing the company s plans call for high single digit revenue growth and margin improvements assuming raw material costs stabilize 
the company remains committed to its strategic imperatives and will stay focused on managing its raw materials and other costs and its pricing 
also  with its strong financial position and cash flow generation  the company will continue to pursue acquisitions and it expects to continue its record of annual dividend increases 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  accrued incentive compensation 
table of contents plans  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years 
through  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realization of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally established at of the amount owed at the filing date  dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 

table of contents quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and comprised of three investments totaling  and million  respectively 
during  these equity investments reported net profits and were not considered impaired 
tax exposures and valuation allowances quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker establishes reserves for potential tax audit and other exposures as transactions occur and reviews these reserves on a regular basis  however  actual exposures and audit adjustments may vary from these estimates 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital and expansion needs 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
in  quaker recorded restructuring and other exit costs  including involuntary termination of certain employees  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
certain of these items  particularly those involving impairment charges for assets to be sold or closed  require significant estimates and assumptions in terms of estimated sale proceeds  date of sale  transaction costs and other matters  and these estimates can change based on market conditions and other factors 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for exit costs is recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
in february  the company completed the sale of a portion of its villeneuve  france site 
the company incurred no loss on this portion of the sale and expects to complete the sale of the remaining property in the company ceased manufacturing operations at this facility effective march  production was consolidated into its facilities in uithoorn  the netherlands and santa perpetua de mogoda  spain 
sales and laboratory activities will continue at the villeneuve site pending its complete sale 
if the company s estimated selling price at december  changed by  the impact to the company s pre tax earnings would be approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not 
table of contents have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized over a straight line basis based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are no longer amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to its carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required 
for  the company incurred such a non cash charge to equity of million 
the company s pension plan year end is november  which serves as the measurement date

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance under fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the act was enacted on october  the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate income earned abroad principally for earnings that have previously been deemed permanently reinvested by providing a dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
because of limitations contained within the provision  it is not expected that the company will avail itself of this provision 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the 
table of contents american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance on applying the deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities 
the deduction will be phased in from through the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s tax return 
the company does not expect the phase in of this new deduction to result in a material change in its effective tax rate in future periods  based on current earnings levels 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments  sfas r revised  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other similar awards  effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  when measuring the fair value of these awards  companies can choose two different pricing models that appropriately reflect their specific circumstances and the economics of their transactions 
in addition  the company is in the process of selecting one of three transition methods available under sfas r 
accordingly  the company has not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for exchanges on non monetary assets  sfas  exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas requires that exchanges of non monetary assets be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged for annual periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs 
the statement requires that such costs be recognized as a current period expense 
sfas also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after july  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily from million cash provided by operating activities and million provided by financing activities  offset in part by million used in investing activities 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the company s lower net income was primarily responsible for the decrease compared to the prior year  however there were some significant swings in the company s working capital accounts 
accounts receivable in has had less of an impact on operating cash flow  reflecting the initial working capital investment associated with the company s new cms contracts  which began in the second quarter of in addition  in  the company entered into additional cms contracts  which have impacted our working capital accounts 
the increase in inventory is attributable to higher business levels  particularly in the south american and asia pacific markets  the additional cms contracts in the us  and higher raw material costs 
the change in estimated taxes on income is reflective of a million tax settlement received in versus a million overpaid tax position in relating to our european operations 
approximately million of this overpaid tax position was received in january of net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in  the company made no acquisitions versus million paid in for the company s acquisitions of vulcan  eural and ks chemie 
capital expenditures were million less in compared to reflective of higher spending in for the company s us lab renovation and the company s global erp implementation 
dividends and distributions from associated companies decreased million from in  the company had received a million priority distribution from its real estate joint venture 
the increase in proceeds from disposition of assets is primarily due to the sale of real estate by the company s majority owned australian subsidiary 

table of contents in january  the company contributed its conshohocken  pennsylvania property and buildings the site into a real estate joint venture the venture in exchange for a interest in the venture 
the venture did not assume any debt or other obligations of the company and the company did not guarantee nor was it obligated to pay any principle  interest or penalties on any of the venture s indebtedness 
the venture renovated certain of the existing buildings at the site  as well as built new office space the project 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the venture to lease approximately of the site s available office space for a year period commencing february  with multiple renewal options 
the company believes the terms of this lease are no less favorable than the terms it would have obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
in february  the venture sold its real estate assets  which resulted in million of proceeds to the company after payment of the partnership obligations 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in versus million in the change in cash flows was primarily the result of higher debt incurred to fund the company s acquisitions in the company maintains various credit facilities with multiple banks 
at december   the company had credit facilities totaling million  of which million was committed and million was uncommitted 
throughout  the company took action in both the us and europe to increase its credit facilities to million at december   of which million was committed and million was uncommitted 
the provisions of the agreements require that the company maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  and under its most restrictive covenants the company can borrow an additional million 
the company believes that it is capable of renewing its current credit facilities  on an annual basis  or obtaining alternative borrowing capacity on competitive terms 
although the terms of the agreements vary  the interest rates applied to borrowings are generally based  at the company s option  on either a prime rate  libor rate  or euro dollar rate  plus or minus a margin 
at december  and  the company had approximately million and million outstanding on these credit lines at a weighted average borrowing rate of and  respectively 
the company believes that  in  it is capable of supporting its operating requirements including pension plan contributions  payments of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisition opportunities  and possible resolution of contingencies  through internally generated funds supplemented with debt as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions other long term liabilities primarily deferred compensation agreements total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents operations comparison of with consolidated net sales increased by to million in from million in the impact from foreign exchange rate translation increased sales by approximately million  or 
the timing of the company s acquisitions increased net sales by million  or  and the company s new chemical management services cms contracts  increased net sales by million  or 
the remaining increase in net sales was attributable to growth in the asia pacific and north and south american regions partially offset by lower sales in europe 
the decline in business in europe was substantially caused by softness in sheet steel demand 
although the company s market share in this region remained stable during  the increased competitive pressures experienced in late also affected the yearly comparisons 
during  the company began a new approach to its chemical management services cms business in order to further the company s strategic imperative to sell customer solutions value not just fluids 
under the company s traditional cms approach  the company effectively acts as an agent whereby it purchases chemicals from other companies and resells the product to the customer at little or no margin and earns a set management fee for providing this service 
therefore  the profit earned on the management fee is relatively secure as the entire cost of the products is passed on to the customer 
the new approach to cms is dramatically different 
the company receives a set management fee and the costs that relate to those management fees are largely connected to how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
with this new approach come new risks and opportunities  as the profit earned from the management fee is subject to movements in product costs as well as the company s own performance 
the company believes this new approach is a way for quaker to become an integral part of our customers operational efforts to improve manufacturing costs and to demonstrate value that the company would not be able to demonstrate as purely a product provider 
with this new approach  the company was awarded a series of multi year cms contracts at general motors powertrain and daimlerchrysler manufacturing sites in and this business was an important step in building the company s share and leadership position in the automotive process fluids market and should position the company well for penetration of cms opportunities in other metalworking manufacturing sites 
this new approach has also had a dramatic impact on the company s revenue and margins 
under the traditional cms approach  where the company effectively acts as an agent  the revenue and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
as discussed above  the structure of the new cms approach is different in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
as a result  the company recognizes in reported revenues the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold  the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions 
there are two critical success factors for this new approach 
first  is to create savings for a customer based on our ability to help apply the product better and improve the customer s own processes 
second  is to convert more of the product being used to quaker product rather than a competitor s product 
while the company s us cms program contributed to profitability in as a result of numerous product conversions completed during the latter half of  overall performance was tempered by higher third party product costs and higher consumption levels 
gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined from in to in the new cms contracts resulted in an increase in the company s reported revenue of approximately million and a corresponding decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales of approximately percentage points 
the remaining decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to increased raw material costs  as well as unfavorable product and geographic mix 
even though the company experienced a four year high in the pricing of its key raw material markets at the end of  the pricing of these key raw materials continued to escalate in while the company benefited from the implementation of price increases announced during the third and fourth quarters of  these gains were more than offset by the continued increase in raw material prices  particularly crude oil based derivatives 

table of contents selling  general and administrative costs sg a as reported for were million compared to million in approximately of the million increase was due to foreign exchange rate translation and the company s acquisition activity  which impacted sg a by approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of the remaining increase was due to costs associated with strategic initiatives  as well as a range of administrative costs such as sarbanes oxley compliance  pension  incentive compensation  and higher sales commissions 
the company s strategic initiatives include expanding our presence in the asia pacific region  further supporting our cms business  the continued rollout of our global erp system  and continuing development of new  complementary businesses 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began efforts to realign the organization and reduce costs by announcing the consolidation of its administrative facilities in hong kong with its shanghai headquarters  resulting in a million pre tax charge for restructuring and related activities 
the company continued these efforts in the first quarter of with the elimination of additional positions in the us and europe 
an annualized saving of million to million is expected from these actions 
these savings will be reinvested in the company s strategic initiatives 
the increase in other income in reflects a gain on the sale of real estate by the company s majority owned australian subsidiary  as well as higher priority return distributions from the company s real estate joint venture in conshohocken 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to higher debt balances outstanding during as well as higher short term interest rates on the company s credit facilities 
the company s effective tax rate was in and in the effective tax rate is dependent on many internal and external factors and is assessed by the company on a regular basis 
in august  a us federal tax audit began in accordance with the company s normal three year cycle 
as of december   this audit was still ongoing 
currently  the company anticipates its effective tax rate for will remain in the to range 
the million increase in minority interest expense in is primarily due to the gain on the sale of real estate relating to the company s australian operations mentioned above as well as a stronger performance from the company s brazilian joint venture

the remaining increase in net sales was due primarily to double digit growth in the asia pacific and south american regions partially offset by a decline in business in the us and europe 
the decline in business in the us and europe was substantially caused by softness in sheet steel demand 
in addition  in late  the company experienced some increased competition as a result of the company s strong market share coupled with its customers interest in establishing second source suppliers

any or all of the forward looking statements in this report  in quaker s annual report to shareholders for and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
this can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed in this report will be important in determining our future performance

we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in quaker s subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a major risk is that the company s demand is largely derived from the demand for its customers products  which subjects the company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns 
other major risks and 
table of contents uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september  furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers 
these risks  uncertainties  and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those discussed below could also adversely affect us 
therefore  we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s long term debt has a fixed interest rate  while its short term debt is negotiated at market rates which can be either fixed or variable 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of short term debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s short term borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in short term borrowings at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
through  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
