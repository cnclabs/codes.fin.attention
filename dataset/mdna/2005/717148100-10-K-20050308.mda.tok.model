item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  
table of contents those contained in the discussion on forward looking statements and those contained in risk factors that follows this section 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
overview we have grown significantly through organic growth and acquisitions 
in  we made two material acquisitions  including our december nd acquisition of pharmanet  which is a leading late stage provider of drug development services 
beginning in  the results of operations of pharmanet will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
we financed the acquisition of pharmanet through two significant debt financings that closed in and are described in more detail below 
accordingly  as discussed below under results of operations  our interest expense is expected to be significantly higher than in prior periods 
the table below reflects the length of time each of our principal operating subsidiaries operated during each year for which we present audited financial statements in this report 
number of months each principal operating subsidiary is included in operating results sfbc miami sfbc ft 
myers sfbc analytical anapharm sfbc charlotte sfbc new drug services clinical pharmacology sfbc new drug services canada sfbc taylor technology pharmanet we merged sfbc charlotte into sfbc new drug services in april included in sfbc miami 
sfbc new drug services canada was a subsidiary of the company from march  through june and its results were reported during that time using the equity method 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet on december   pharmanet s net revenue and operating expenses excluding amortization of intangibles during the nine day period had a net neutral effect on net earnings and were not included in our financial results for highlights for include our revenue increased to approximately million from approximately million  our earnings increased to approximately million from approximately million  our earnings per share increased to from per share  we issued million of convertible senior notes in august  we entered into a million secured credit facility in december consisting of a million term loan  which was fully funded at december  and a million revolving line of credit of which we had drawn million at december  we acquired pharmanet  inc in december  we acquired taylor technology  inc in july  and 
table of contents we purchased the building which contains our executive offices  our principal miami phase i and ii facility and our clinical laboratory in february 
our revenue consists primarily of fees earned for services performed under contracts with branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug company clients 
typically  a portion of our contract fee is due upon signing of the contract  and the majority of the contract fee is generally paid in installments upon the achievement of certain agreed upon performance milestones 
because pharmanet s contracts are generally larger and longer in duration  it typically receives larger advance payments 
our contracts are generally terminable immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts usually require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  fees earned to date  and in some cases a termination fee 
historically  since most of our contracts have been phase i and early stage phase ii trials which are of short duration  we have not experienced any significant terminations of contracts in progress 
pharmanet  whose trials are primarily late stage phase ii  phase iii  and phase iv  typically performs services under long term fixed price contracts which are subject to a greater risk of delay or cancellation 
in our long term phase iii contracts we have historically reported net revenue  which amounts did not include any reimbursed out of pocket expenses consisting of travel and other expenses 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  beginning in we will report revenue line items consisting of net revenue and reimbursed out of pockets  together with an expense line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses which will consist of travel and other expenses for which we are reimbursed by our clients 
through we have recorded our recurring operating expenses in two primary categories  direct costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
as described separately above  in we will record our recurring operating expenses in three primary categories by adding reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs consist primarily of participant fees and associated expenses  direct labor and employee benefits  facility costs  depreciation associated with facilities and equipment used in conducting trials  and other costs and materials directly related to contracts 
direct costs as a percentage of net revenue vary from period to period  due to the varying mix of contracts and services performed and to the percentage of revenue arising from our canadian operations  which generally have higher direct costs 
selling  general and administrative costs consist primarily of administrative payroll and overhead  advertising and public relations expense  legal and accounting expense  travel  depreciation and amortization related to amortizable intangibles 
the gross profit margins on our contracts vary depending upon the nature of the services we perform for our client 
gross profit margins for our phase i and phase ii clinical trials and bioanalytical services generally tend to be higher than those for our phase iii trials management and other services that we perform 
within our phase i and phase ii business  our gross profit margins are generally higher for trials which involve a larger number of participants  a longer period of study time and or the performance of more tests 
gross profit margins for our services to branded drug clients generally tend to be higher than those for generic drug clients 
in addition  our gross profit margins will vary based upon our mix of domestic and international business 
gross profit margins are calculated by dividing the gross margin by net revenue 
our effective tax rate was in  in and in our tax rate increased in as our united states operations contributed a higher proportion of our net earnings and because anapharm s net income exceeded its ability to use available tax credits 
because pharmanet  which conducts operations in countries  has a higher effective tax rate  we believe that our tax rate will increase in our future effective tax rate will be dependent on the amount of the tax credits we receive in connection with our canadian operations and the relative contribution of our domestic and foreign operations to our consolidated pre tax income 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and 
table of contents expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and the company s actual results are subject to the risk factors contained at the end of this section 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue and cost recognition 
revenue from contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
through  due to the predominately early stage nature of our clinical trials  revenue has generally been earned under contracts of short term duration 
our early stage contracts generally contain a budget on a per subject basis or sample tested basis 
however  as the work progresses  our clients frequently modify the scope of our contracts which results in changes to the budget 
our later stage contracts  including many of pharmanet s contracts  generally average approximately months in duration but they can extend up to seven years 
with these long term  fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed on a percentage of completion basis 
generally  with phase iii long term contracts  a portion of the contract fee is paid prior to the time the trial is initiated 
we recognize revenue from these advances only when services are actually performed 
additional payments may also be made based upon the achievement of milestones over the contract duration 
in the event a contract is terminated  most of our contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down the study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to us of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by us under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenue when realization is assured 
contracts may contain provisions for renegotiation in the event of cost overruns due to changes in the level of work scope 
renegotiated amounts are included in revenue when earned and realization is assured 
provisions for losses to be incurred on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which it is determined that a loss will result from performance of the contractual arrangement 
direct costs include all direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as they are incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is possible that the estimates used will change in the near term and that the change could be material 
the uncertainties which can affect our estimates include changes in scope of contracts and unforeseen costs which cannot be billed to the client such as increased costs associated with recruiting special populations for studies 
in the past  our estimates of these uncertainties have not materially affected our revenue or cost recognition  and we do not anticipate making material changes to our method of estimating costs in the future 
as described in the overview above  included in revenue and direct costs are pass through costs for which we are reimbursed by our clients 
because these amounts will become material due to our acquisition of pharmanet  in the future we will comply with eitf and provide a separate line item for reimbursed out of pockets under revenue and a separate line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses under direct costs 
included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts  which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for contract changes is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of our clients  analysis of subsequent changes in contracts  analysis of delinquent accounts  the payment histories of the accounts and management s judgment with respect to current economic conditions 
management believes the allowances are sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management reviews our accounts receivable aging on a regular basis for past due accounts 
any uncollectible amounts are written off against the allowance 
management maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historic collectibility and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major client default on its 
table of contents obligations to us  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
the allowance for changes in contracts is an estimate established through reductions to revenue while the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate established through charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have not made any material adjustments as a result of non payment of accounts receivable 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of our valuation allowance  if necessary 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  we now conduct operations in countries 
we are subject to audit in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
due to the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
as a result of the acquisition of pharmanet  our balance sheet reflects certain valuation allowances related to our ability to realize foreign tax loss carryforwards as of december  if the estimates utilized in connection with establishing the valuation allowance prove inaccurate  resulting increases or decreases in the valuation allowance could be required in the future 
any future changes in valuation allowance can have a material impact on our net earnings 
based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we have determined that a valuation allowance of  was required for specific foreign entities 
pharmanet is  and in the future may be  a party to foreign tax proceedings 
we have established an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for potential adverse outcomes in these pending tax proceedings which would have an impact on the amount of goodwill reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  any future foreign tax proceedings would have an impact on our results of operations if our estimates prove to be inadequate 
it is possible that changes in our estimates in the future could cause us to either materially increase or decrease the amount of our income tax reserve 
with regard to earnings from foreign operations  our policy is to generally retain such earnings in the country in which they were generated 
this permits us to reduce the material united states income tax liabilities which would generally arise upon repatriation of these earnings 
however  in order to provide certain flexibility  we have structured our canadian and spanish operations to permit us to pay significant sums without united states income tax liability 
pharmanet has not taken any similar action to date 
under the terms of our million credit facility  we are required to pay on an annual basis an amount equal to one half of our excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  for that fiscal year to reduce the principal balance of our term loan 
we expect that we will be able use our earnings from our north american operations which includes anapharm to make this required payment and therefore avoid any adverse united states income tax liabilities arising from the earnings from foreign subsidiaries 
goodwill 
on an annual basis  management assesses the composition of our assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
we will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
the test performed for and for prior years did not identify any instances of impairment 
impairment of assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
to date  we have not recognized an impairment loss 
in the 
table of contents future  we will recognize an impairment if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
stock based compensation 
we have granted stock options to our employees at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounted for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the statement of operations 
because we recognized that apb was in the process of being rescinded  in we amended our stock option plan to provide for the granting of restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation in addition to stock options 
in december  apb was superseded by financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which will be effective for all accounting periods beginning after june  we will adopt statement r on july   and will be required to recognize an expense for the fair value of our outstanding stock options 
under statement r  we must determine the transition method to be used at the date of adoption  the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments and the amortization method for compensation cost 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective option requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of statement r  while the retroactive option would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
both transition methods would require management to make accounting estimates 
we have not yet concluded which method we will utilize  nor have we determined what the impact will be on our earnings per share 
other estimates 
we make a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to volume rebates  litigation  etc 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of net revenue for and in thousands  except per share data net revenue direct costs sg a interest expense income earnings before taxes and minority interest minority interest in joint venture income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted the earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the may three for two stock split as a stock dividend 

table of contents net revenue our net revenue was approximately million for the year ended december   which is an increase of approximately from approximately million for the prior year 
our increase stems from both internal growth and our acquisitions 
the primary components of this increase are an increase in anapharm s consolidated revenue from million to approximately million  a significant increase in our united states phase i and phase ii revenue  a full year of operations from clinical pharmacology  our acquisition of taylor technology  inc  and a full year of operations from sfbc anapharm europe 
our revenue increased primarily as the result of performing or managing more clinical trials and testing more samples  increases in the size of clinical trials and price increases 
our early stage clinical trial business benefited both from strong internal growth and from a full year of operations from clinical pharmacology  which has now been fully integrated into our miami phase i clinical trials business 
another important contributor of our growth and net revenue was the increased size and effectiveness of our business development group or sales force 
we have seen an increasing number of new clients in our phase i clinical trials business in the united states and canada 
finally  the improvement in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar contributed to our increased revenue  although as discussed below  the strengthening of the canadian dollar had a negative impact on our results of operations in direct costs direct costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
consistent with the growth in our revenue in  our direct costs increased but to a lesser amount on a percentage basis 
the principal factors were increased personnel expenses  recruiting expenses  subject related payments and expenses  and reimbursable out of pocket expenses related to our phase iii iv business as sfbc new drug services  inc going forward  we expect our direct costs to be higher as a percentage of our net revenue as a result of the increased size of our phase iii iv business due to our acquisition of pharmanet  as this business has higher direct costs 
however  this percentage will vary due to the mix of contracts within our early stage and late stage business 
gross profit margins our gross profit margin was in compared to in our gross margins increased in due to decreased direct costs as a percentage of revenue 
in  we were able to generate increased revenue at substantially all of our locations without a proportionate increase in direct costs 
this is primarily attributable to obtaining more efficiency from our workforce which is relatively fixed in nature and does not vary directly with increased revenue 
since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which carry different gross profit margins  our future gross profit margins will vary from quarter to quarter  and year to year based upon the mix of our contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects  and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service we perform 
even within category types  the amount of gross profit margins generated might vary due to the unique nature  and size of each contract and project we undertake 
this could impact our future gross profit margins and gross profit comparisons to historical levels 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  we expect our gross profit margins to be lower in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses  or s  g a expenses  increased by in over the increase in total s  g a expenses is primarily due to the expansion of our business  including additional administrative and other personnel costs  health and casualty insurance  depreciation expense  facility costs  public company expenses including professional fees and the cost of complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of additionally  our loss from foreign currency transactions increased to approximately million in from approximately million in in  the addition of pharmanet will result in a substantial increase in our s  g a expenses 
we currently estimate costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance will be approximately million in depreciation expense increased from approximately  in to  in or an increase of 
depreciation is included in both the direct costs and s  g a expense line items in our financial statements 
this increase is primarily attributable to the purchase of our miami facility which houses our principal phase i clinical operation  our primary clinical laboratory and our corporate headquarters 
we previously leased this facility 
the increase is also attributable to significant new purchases of bioanalytical equipment consistent with the growth of bioanalytical revenue and leasehold improvements including the buildout of our new toronto canada bioanalytical laboratory 
amortization expense increased from approximately  in to  in or an increase of 
amortization arises from the intangible assets we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
due to the acquisition of pharmanet and taylor technology in  we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase to approximately  for and approximately  for each of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the pharmanet acquisition were recorded at estimated fair values as determined by our management based on information currently available and on current assumptions as to future operations 
we have allocated the purchase price based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the acquired property  plant and equipment  and identified intangible assets  and their estimated remaining useful lives 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price and the assigned estimated useful lives are subject to revision  based on the final determination of appraised and other fair values  and related tax effects 
interest income expense our interest income materially increased in primarily as a result of our investment of the net proceeds from our august convertible note offering  in which we issued million of convertible notes  and increased cash flows from operations 
our interest expense increased substantially in primarily as the result of the interest on our convertible notes and the mortgage used to purchase our miami facility  and to a lesser extent increased lease equipment expenses in canada 
the convertible notes bear interest at an annual interest rate of which resulted in a total interest expense in of  in  we expect to incur interest expense of approximately million in connection with these notes 
in december  we entered into a million credit facility consisting of a term loan and revolving line of credit 
at december   the balance due under this credit facility was million 
the current interest rate on this variable rate facility is approximately 
based on the amount outstanding at december   and assuming that only the required principal payments are made  the projected interest expense on this facility in is approximately million 
deferred financing costs of million will be amortized over a period of between five and six years and are charged to interest expense 
in february  we filed a registration statement in connection with the public offering by us of  shares of our common stock  shares if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option 
if the offering is completed as contemplated  we intend to use million of the net proceeds received by us from this offering to reduce the principal amount due under our term loan under the credit facility  which will result in a reduction of our interest expense under the credit facility in to approximately million assuming a march completion of the contemplated offering and no increase in interest rates 
upon any voluntary early prepayment of this credit facility  we may be required to incur one time non cash financing charges 
if we complete our public offering and repay the million  we will incur 
table of contents a one time charge of approximately million 
any additional cash proceeds received from the public offering will be invested in short term interest bearing securities  which will result in additional interest income  pending use of these proceeds for possible acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
because we cannot predict with certainty whether or not we will complete this offering  the amount of net proceeds or when we will apply these additional proceeds  we cannot quantify the amount of any additional interest income 
income tax expenses our effective tax rate for was compared to for this increase was primarily attributable to a greater percentage of earnings generated from our united states operations relative to our consolidated earnings 
the effective tax rate from our united states operations is substantially greater than our effective tax rate in canada 
as described elsewhere in this report  anapharm receives significant tax credits from the government of canada relating to its research and development expenses 
these credits lower our effective tax rate in canada 
nevertheless  our effective tax rate from canadian operations increased in because a greater amount of our canadian earnings were generated from operations which did not qualify for these tax credits 
this also contributed to the increase in our overall effective tax rate 
we expect the nature of anapharm s business and the generation of significant tax credits to continue  however  there can be no assurance as to the future amount of these credits on a quarterly or annual basis due to the mix of contracts and the related amounts of research and development activity 
our future effective tax rate will also be dependent on a number of factors  including the relative profits generated in the united states  canada and all other foreign jurisdictions  our ability to utilize canadian tax credits  and the applicable foreign tax rates then in effect 
we expect our effective tax rate in to increase as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet 
earnings per share net earnings increased from approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  an increase of 
the following information with respect to our earnings per share and the number of shares outstanding gives effect to our may for stock split 
on a fully diluted basis  our earnings per share increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the  an increase of 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the principal reasons for the increase in net earnings were the contributions from our canadian operations  principally at anapharm  contributions from our miami facility  which included months of earnings from clinical pharmacology  and the significant earnings from taylor technology  which we acquired in july the increase in the number of fully diluted shares resulted primarily from inclusion for a full year of the  shares issued by the company in a public offering in november  the issuance of approximately  shares in connection with the taylor technology acquisition in july  the issuance of approximately  shares in connection with the pharmanet acquisition in december  the increased dilutive effect of stock options due to the increase in our common stock price and the exercise of approximately  options during the year 
additionally  the number of fully diluted shares outstanding at december  included only part of the shares we issued to acquire clinical pharmacology in because we purchased this business in august excluding any common stock we may issue in connection with future acquisitions and our employee benefit plans  we expect that the fully diluted number of shares outstanding will increase in as the result of shares we expect to issue in connection with the potential payment of million of the clinical pharmacology earn out for the month period ending june  and the shares in our pending public offering assuming we consummate that offering 
further  if the average stock price of our common stock during a reporting period is greater than  then shares reserved for 
table of contents issuance on possible conversion of our convertible senior notes will be included in calculating diluted shares outstanding in an amount equal to the difference between the conversion amount and the outstanding principal amount divided by 
the conversion amount will  for this purpose  be the principal amount divided by multiplied by the average stock price during the period 
additionally  if we complete our pending public offering  we will also include the shares to be issued by us in the offering  shares if the underwriters fully exercise their over allotment option in calculating fully diluted shares 
our balance sheet contains an item entitled accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
this has no impact on our statement of earnings and reflects the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar and is calculated on december st 
in the future  other comprehensive earnings may increase or decrease depending upon the movement of various foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar and based upon the level of inter company activity outside of the united states 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of net revenue for and net revenue gross profit margins earnings before taxes income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted the earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the may three for two stock split effected as a stock dividend 
net revenue our net revenue was approximately million for the year ended december   which was an increase of approximately from approximately million for the prior year 
our increase stemmed from both internal growth and our acquisitions 
the primary reasons for this increase were an increase in anapharm s revenue to approximately million from million  a material increase in our united states phase i and phase ii revenue  our acquisition of clinical pharmacology in august which provided additional phase i revenue of approximately million  and a full year of operations at anapharm and the kennett square  pennsylvania location of sfbc new drug services 
our revenue increased primarily as the result of performing more clinical trials and an increase in the size of our clinical trials 
direct costs direct costs as a percentage of net revenue increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase in our direct costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increase 
table of contents in direct costs in our phase iii business and the inclusion of a full year of phase iii revenue at sfbc new drug services  offset by a reduction in direct costs in our anapharm generic phase i business 
gross profit margins our gross profit margins were in compared to in the largest factor affecting the decrease in our gross profit margins was the decrease in margins in our phase iii business and the inclusion of a full year of operations for sfbc new drug services  offset by an improvement in margins in our generic business at anapharm 
selling  general and administrative expenses our s  g a expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in total s  g a expenses for both periods was primarily due to the expansion of our business  increased payroll  our increased marketing efforts with an expansion from to sales and marketing people  depreciation expenses consistent with our growth over prior year levels  the inclusion of sfbc new drug services s  g a expenses for all of and the inclusion of clinical pharmacology s s  g a expenses for five months in the increase in s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of anapharm expenses 
interest expense our interest expense increased in as the result of our borrowings under our credit facility and the acquisition of additional equipment at anapharm 
we used our credit facility to pay an earn out owed to sfbc new drug services  inc in june to provide working capital in june and to purchase clinical pharmacology in august we repaid the working capital portion of the loan with cash flow from operations and the balance with proceeds from our november public offering of our common stock 
we borrowed an additional million on february  to purchase our principal miami facility which we later replaced with a million permanent mortgage loan 
anapharm acquires its equipment under capital leases in order to take advantage of favorable canadian tax credits which credits exceed our interest expense 
in  anapharm paid  of interest on capital leases in contrast to  in income tax expenses our effective tax rate for was compared to for this decrease was primarily attributable to i the inclusion of sfbc anapharm s significantly lower tax rate  as compared to the united states tax rate  for months in compared to its inclusion for only nine and one half months in  and ii a higher percentage of profits from anapharm relative to consolidated net earnings compared to as described elsewhere in this report  anapharm receives significant tax credits from the government of canada based on its research and development expenditures 
these credits lower our effective tax rate 
earnings per share net earnings increased from approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  an increase of 
on a fully diluted basis  our earnings per share increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the  an increase of 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in the number of fully diluted shares resulted primarily from the issuance of million shares of common stock in connection with our secondary offering in november  the issuance of approximately  shares in connection with the clinical pharmacology acquisition in august  the increase in our common stock price and the exercise of approximately  warrants and options during the year 
additionally  the number of fully 
table of contents diluted shares outstanding at december  included only part of the shares we issued to acquire anapharm and sfbc new drug services  inc in since we made these acquisitions during the year 
effects of inflation our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in contrast to approximately million of net cash provided by operations in the change is primarily due to the substantial increase in net earnings  depreciation and amortization  offset by an increase in net assets  primarily accounts receivable  arising from the growth of our business in for  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million compared to approximately million used in investing activities in the principal reasons for this increase in resulted from approximately million of cash used to fund our acquisitions of pharmanet and taylor technology  approximately million of purchases of equipment and our purchase of approximately million of debt securities 
in  we used approximately million of net cash to acquire clinical pharmacology  synfine  the remaining of nds canada  and to establish sfbc anapharm europe  to purchase approximately million of property and equipment  and to purchase approximately million in marketable securities 
during  net cash of approximately million was provided by financing activities compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to receipt of net proceeds of approximately million after expenses from an offering of convertible notes in august september  our borrowing of million under the term loan and million under the revolving line of credit of our credit facility  offset by approximately million used to repurchase our common stock 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million after expenses from a secondary offering in november  and the receipt of approximately million from the exercise of stock options 
on december   we entered into a million credit facility from a syndicate of banks 
the facility consists of a term loan in the amount of million which is fully funded and a revolving line of credit in the maximum amount of million  which includes amounts available for swingline and letter of credit borrowings 
borrowings under the credit facility provided a portion of the consideration used to acquire pharmanet 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are available for general corporate purposes  and million of borrowings is currently outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the credit facility is guaranteed by each of our united states subsidiaries  and is secured by a mortgage on our facility in miami  florida  a pledge of all of the assets of our united states operations and united states subsidiaries  and a pledge of of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points  and currently calls for increasing principal payments ranging between approximately million and million due quarterly beginning on march  and a final payment due december   subject to certain conditions 
if we complete the proposed public offering of our common stock announced in february  we intend to repay million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan which would result in the required principal payments being reduced to amounts ranging between approximately million and million 
the revolving line of credit bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points and matures on december   subject to certain conditions 
once the term loan has been paid  we may not borrow under it again 
in order to stay in compliance with the terms of the credit facility and to borrow further on the revolving line of credit  we must comply with covenants requiring us  among other things  to maintain certain leverage  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and to limit our annual capital expenditures 
in addition to the required quarterly principal payments  on an annual basis beginning with the year ending december   we will be required to further reduce the principal by an amount equal to of our consolidated excess cash flow  as defined in the credit facility  for that 
table of contents year

the credit facility contains certain covenants that restrict  or may have the effect of restricting  our payment of dividends 
the credit facility also contains certain restrictive covenants that  absent the consent of the administrative agent on behalf of the lenders under the credit facility  limit our ability to enter into acquisitions by setting limits on the maximum aggregate amounts of cash we can pay in acquisition consideration annually and the maximum aggregate amounts we can pay in acquisition consideration during the term of the credit facility  as well as restricting the terms of equity consideration paid in acquisitions 
in connection with the entry into this credit facility  we repaid our million mortgage loan  retired our million credit facility and incurred a one time  charge from the write off of deferred financing costs 
additionally  in august and september we issued million of convertible notes due the notes are redeemable at any time or after august   subject to prior conversion once we give notice of redemption 
additionally  holders of notes may require us to repurchase the notes on august   and upon any redemption we will be required to pay principal and accrued interest 
also  the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time 
the initial conversion price is approximately per share 
if the holder elects to convert  we will be required to pay the conversion value of the underlying shares with up to the principal and accrued interest in cash and the premium  if any  in shares of our common stock 
there is no assurance that we will have sufficient cash to pay the cash amount due upon conversion by the holders of a significant amount of notes who choose to convert their notes during a relatively short time frame 
at march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million of availability under our revolving line of credit 
based upon our cash balances and our cash flows from operations  we believe we have adequate working capital to meet our operational needs for the next months 
a significant component of our business strategy is to seek to make acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and meet certain operational requirements 
if we consummate one or more acquisitions  we expect to use our existing cash  our credit facility and  if necessary  obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund any such acquisitions 
except for stock issued in connection with the clinical pharmacology earn out described below  our proposed public offering announced in february  pursuant to employee benefit plans or the possibility of issuing stock in connection with an accretive acquisitions and the commitments noted below  we do not currently anticipate issuing any of our common stock during at december   we had accrued an additional payable on our balance sheet of approximately million potentially due to former pharmanet stockholders pursuant to our merger agreement with pharmanet 
the merger agreement provided that additional merger consideration will be payable if working capital at the closing date  as determined  exceeded an agreed upon amount 
we may pay the stockholders of clinical pharmacology contingent additional merger consideration of up to million per year  subject to a maximum of million over the three years of the earn out period which are the months ended june   and 
the contingent payments are based upon meeting agreed upon revenue milestones 
if paid  the additional merger consideration will be in equal amounts of cash and sfbc common stock 
the earn out for the first month period was paid in august and reduced our future possible amount payable to million 
based upon business to date  we expect that we will pay million for the month period ending june  this sum will be paid one half cash and one half in shares of our common stock 
this amount is reflected on our balance sheet as a liability at december  we expect to expend approximately million for capital assets in consisting primarily of new equipment to create extra capacity and facilities for future growth 
we anticipate spending up to million in relating to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  which we expect to be primarily attributable to assessing the internal control over financial reporting for pharmanet and taylor technology

in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no 
the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
this issue addresses when contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share 
the 
table of contents eitf concluded that contingently convertible debt instruments co cos should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
co cos are financial instruments that add a contingent feature to a convertible debt instrument and are generally convertible into common stock of the issuer after the common stock price has exceeded a predetermined threshold for a specified time period known as a market price trigger 
the consensus reached by the eitf on this issue will be effective for reporting periods ending after december  the company does not believe that its convertible senior notes as structured meet the definition of co cos  and therefore it does not have a material impact on the company s financial reporting 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions for example  stock options and awards of restricted stock in which an employer receives employee services in exchange for equity securities of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity securities 
this proposal eliminates use of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires such transactions to be accounted for using a fair value based method and recording compensation expense rather than optional pro forma disclosure

 accounting for stock based compensation 
fasb statement r is effective for financial statements of public entities excluding small business issuers  in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  sfbc may reduce its reliance on issuing stock options and begin to use other stock based compensation

for more information regarding some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties of our business  see the following discussion and our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risk factors we have grown rapidly over the last few years  and our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on us 
we have grown rapidly over the last five years  including through acquisitions 
businesses that grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth 
our rapid growth has placed and is expected to continue 
table of contents to place significant demands on our management  on our accounting  financial  information and other systems and on our business 
although we have expanded our management  we need to continue recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees capable of providing the necessary support 
in addition  we will need to continue to improve our financial  accounting  information and other systems in order to effectively manage our growth 
historically  when making acquisitions we have targeted operations that we believe can be operated as autonomous business units 
this decentralization of our operations and systems may create difficulties for us in the future 
we are transitioning our north american subsidiaries  with the exception of pharmanet  to a common accounting software platform 
we cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully  or that our financial  accounting  information or other systems will be able to successfully accommodate our external and internal growth 
our failure to meet these challenges could materially impair our business 
a significant portion of our growth has come from acquisitions  and we plan to make more acquisitions in the future as part of our continuing growth strategy 
this growth strategy subjects us to numerous risks 
a very important aspect of our growth strategy has been and continues to be pursuing strategic acquisitions of related businesses that we believe can expand or complement our business 
since march  we have substantially grown our business through the completion of acquisitions 
acquisitions require significant capital resources and divert management s attention from our existing business 
acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct pre dating our acquisition of a business that were not known to us at the time of acquisition 
we may also incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we had anticipated at the time of its purchase 
in addition  acquisitions may create unanticipated tax and accounting problems  including the possibility that we might be required to write off goodwill which we have paid for in connection with an acquisition 
a key element of our acquisition strategy has been to retain management of acquired businesses to operate the acquired business for us 
many of these individuals maintain important contacts with clients of the acquired business 
our inability to retain these individuals could materially impair the value of an acquired business 
our failure to successfully identify and consummate future acquisitions or to manage and integrate the acquisitions we make could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  we will receive the required consent under our outstanding credit facility  we can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  we can successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or successfully manage the operations of any acquired business  or we will be able to retain an acquired company s significant client relationships  goodwill and key personnel or otherwise realize the intended benefits of any acquisition 
our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that  absent the consent of the administrative agent on behalf of the lenders under the credit facility  limit our ability to enter into acquisitions by setting limits on the maximum aggregate amounts of cash we can pay in acquisition consideration in any fiscal year and the maximum aggregate amount of all acquisition consideration paid during the term of the credit facility  as well as restricting the terms of equity consideration paid in acquisitions 
our december acquisition of pharmanet represented our largest acquisition and has not yet been integrated into our operations 
we completed the acquisition of pharmanet  our largest and most significant acquisition to date  in december our future success is dependent in part upon our ability to effectively integrate pharmanet into our operations 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  we significantly broadened our clinical development services offerings and substantially increased our international presence 
however  there can be 
table of contents no assurance that we will not experience difficulties with clients  personnel  systems integration or otherwise 
nor can there be any assurance that the pharmanet acquisition will enhance our competitive position and business prospects or that the anticipated benefits will be realized 
see risks related to our business we are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of our internal controls for a discussion of risks relating to the evaluation of pharmanet s internal controls 
we are subject to changes in outsourcing trends and regulatory requirements affecting the branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device industries which could adversely affect our operating results 
economic factors and industry and regulatory trends that affect our primary clients  branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device companies  also affect our business and operating results 
the outsourcing of drug development activities grew substantially during the past decade and we benefited from this trend 
if these industries reduce the outsourcing of their clinical research and other drug development projects  our operations will be adversely affected 
a continuing negative trend could have an ongoing adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
numerous governments have undertaken efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation  regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and pharmaceutical companies 
potential regulatory changes under consideration include the mandatory substitution of generic drugs for innovator drugs  relaxation in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures 
if future regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profits which can be derived from new and generic drugs or if regulatory approval standards are relaxed  our clients may reduce the business they outsource to us 
we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these events 
if branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device companies reduce their expenditures  our future revenue and profitability may be reduced 
our business and continued expansion depend on the research and development expenditures of our clients which in turn is impacted by their profitability 
if these companies want to reduce costs  they may proceed with fewer clinical trials and other drug development 
an economic downturn or other factors may cause our clients to decrease their research and development expenditures which would adversely affect our future revenue and profitability 
if we do not continue to generate a large number of new client contracts  or if our clients cancel or defer contracts  our future profitability may be adversely affected 
our early stage contracts are short term and our late stage contracts generally extend over a period of one to two years  although some may be of longer duration 
however  all of our contracts are generally cancelable by our clients with little or no notice 
a client may cancel or delay existing contracts with us at its discretion and is likely to do so for a variety of reasons  including manufacturing problems resulting in a shortage or unavailability of the drug we are testing  a decision by a client to de emphasize or cancel the development of a drug  unexpected clinical trial results  adverse participant reaction to a drug  an action by regulatory authorities for example  in the united states  the food and drug administration  or fda  and in canada  the therapeutic products directorate  or tpd  and inadequate participant enrollment 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we must continually replace our existing contracts with new contracts to sustain our revenue 
our inability to generate new contracts on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  since a large portion of our operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing and progress of contracts can 
table of contents materially affect our financial results 
the loss or delay of a large project or contract or the loss or delay of multiple smaller contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced termination  cancellation and delay of contracts by clients from time to time in the past in the ordinary course of our business 
at any given time  one or a limited number of clients may account for a large percentage of our revenue  which means that we could face a greater risk of loss of revenue if we lose a major client 
historically  a small number of clients have generated a large percentage of our revenue in any given period 
in each of  and  no client provided more than of our revenue  but our largest clients provided approximately   and of our revenue 
pharmanet also relies on a limited number of clients which generate a significant percentage of its revenue 
during and  revenue not including reimbursed out of pockets from four of pharmanet s clients provided approximately and of such revenue  respectively 
during two clients provided approximately and  respectively  of pharmanet s revenue not including reimbursed out of pockets 
companies that constitute our largest clients vary from year to year  and our revenue from individual clients fluctuates each year 
if we lose one or more major clients in the future or if one or more clients encounter financial difficulties  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may bear financial risk if we under price our contracts or overrun cost estimates 
we bear the financial risk if we initially under price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates 
such under pricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of our internal controls 
in connection with past audits most recently the audit for the year ended december   grant thornton llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  notified our management and audit committee of the existence of significant deficiencies in internal controls  which is an accounting term for internal controls deficiencies that  in the judgment of our independent registered public accounting firm  are significant and which could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial information 
grant thornton did not conclude at that time that the significant deficiencies  either individually or in the aggregate  constituted a material weakness in our internal controls 
in connection with the audit for the year ended december   grant thornton issued a report where it agreed with our management s assessment that our internal control over financial reporting did not contain any material weaknesses 
in we spent over million on software  independent consulting fees and additional fees to our independent auditors in connection with documenting and testing our internal controls systems and procedures and making improvements that we believed were necessary in order for us to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and the related sec rules 
as permitted by sec rules  we did not include our acquisitions in our management s assessment of internal controls as of december  however  as of december   we will be required to assess the effectiveness of the internal controls of the companies we acquired in  including pharmanet  in addition to those of our existing business 
pharmanet is a decentralized international company with offices in north and south america  europe  asia and australia 
prior to its acquisition by us  pharmanet was a privately held business 
privately held businesses are not subject to the same requirements for internal controls as public companies 
in connection with its audit of pharmanet for the year ended december   pharmanet s independent auditors identified significant deficiencies in certain aspects of pharmanet s internal controls which pharmanet s independent auditors concluded constituted a material weakness in pharmanet s internal controls 
these deficiencies generally related to pharmanet s accounting for international subsidiary results 
while pharmanet began to remediate these significant deficiencies prior to its acquisition by us and while we intend to address any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies at pharmanet during the year  there is no assurance that this will be accomplished 
if we fail to strengthen the 
table of contents effectiveness of pharmanet s internal controls  we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our indebtedness may impact our financial condition and results of operations and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness may limit our activities 
on december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness 
subject to applicable restrictions in our outstanding indebtedness  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation we will be required to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest due on our outstanding indebtedness  our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase the impact of negative changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as competitive pressures  and the level of our outstanding indebtedness may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate tied to libor and approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a fixed rate of per year 
accordingly  if interest rates increase  then the amount of the interest payments on our floating rate indebtedness will also increase 
general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control  may affect our future performance 
as a result  these and other factors may affect our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
our business might not continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
moreover  if we are required to repatriate foreign earnings in order to pay our debt service  we may incur additional income taxes 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness  we may  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  or reduce or delay planned capital expenditures 
these measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness 
in addition  any financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms  if at all 
furthermore  our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which will affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  make investments or loans  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  issue capital stock  make capital expenditures  sell assets  and pursue mergers or acquisitions 

table of contents these covenants  unless waived  may limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities 
we may not have sufficient funds to pay the principal return upon conversion or to repurchase our outstanding convertible senior notes under circumstances when we are required to do so 
we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time 
the initial conversion rate of the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
this is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
however  the notes provide for what is known as net share settlement upon conversion 
this means that upon conversion of the notes  we will be required to pay up to  in cash  per  principal amount of notes  and  if applicable  issue a number of shares of our common stock based upon the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
the conversion value of the notes is based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the ten trading day period commencing the second trading day after we receive notice of conversion 
the conversion value must be paid as soon as practicable after it is determined 
in addition  holders of the notes may require us to purchase their notes for cash on august   august  and august  and  under certain circumstances  in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture under which the notes were issued 
further  if a fundamental change occurs prior to august   we will be required to pay a make whole premium in addition to the repurchase price which may be payable at our election in cash or shares of our common stock valued at of the then current market price or a combination of both 
we may not have sufficient funds at any such time to make the required payment upon conversion or to purchase the notes and we may not be able to raise sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations 
furthermore  the terms of our existing credit facility contains  and the terms of other indebtedness that we may incur in the future may contain  financial covenants or other provisions that could be violated by payment of the required amounts upon conversion or the repurchase of the notes 
our failure to pay the required amounts on conversion of any of the notes when converted or to repurchase any of the notes when we are required to do so would result in an event of default with respect to the notes  which could result in the entire outstanding principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest on all of the notes being accelerated and could also result in an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness 
our actual financial results might vary from our publicly disclosed preliminary results and forecasts 
our actual financial results might vary from those anticipated by us  and these variations could be material 
after each fiscal quarter and each fiscal year  we typically announce preliminary revenues and earnings information for the period then ended 
while we believe such preliminary information is accurate  our financial results for the period then ended would not have been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors at the time of such announcement and are subject to possible revision 
in addition  from time to time we publicly provide earnings guidance 
our forecasts reflect numerous assumptions concerning our expected performance  as well as other factors  which are beyond our control  and which might not turn out to be correct 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying our projections are reasonable  actual results could be materially different 
our financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those identified throughout these risk factors and elsewhere in this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus 
if our actual earnings vary from our preliminary announced results or our guidance  our common stock price may decline 
our operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period 
our operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations are usually due to the level of new business awards in a particular period and the timing of the initiation  progress  or cancellation of significant projects 
even a short acceleration or delay in such projects could have a material effect on our results in a given reporting period 
varying periodic results could adversely affect the price of 
table of contents our common stock if investors react to our reporting operating results which are less favorable than in a prior period or than those anticipated by investors or the financial community generally 
if we are required to write off goodwill or other intangible assets  our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  which constituted approximately and  respectively  of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is subject to international economic  political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside the united states 
further  we anticipate that revenue from international operations may grow in the future 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  including less stable political and economic environments and changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  potential negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting our ability to repatriate profits  unfavorable labor regulations  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  currency fluctuations  changes in trade policies  regulatory requirements and other barriers  civil unrest or other catastrophic events  and longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions 
these factors are beyond our control 
the realization of any of these or other risks associated with operating in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our substantial non united states operations expose us to currency risks 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar  euros or other foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
due to the acquisition of pharmanet  which has locations worldwide  we will be subject to exchange rate gains and losses for multiple currencies 
we also may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk when our service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which we incur expenses or earn fees related to such contracts 
for example  our canadian operations often perform services for a fixed price denominated in us dollars or in euros while their payroll and other expenses are primarily canadian dollar expenses 
we did not enter into any material transactions to hedge our foreign currency risks in and incurred a pre tax loss from foreign currency transactions relating to our canadian operations for the year of approximately million or per diluted share after taxes 
we are currently in the process of adopting a formal foreign currency risk hedging policy to attempt to mitigate this risk in the future 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in limiting risks associated with foreign currency transactions 

table of contents we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada 
our operations in canada currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements 
we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments 
our canadian operations employ a large number of research and development employees which results in significant expenses related to these services 
due to the nature of these services  the canadian government subsidizes a portion of these expenses through tax credits that result in a reduced effective tax rate as well as a significant deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
however  there is no assurance that the credits will be fully realized 
further  any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits could have a material adverse effect on our profits and cash flow from our canadian operations 
governmental authorities may question our inter company transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax or otherwise harm our business 
as a united states company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries  we are subject to foreign tax and inter company pricing laws  including those relating to the flow of funds between our company and our subsidiaries 
regulators in the united states and in foreign markets closely monitor our corporate structure and how we effect inter company fund transfers 
if regulators challenge our corporate structure  transfer pricing mechanisms or inter company transfers  our operations may be negatively impacted and our effective tax rate may increase 
tax rates vary from country to country and if regulators determine that our profits in one jurisdiction may need to be increased  we may not be able to fully utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated  which would increase our effective tax rate 
we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all applicable customs  exchange control and transfer pricing laws despite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws 
further  if these laws change  we may need to adjust our operating procedure and our business could be adversely affected 
because we are smaller than our largest competitors  we may lack the resources needed to compete effectively 
there are a large number of drug development services companies ranging in size from one person firms to full service  global drug development corporations 
intense competition may lead to price pressure or other conditions that could adversely affect our business 
some of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial  human and other resources 
we may lack the operating and financial resources needed to compete effectively 
if we do not continue to develop new scientific methods  or assays  for our analytical applications  we may be unable to compete with other entities offering bioanalytical laboratory services 
we must continuously develop scientific methods to test drug products in order to meet the needs of our clients and attract new clients 
in order to substantially increase the business of our bioanalytical laboratories  which provide services for branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug companies  we must be able to provide solutions for our clients 
this requires staying abreast of current regulatory requirements and identifying methods and applications that will assist our clients in obtaining approval for their products 
if we are not successful in developing new methods and applications  we may lose our clients 
we risk potential liability when conducting clinical trials  which could cost us large amounts of money 
our clinical trials involve administering drugs to humans in order to determine the effects of the drugs 
by doing so  we are subject to the general risks of liability to these persons  which include those relating to adverse side effects and reactions resulting from administering these drugs to a clinical trial participant  unintended consequences resulting from the procedures and or changes in medical practice to which a study participant may be subject as part of a clinical trial  improper administration of these drugs  or 
table of contents potential professional malpractice of our employees or contractors  including physicians 
our contracts may not have adequate indemnification agreements requiring our clients to indemnify us in the event of adverse consequences to our participants caused by their drugs or participation in their trials 
we also carry liability insurance but there is no certainty as to the adequacy  or the continued availability at rates acceptable to us  of such liability insurance 
we could also be held liable for other errors or omissions in connection with our services 
for example  we could be held liable for errors or omissions or breach of contract if our laboratories inaccurately report or fail to report lab results 
if we do not perform our services to contractual or regulatory standards  the clinical trial process could be adversely affected 
additionally  if clinical trial services such as laboratory analysis do not conform to contractual or regulatory standards  trial participants could be affected 
if there is a damage claim not covered by insurance  the indemnification agreement is not enforceable or broad enough  or our client is insolvent  any resulting award against us could result in our experiencing large losses 
we face a risk of liability from our handling and disposal of medical wastes  which could cause us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect us 
our clinical trial activities and laboratory services involve the controlled disposal of medical wastes  which are considered hazardous materials 
although we may use reputable third parties to dispose of medical waste  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if this occurs  we could be held liable for clean up costs  damages  face significant fines  and face the temporary or permanent shutdown of our operations 
failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations could harm our operating results and reputation 
we may be subject to regulatory action  which in some jurisdictions includes criminal sanctions  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
failure to comply can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials 
this could harm our reputation  our prospects for future work and our operating results 
a finding by the fda that we are not in compliance with good laboratory practices  or glp  standards for our laboratories  current good manufacturing practices  or gmp  standards  and or good clinical practices  or gcp  standards for our clinical facilities could materially and adversely affect us 
similarly  a finding by the tpd that we are not in compliance with canadian good manufacturing practices  or canadian gmp  standards  and or canadian good clinical practices  or canadian gcps  and or other legislative requirements for clinical trials in canada  could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition to the above united states and canadian laws and regulations  we must comply with the laws of all countries where we do business  including laws governing clinical trials in the jurisdiction where the trials are performed 
failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to regulatory risk  liability and potential costs associated with redoing the trials which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
if we lose the services of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified staff  our business could be adversely affected 
our success is substantially dependent upon the performance  contributions and expertise of our senior management team  including  among others  lisa krinsky  md  arnold hantman  md  gregory b 
holmes  pharmd  david natan  pharmd  marc lebel  pharmd  johanne boucher champagne  francois vallee  allan xu  phd  paul taylor  phd  and more recently jeffrey p 
mcmullen  thomas j 
newman  md  and robert reekie  md in addition  members of our senior management team play a very significant role in the generation of new business and retention of existing clients 
we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management  professional and operating staff 
our loss of the services of any of the members of senior management  or any other key executive  or our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information technology infrastructure  and failures of this infrastructure could harm our operations 
to remain competitive in our industry  we must employ information technologies that capture  manage  and analyze the large streams of data generated during our clinical trials in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
in addition  because we provide services on a global basis  we rely extensively on our technology to allow the concurrent conduct of studies and work sharing around the world 
as with all information technology  our system is vulnerable to potential damage or interruptions from fires  blackouts  telecommunications failures  and other unexpected events  as well as to break ins  sabotage  or intentional acts of vandalism 
given the extensive reliance of our business on this technology  any substantial disruption or resulting loss of data that is not avoided or corrected by our backup measures could harm our business and operations 
we may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future which could cause dilution to new investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price 
a key element of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions 
as part of our acquisition strategy  we may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisitions 
these issuances could be significant 
to the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration  your equity interest in us will be diluted 
any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future 
persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be likely to sell off their common stock rather than hold their shares for investment  which may impact the price of our common stock 
in addition  the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained 
we may issue common stock in the future for other purposes as well  including in connection with financings  for compensation purposes  in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes 
recent changes in accounting standards could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees  and could also negatively impact our results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board is requiring all companies to treat the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  when this change becomes effective  we and other companies will be required to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option granted 
currently  we are generally not required to record compensation expense in connection with stock option grants 
when we are required to expense the fair value of stock option grants  it may reduce the attractiveness of granting stock options because of the additional expense associated with these grants  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
for example  had we been required to expense stock option grants by applying the measurement provisions of statement r  our recorded net income for the years ended december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  would have been reduced to approximately million and million  respectively 
stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we reduce the scope of our employee stock option program 
accordingly  when we are required to expense stock option grants  our future results of operations will be negatively impacted 
our stock price can be extremely volatile  and your investment could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to be  volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  including changes in our guidance as to forecasted earnings  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  
table of contents loss of a major client or contract  new service offerings introduced or announced by our competitors  changes in market valuations of other similar companies  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our common stock  including short sales 
as a result  investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in addition  the stock market in general experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult  which could depress our stock price 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
our charter documents provide that our board of directors may issue  without a vote of our stockholders  one or more series of preferred stock that has more than one vote per share 
this could permit our board of directors to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management 
additionally  issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in the price of our common stock and a decline in interest in the stock  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is performing well 
our bylaws also limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders and establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
in addition  provisions of certain contracts  such as employment agreements with our executive officers  may have an anti takeover effect

prior to our acquisition of pharmanet  our currency translation risks arose primarily from our canadian operations 
the aggregate effect of translating the financial statements of our canadian operations is included in a separate component of stockholders equity entitled accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
for the year ended december   we had a pre tax loss from foreign currency transactions of  or per diluted share after taxes relating to our canadian operations 
our acquisition of pharmanet  which has significant global operations  subjects us to increased currency risks relating to various foreign currencies 
we are currently in the process of adopting a formal foreign currency risk hedging policy to attempt to mitigate our foreign currency risk 
we may not be successful in this regard 
interest rate risk we have a million credit facility

the interest rate on this credit facility is libor based and variable 
this credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our united states subsidiaries and a pledge of of the capital stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
changes in interest rates  and libor in particular  will affect our cost of funds under this facility 
a change in our variable rate credit facility would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately
