our business is subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion and the section in item of this report entitled business risks describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview we manufacture  market and distribute charles colvard created moissanite jewels also called moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market 
moissanite  also known by its chemical name  silicon carbide sic  is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteorites 
as the sole manufacturer of scientifically made moissanite jewels  our strategy is to create a unique brand image which positions moissanite as a jewel in its own right  distinct from all other jewels based on its fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
moissanite is being marketed as a new product category and business opportunity for the jewelry trade 
we began shipping moissanite to domestic retail jewelers and international distributors during the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we changed our domestic distribution model to sell through jewel distributors and jewelry manufacturers rather than directly to retail stores 
in march  we entered into distribution agreements with stuller settings  inc stuller and rio grande  two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  for the north american distribution of moissanite 
we have also entered into several agreements with domestic jewelry manufacturers  including k g creations and reeves park  which are currently our two largest customers 
through these agreements with distributors and jewelry manufacturers and the brand awareness created by our marketing program  we have sought to rapidly increase the introduction of moissanite into the domestic jewelry market while maintaining average selling prices 
although these distribution and marketing strategies enabled us to achieve profitability in the last four completed fiscal years  we have no assurance that they will be successful in the long term 
in october  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong  charles colvard hk ltd  for the purpose of gaining better access to the important far eastern markets 
the importance of having a presence in this market is twofold  hong kong is the headquarters city for a very large number of jewelry manufacturing companies with sales and distribution worldwide  and hong kong is the gateway to the markets of mainland china 
to enhance our presence in this market  we established a charles colvard controlled company in china in august during  we focused on the domestic market  while investing limited resources in certain international markets that management believes represent the most potential 
our sales were higher than sales in with sustained profitability and positive cash flow 
in  we increased our sales and marketing expenses to expand product awareness and provide support to retailers  thereby accelerating sales growth 
the majority of the increased expenses were focused on the domestic market however we also increased our marketing and sales investment in hong kong and china 
our sales were higher in over during  we continued our increased investment in sales and marketing expenses to accelerate our growth rate 
our sales in were higher than and we remained profitable 
we believe that our increased investment in sales and marketing expenses will lead to further revenue growth in and beyond 
although our goals for are to continue increasing sales while sustaining profitability  we cannot be sure that either goal will be achieved 

table of contents in a joint effort with our manufacturing customer  reeves park of minneapolis  we launched a charles colvard moissanite jewelry category at jcpenney retail locations on october  jcpenney also offers moissanite jewelry in its catalog and online 
the program was supported with extensive advertising and public relations activities  as well as by in store events and promotions 
initially  the jewelry placed in this distribution was on consignment with the retailer 
in march  jcpenney began offering moissanite in additional stores 
while the majority of the distribution at jcpenney is through consignment  current distribution consists of a mixture of asset purchase and consignment 
there were several other new retailers introducing moissanite jewelry during the fourth quarter of  including a store test in the store daniel s jewelry  a store test in the store alvin s jewelry  a store test in the store boscov s department stores and a store test at the store migerobe leased department store chain 
in addition  there were trunk show tests in stores whose jewelry departments are leased to finlay enterprises 
finlay operates leased department store jewelry locations in chains such as robinson may  lord taylor  and marshall fields 
in february  we announced that moissanite jewelry will be available at finlay leased department store jewelry counters by march april results of operations the following table is intended to illustrate a tabular analysis of certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of sales for all periods presented 
a detailed explanation of our results of operations follows this table 
year ended december  sales gross profit marketing sales expenses g a expenses operating income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
shipments of moissanite jewels  excluding consigned jewels  also increased to approximately  carats from  carats in the average selling price per carat was the same in both years as we sold a comparable product mix 
domestic sales accounted for approximately and of sales during and  respectively 
domestic net sales and carat shipments increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increased domestic shipments are due primarily to the launch of moissanite at jcpenney  as well as higher volume of sales to stuller following their first release of a twenty page moissanite jewelry catalog for retailers 
our three largest customers  k g creations  reeves park  and stuller  accounted for   and  respectively  of our sales during the year ended december  k g creations and reeves park  domestic manufacturing customers  provide moissanite jewels and jewelry to a customer base that consists primarily of television shopping channels and traditional retail stores 
stuller  the largest supplier to domestic independent jewelers  provides both moissanite jewels and a limited line of moissanite jewelry to its customers 
while we believe our current relationship with these customers is good  and alternate manufacturers and distributors are available to serve their customer base  a loss of any of these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period 
based on our 
table of contents inventory on consignment with reeves park for jcpenney  and planned advertising and promotional support for this program  the company expects its relationship with reeves park and indirectly jcpenney to become more significant in future periods and that the company will become  at least in the short term  more dependent on maintaining and enhancing its jcpenney program 
international net sales and carat shipments increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from sales increases in singapore  dubai  and korea  resulting from increased promotions in these areas 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increased gross margin percentage was primarily caused by lower cost inventory items being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy 
future gross margins will fluctuate based upon our average selling price per carat and the costs being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy 
the costs being relieved from inventory should trend lower over time  with variations quarter to quarter  as we have achieved declining production costs over the past few years 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to from in the primary reasons for the increase are  and  of increased advertising expenses at the us and hong kong offices  respectively  to promote customer sales opportunities at new and existing retailers 
this increase was partially offset by  of advertising production costs in  not incurred in  associated with the redesign of our advertising message 
we increased our investment in sales and marketing expenses during in an effort to increase our sales growth and support the new retailers introducing moissanite jewelry 
we expect to continue increasing this investment in while total sales and marketing expenses should increase in  our plan is for these expenses to be comparable to as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
although there was an increase in these expenses  as a percentage of sales these expenses decreased to from in the increase in expenses is primarily due to  of increased professional fees and  of increased compensation costs 
the primary reason for the increase in compensation costs was  of accrued compensation cost in under our fiscal year executive compensation plan  as amended the executive compensation plan 
there were no costs recorded in under the executive compensation plan as the company did not meet its internal sales and profit goals 
the net increase in general and administrative expenses was reduced by  in non recurring legal fees incurred in relating to settled litigation 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from a higher interest rate earned on our cash balances 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our statutory tax rate is and consists of the federal income tax rate of and north carolina income tax rate of  net of the federal benefit 
our effective income tax rate is higher than our statutory rate primarily due to our inability to currently recognize an income tax benefit for our operating losses in hong kong and china 
we cannot recognize this income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in these countries to offset the existing losses 
our effective income tax rate is lower in than primarily due to the benefit of certain research tax credits 
after a detailed review of the company s research activities  the amount of the research credits expected to be realized was increased in 
table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
although shipments of moissanite jewels  excluding consigned jewels  decreased by in to approximately  carats from  carats in  sales increased due to a increase in the average selling price per carat 
the average selling price per carat increased primarily due to a product mix in which a greater percentage of larger size jewels  which have a higher price per carat  were sold 
domestic sales accounted for approximately of sales in and in domestic carat shipments in decreased by and international carat shipments increased by 
the decrease in domestic carat shipments during is due to decreased hours of moissanite sales broadcasting on the television shopping channel shopnbc 
shopnbc announced  starting in february  their intention to decrease jewelry as a percentage of total sales 
other domestic retail outlets experienced sales growth in the moissanite category 
our two largest customers in  k g creations and stuller  accounted for and  respectively  of our sales during that year 
k g creations  a domestic manufacturing customer  provides moissanite jewels and jewelry to a large and diversified customer base  including television shopping channels and traditional retail stores 
stuller  the largest supplier to domestic independent jewelers  provides both moissanite jewels and a limited line of moissanite jewelry to its customers 
increased international sales into taiwan and vietnam were partially offset by a sales decrease into england 
the increase in taiwan can be attributed to the successful introduction of moissanite on a television shopping channel and the increase in vietnam is due to the opening of a moissanite only store in that country 
the reduced sales in england were caused by a de emphasis of moissanite by our english manufacturer 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin percentage in was negatively impacted by the establishment of a  lower of cost or market reserve 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for an explanation of this reserve 
our gross margin percentage for would have been ignoring the effect of this inventory reserve 
the gross margin percentage in was adversely affected by decreased yields of moissanite jewels from sic crystals during the period being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy  partially offset by the increase in the average selling price per carat 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to from in the primary reason for the increase was our advertising campaign designed to support the new jewelry chains that are testing moissanite jewelry and to stimulate moissanite tests by other chains 
our campaign featured a new advertising message and expanded the placement of advertisements in fashion magazines and billboards 
we incurred  of production costs associated with changing the look and feel of our advertising message 
the increased number of advertisement placements resulted in  of increased costs over during  we incurred  of increased marketing and sales costs over associated with the expansion of our offices in hong kong and china 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a  decrease in our co op advertising expense 
our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us 
the decrease in this expense during is due to the reduction in the amount of allowable credit given to one of our major customers 

table of contents general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
although there was an increase in these expenses  as a percentage of sales these expenses decreased to from in increased professional fees of  were offset by decreased compensation costs of  pertaining to our executive compensation plan 
the primary reason for the increase in professional fees was legal fees of approximately  in related to now settled litigation 
our executive compensation plan was effective for  however  no costs were recorded in as the company did not meet its internal sales and profit goals 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate earned on our cash balances 
income tax expense was  for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   as discussed below 
our effective income tax rate for was 
this rate is higher than our statutory rate of due to our inability to deduct currently  of non us operating losses 
as a result of sustained profitability in and  we recorded a one time  non operating and non cash addition to earnings in the fourth quarter of to reflect the expected future income tax benefits from our deferred income tax assets primarily our net operating loss carryforwards 
the benefit is due to the reversal of the deferred income tax valuation allowance that existed in prior periods 
we established a valuation allowance in prior periods due to the uncertainty of whether we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred income tax assets 
we believe our sustained profitability in and was an indication that it became more likely than not that we would fully realize our deferred income tax assets 
recognition of this asset resulted in the recording of income tax expense in each quarter of and this expense will be recorded in all future profitable periods 
however  us federal income tax payments will only resume once the tax net operating loss carryforwards million at december  have been completely utilized or if alternative minimum taxes are applicable 
pro forma amounts are shown below to compare net income in and  excluding this one time gain and as if we had recorded us income tax expense during utilizing a combined state and federal effective tax rate of of us taxable income 
management believes that this pro forma information is useful to investors in comparing results of operations on a us tax equivalent basis 
year ended december  as reported income before income tax expense income tax expense benefit net income net income per diluted share year ended december  pro forma income before income tax expense income tax expense of us taxable income net income net income per diluted share 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
cash and inventory account for of our current assets 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
during the year ended december    of cash was provided by operations 
the primary reason for the increase in cash from operating activities was pretax income of  and a  increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a  increase in receivables 
the large increase in receivables is due to the high volume of sales in the month of december our investing activities for the year ended december  resulted in  of cash used for the purchase of furniture and equipment and  on patent and license rights costs 
there was  of cash provided by financing activities during cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  were partially offset by  of funds used to repurchase common stock under our follow on repurchase program 
more details on this program are discussed below 
income tax payments for the year ended december  were limited to  due to the utilization of a portion of the company s net operating loss nol carryforwards to offset the taxable income generated during that period by our us operations 
as of december   we had a united states nol carryforward of approximately million  which expires between and federal and state income tax payments will be limited in future periods to primarily alternative minimum tax payments until the nol has been completely utilized 
periodically  the company sells product to customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period 
the company does not recognize revenue on these transactions until the earlier of the customer informing the company that it will keep the product or the expiration of the memo period 
prior to  these types of sales have not been significant and the company recorded accounts receivable and deferred gross profit on these transactions at the time of shipment 
at december    of our receivables related to sales on memo terms and there was  of deferred gross profit on the balance sheet 
in  the company experienced a significant increase in memo sales and determined that  effective january   product shipped to our customers on memo terms that do not meet all of the relevant criteria for recording as a sale would be classified as inventory on consignment on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the  of inventory on consignment at december  represents potential revenue of  and potential gross profit of  since memo transactions were not material prior to  we have not reclassified our december  balance sheet to conform to the presentation 
on average  using historical results as a basis  finished jewels are held in inventory up to months prior to being sold 
as sales increase  we expect the number of months finished jewels are held in inventory to decrease 
prior to the build up in the company s inventory was a material use of the company s cash flow 
management considered this investment in inventory essential to be able to meet the orders of its expanding customer base and to fulfill the new and expanding requests from our customers for consigned inventory 
it is management s opinion that total inventory should decrease slightly over time from current levels due to forecasted sales increases  and that inventory turnover should increase  thereby not requiring a significant use of working capital and providing a source of future cash flow 
however  the company will maintain inventories to support its forecasted increases in demand for its product 
in february  we agreed with cree on a framework for purchases for the company is obligated to purchase a minimum quantity of usable material on a quarterly basis if cree meets certain minimum quality levels 
for each quarter during  the company has committed to purchase approximately  of raw material  assuming the quality of material is consistent with that received in 
table of contents in february we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with norstel ab formerly jesperator ab for the supply of silicon carbide sic for use in the manufacturing of moissanite jewels 
the initial term of the contract is for three years  and involves the supply of material worth a minimum of approximately million over three years 
from time to time since  the company has repurchased shares through a common stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors  authorizing management to repurchase shares of common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices at or below prevailing prices 
pursuant to this authority  the company repurchased  shares at per share in   shares at an average price of in  and  shares at an average price of per share in in december  the board of directors authorized a follow on repurchase program for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
at the discretion of management  the repurchase program can be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices at or below prevailing prices 
during the year ended december   there were  shares repurchased at an average price of 
this program expired in december the board of directors will determine whether to authorize an additional follow on repurchase program based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
based on our cash and cash equivalents and other working capital  management believes that our existing capital resources are adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations consist of our purchase commitments with cree and norstel  the operating lease on our building and the operating leases for our companies in hong kong and china 
below are the amounts of these commitments in tabular form 
payments due by period contractual obligations total beyond purchase commitments cree operating leases purchase commitments norstel during  we are committed to purchase approximately  of raw material each quarter assuming the quality of material is consistent with that received in these amounts are the minimum purchase amounts 
if norstel ab has capacity to manufacture additional sic  our total commitment could reach million contingent on norstel ab meeting our quality standards 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had a united states net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million  which expires between and in accordance with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a change in equity ownership of greater than within a three year period will result in an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards that were created during tax periods prior to the change in ownership 
as a result of various equity offerings and certain shareholder transactions  the utilization of a portion of our nol carryforwards has become limited  but this limitation will not have a material effect on our ability to utilize the nol carryforward 

table of contents as of december   there was approximately million in nol carryforwards in hong kong 
in accordance with the hong kong tax code these amounts can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in hong kong 
due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in hong kong to utilize this nol  we have established a valuation allowance against this deferred income tax asset 
as of december   there was approximately  in nol carryforwards in china 
in accordance with the china tax code these amounts can be carried forward years to offset future taxable income in china 
due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in china to utilize this nol  we have established a valuation allowance against this deferred income tax asset 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to costing and classification of inventories  revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  and co op advertising 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
our inventories consist primarily of colorless moissanite jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry 
moissanite jewels that do not meet our grading criteria and therefore are not deemed to be saleable are not included in inventories 
we carry only a limited amount of moissanite jewels in finished jewelry settings 
as a result  our inventories do not degrade in quality over time and are not subject to fashion trends 
our distribution channels include two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  jewelry manufacturers  traditional retail stores  home shopping channels and catalogs 
consequently  significant amounts of inventories must be maintained at all times 
during  we established a lower of cost or market reserve of  to allow for a portion of the finished goods inventory to be re cut 
there are certain shapes and sizes of jewels in inventory that can be re cut to achieve higher quality standards 
the reserve is necessary to allow for the carat weight loss during the re cutting process 
to determine this reserve  we estimated the amount of inventory that is anticipated to be re cut and the amount of weight loss that will occur during the process 
since the establishment of this reserve  we have not yet re cut any jewels 
at december   the reserve remained at  revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped 
our standard payment terms for all customers are between to days 
some customers are required to prepay prior to shipment 
for all jewels shipped title passes upon shipment of the jewels from our facility ie  fob shipping point 
periodically  the company sells product to customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period 
our customers are generally required to make payments on memo shipments within days upon the customer informing the company that it will keep the product 
accordingly  the company does not recognize revenue on these memo transactions until the earlier of the customer informing the company that it will keep the product or the expiration of the right of return period 
prior to  these types of sales have not been significant and the company recorded accounts receivable and deferred gross profit on these transactions at the time of shipment 
at december   there was  of deferred gross profit on the balance sheet 
in  the company experienced a significant increase in memo sales and determined that  effective january   product shipped to our 
table of contents customers on memo terms that do not meet all of the relevant criteria for recording as a sale would be classified as inventory on consignment on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the  of inventory on consignment at december  represents potential revenue of  and potential gross profit of  estimates are used to determine the amount of two reserves against accounts receivable 
first  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reduce accounts receivable to an amount expected to be collected 
based on our collection history  we determine a percentage based on the age of the receivable that we deem collectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
any increases or decreases to this allowance are charged or credited to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the second reserve against accounts receivable is the allowance for returns 
at the time revenue is recognized  we estimate future returns and reduce sales and accounts receivable by this estimated amount 
this amount is estimated using the historical return rate for our company 
the allowance for returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the large increase in the reserve in is due to higher fourth quarter sales in than we offer a co op advertising program to many of our customers that reimburses a portion of their marketing costs based on their net purchases from us 
at the end of any given period  we estimate the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers 
these amounts were  and  at december  and  respectively 
we estimate this amount based on our historical experience with each customer  and the related contractual arrangements to provide certain levels of co op advertising for our customers 
newly issued accounting pronouncements in november  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 inventory costs  was issued 
this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
fas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  fas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have an effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  fas no 
r  share based payments  was issued  as a revision to fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
fas r also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under fas statement r must be adopted no later than the first interim or annual period beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
the company expects to adopt statement r on july   the beginning of its third quarter 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost 
table of contents for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method could have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and other factors 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is not significant because our investments are limited to highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less 
at december   the majority of our cash was in short term investments classified as cash and equivalents 
all of our transactions with international customers and suppliers are denominated in us dollars
