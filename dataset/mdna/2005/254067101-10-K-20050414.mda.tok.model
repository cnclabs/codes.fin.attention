if our customers do not purchase our merchandise offerings in sufficient qu antities  we respond by taking markdowns 
if we have to reduce our prices  the cost of goods sold on our income statement w ill correspondingly rise  thus reducing our income 
o success of brand the success of our exclusive brand merchandise is d ependent upon customer fashion preferences 
o store growth our growth is dependent on a number of factors whic h could prevent the opening of new stores  such as identifying suitable markets and locations 
o sourcing store merchandise is dependent upon adequate and stable av ailability of materials and production facilities from which the company sources its merchandise

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes t o consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requi res management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circu mstances 
actual results will differ from these under different assumptions or conditions 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
approximately of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the retail last in  first out lifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retai l ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practic ality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if mark downs are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain signifi cant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact t he ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that the company s rim provid es an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
the remaining of the inventories a re valued at lower of cost or market using the specific identified cost method 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  the company sold substantially all of its accounts receivable to ge and no longer maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts 
prior to the sale  the accounts receivable from the company s private label credit card sales were subject to credit losses 
the company maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losse s resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the adequacy of the allowance was based on historical ex perience with similar customers including write off trends  current aging information and year end balances 
bankruptcies an d recoveries used in the allowance calculation were projected based on qualitative factors such as current and expected consumer an d economic trends 
merchandise vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from its merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and markdown reimbursement programs 
co operative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the p eriod in which the reimbursement occurred 
all other merchandise vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchase s when received 
accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor concessions has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or selling and administrative expenses 
insurance accruals 
the company s consolidated balance sheets include liabili ties with respect to self insured workers compensation and general liability claims 
the company estimates the required liability of s uch claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical l oss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to ad justment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and change s in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
finite lived assets 
the company evaluates the fair value and future benefits of finite lived assets whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest 
the company performs an analysis of the anticipa ted undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclus ion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill annually and whenever events and cha nges in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent th ese future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of in come and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  the company s effective tax rate and ta x balances could be affected 
as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become kno wn or as circumstances change 
the company s income tax returns are periodically audited by various state and local jurisdictions 
additionally  the internal revenue service audits the company s federal income tax return annually 
t he company reserves for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the contingent amount is rea sonably estimable 
these reserves are based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions as well as various tax filing positions 
due to the complexity of these examination issues  for whic h reserves have been recorded  it may be several years before the final resolution is achieved 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the moody s aa corporate bond index 
the indices selected reflect the weighted average remain ing period of benefit payments 
the discount rate had decreased to as of january  from as of january  a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately million
