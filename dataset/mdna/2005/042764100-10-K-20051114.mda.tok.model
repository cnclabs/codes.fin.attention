executive overview arrow is a worldwide developer  manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of clinically advanced  disposable catheters  heart assist devices and related products for critical and cardiac care 
the company markets its products to physicians and hospitals through a combination of direct selling  independent distributors and group purchasing organizations 
within each hospital  marketing efforts are targeted to those physicians  including critical care specialists  cardiologists  anesthesiologists  interventional radiologists  nephrologists  emergency and trauma physicians  electrophysiologists and surgeons  most likely to use the company s products 
the company s largest geographical markets are the united states  europe and japan 
the company s revenues are generated from sales of its products  less certain related charges  discounts  returns and other allowances 
the company s costs and expenses consist of costs of goods sold  research and development expense  selling  general and administration expense  and other expenses income 
costs of goods sold consist principally of costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of the company s products 
research and development expense consists principally of expenses incurred with respect to the company s internal research  development and engineering activities to introduce new products to market and enhance its existing products  payments for third party research and development activities  and acquired in process research and development costs arising from the company s acquisition activities 
selling  general and administrative expense consists principally of costs associated with the company s marketing and sales efforts and administrative operations and commitments 
other expenses income consists principally of interest expense on the company s outstanding indebtedness  interest income and other items  such as foreign currency exchange gains and losses  which may impact the comparability of the company s results of operations between periods 
the company s ability to grow its net income largely depends upon generating increased sales of its products  particularly its higher margin products  and further improving its operating efficiency 
the company s sales growth is driven by its development and marketing of clinically advanced new products and enhancements to its existing products to increase their effectiveness  ease of use  safety and reliability  as well as to expand the clinical applications for which their use is appropriate 
the company also anticipates generating higher sales through selective acquisitions of new businesses  products and technologies that complement its existing product lines  as it has done from time to time in the past 
the company is focused on improving operating margins and sales growth by increasing the efficiency and overall capacity of its manufacturing operations while maintaining effective cost containment programs 
in this regard  in april  the company initiated a multi year capital investment plan to increase its worldwide manufacturing capacity to better meet customer demand and rationalize its production operations  the first phase of which entails the construction and acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities in the czech republic and mexico  and is ongoing 
the company is also in the process of consolidating certain of its us based manufacturing operations  improving its production technology by investing in new  state of the art manufacturing equipment and processes  and implementing enhanced good manufacturing practices and compliance procedures to achieve the highest practicable levels of product quality assurance  all as part of its project operational excellence program 
in addition  in recent years  the company has improved gross profit margins through selective acquisitions of some of its distributors and or distribution rights in key us and international markets  thereby increasing the percentage of its sales generated by its direct sales force 
the company faces substantial competition from a number of other companies in the market for catheters and related medical devices and equipment  ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger than arrow with greater financial and other resources 
in addition  in response to concern about the rising costs of health care  us hospitals and physicians are placing increasing emphasis on cost effectiveness in the selection of products to perform medical procedures 
the increased emphasis on health care cost containment has resulted in reduced growth in demand for certain of the company s products in markets in the us where arrow has or greater market shares  and protecting that market share has affected the company s pricing in some instances 
the company also continues to face pricing pressures in certain product lines in both european and japanese markets as governments strive to curtail increases in health care costs 
the company believes that its comprehensive manufacturing capability  which as described above is in the process of being expanded  enables it to expedite the development and market introduction of new products and to reduce manufacturing costs  thereby permitting it to respond more effectively to competitive pricing in an environment where its ability to increase prices is limited
