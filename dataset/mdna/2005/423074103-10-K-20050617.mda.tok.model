liquidity and financial position the following discussion of liquidity and financial position references the business measures of operating free cash flow and net debt as defined below 
these measures are utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance  and management believes these measures provide clarity in understanding the trends of the business 
management  and investors  can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short term application of cash  including the effect of capital expenditures 
the limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts the gaap measure cash flow from operations for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the company for other purposes 
management compensates for this limitation by using the gaap operating cash flow number as well 
operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight into the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows 
the company s primary measure of cash flow performance is operating free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
the following is the company s calculation of operating free cash flow for the years ended april   april  and april  amounts in millions fiscal year ended april  april  april  fy fy fy cash provided by operating activities   capital expenditures operating free cash flow  cash provided by continuing operating activities in fiscal was billion  a decrease of million from the prior year

a few of these obligations are long term and are based on minimum purchase requirements 
in the aggregate  such commitments are not at prices in excess of current markets 
due to the proprietary nature of some of the company s materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations 
the company does not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations 
the following table represents the contractual obligations of the company as of april  less than more than year years years years total long term debt      capital lease obligations      operating leases      purchase obligations      other long term liabilities recorded on the balance sheet      total      other long term liabilities primarily consist of certain specific incentive compensation arrangements and pension and postretirement benefit commitments

as a policy  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does the company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity the company s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
foreign currency risk exists by nature of the company s global operations 
the company manufactures and sells its products in a number of locations around the world  and hence foreign currency risk is diversified 
the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
these actions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures  firm commitments and forecasted transactions 
the instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
the following table presents information related to foreign currency contracts held by the company aggregate notional amount net unrealized gains losses april  april  april  april  dollars in millions purpose of hedge intercompany cash flows forecasted purchases of raw materials and finished goods and foreign currency denominated obligations forecasted sales and foreign currency denominated assets 
as of april   the company s contracts to hedge forecasted transactions mature in one year 
contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive income loss and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings 
any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense 
substantially all of the company s foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies

the company s debt obligations are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage interest rate exposure  the company utilizes interest rate swaps in order to convert fixed rate debt to floating 
these derivatives are primarily accounted for as fair value hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these derivatives  along with changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations that are attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized in current period earnings 
based on the amount of fixed rate debt converted to floating as of april   a variance of in the related interest rate would cause annual interest expense related to this debt to change by approximately million

discussion of significant accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
marketing costs trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the company s products and are critical to the support of the business 
trade promotion costs include amounts paid to retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the company s products to consumers  amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores  and amounts paid to customers for shelf space in retail stores 
accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on an estimate of the expected levels of performance of the trade promotion  which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar promotions  expectations regarding customer participation  and sales and payment trends with similar previously offered programs 
our original estimated costs of trade promotions may change in the future as a result of changes in customer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
we perform monthly and quarterly evaluations of our outstanding trade promotions  making adjustments  where appropriate  to reflect changes in our estimates 
settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the company 
as a result  the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by the company s customers for amounts they consider due to them 
final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time and could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations depending on how actual results of the programs compare to original estimates 
we offer coupons to consumers in the normal course of our business 
costs associated with this activity  which we refer to as coupon redemption costs  are accrued in the period in which the coupons are offered 
the initial estimates made for each coupon offering are based upon historical redemption experience rates for similar products or coupon amounts 
we perform subsequent estimates that compare our actual redemption rates to the original estimates 
we review the assumptions used in the valuation of the estimates and determine an appropriate accrual amount 
adjustments to our initial accrual may be required if our actual redemption rates vary from our estimated redemption rates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the average cost method 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
investments and long lived assets and property  plant and equipment investments and long lived assets are recorded at their respective cost basis on the date of acquisition 
buildings  equipment and leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of such assets 
the company reviews investments and long lived assets  including intangibles with finite useful lives  and property  plant and equipment  whenever circumstances change such that the indicated recorded value of an asset may not be recoverable or has suffered an other than temporary impairment 
factors that may affect recoverability include changes in planned use of equipment or software  the closing of facilities and changes in the underlying financial strength of investments 
the estimate of current value requires significant management judgment and requires assumptions that can include future volume trends  revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates developed in connection with the company s internal projections and annual operating plans  and in addition  external factors such as market devaluation and inflation which are developed in connection with the company s longer term strategic planning 
as each is management s best estimate on then available information  resulting estimates may differ from actual cash flows 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually  or when circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key personnel  and acts by governments and courts  may signal that an asset has become impaired 
the company s measure of impairment is based on a discounted cash flow model that requires significant judgment and requires assumptions about future volume trends  revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates developed in connection with the company s internal projections and annual operating plans  and in addition  external factors such as changes in macroeconomic trends and cost of capital developed in connection with the company s longer term strategic planning 
inherent in estimating future performance  in particular assumptions regarding external factors such as capital markets  are uncertainties beyond the company s control 
management believes that because fair values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives significantly exceed carrying value  it is unlikely that a material impairment charge would be recognized 
retirement benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  turnover rates and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
the discount rate assumptions used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income investments available in each country that the company operates a benefit plan as of the measurement date 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation for the year ending april  was reduced to from as of april  over time  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers actual real historic returns on asset classes  the investment mix of plan assets  investment manager performance and projected future returns of asset classes developed by respected consultants 
the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was for the years ended april  and april  and for the year ended april  for purposes of calculating fiscal expense  the weighted average rate of return will remain at approximately 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these elements 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
sensitivity of assumptions if we assumed a basis point change in the following assumptions  our fiscal projected benefit obligation and expense would increase decrease by the following amounts in millions basis point increase decrease pension benefits discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation discount rate used in determining net pension expense long term rate of return on assets used in determining net pension expense other benefits discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation income taxes the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes reserves when it becomes probable that a tax return position that it considers supportable may be challenged and that the company may not succeed in completely defending that challenge 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the settlement of a tax audit 
the company s annual tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes that its reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the company s annual tax rate in the year of resolution 
the company s tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet principally within accrued income taxes 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 
the american jobs creation act the ajca provides a deduction of on certain foreign earnings repatriation 
the company may elect to apply this provision in fiscal the company does not expect to be able to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provisions until after the treasury department provides additional guidance on key elements of the provision 
the company expects to complete its evaluation within a reasonable period of time after final guidance is issued 
the range of amounts that the company is currently considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax based upon our expectation of how certain technical issues will be resolved in the final guidance is between zero and million 
the ajca provides a deduction calculated as a percentage of qualified income from manufacturing in the united states 
the percentage increases from to over a year period beginning with the company s fiscal year 
in december  the fasb issued a new staff position providing for this deduction to be treated as a special deduction  as opposed to a tax rate reduction  in accordance with sfas no 
the benefit of this deduction is not expected to have a material impact on the company s effective tax rate in fiscal inflation in general  costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the company in future periods 
management believes  however  that such effects have not been material to the company during the past three years in the united states or in foreign non hyperinflationary countries 
the company operates in certain countries around the world  such as argentina  venezuela and zimbabwe  that have experienced hyperinflation 
in hyperinflationary foreign countries  the company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation  where possible  and efficiently managing its working capital levels 
the impact of inflation on both the company s financial position and results of operations is not expected to adversely affect fiscal results 
the company s financial position continues to remain strong  enabling it to meet cash requirements for operations  including anticipated additional pension plan contributions  capital expansion programs and dividends to shareholders
