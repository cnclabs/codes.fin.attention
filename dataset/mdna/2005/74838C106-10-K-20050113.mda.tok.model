item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information in the business section of this report 
overview we began our domestic operations in as a designer and manufacturer of quiksilver branded boardshorts designed for the sport of surfing 
we grew our business through the late s by expanding our quiksilver products into a full range of sportswear  and we bought our us trademark from the quiksilver brand s australian founders in the distribution of our products was primarily through surf shops 
since the early s  we have diversified and grown our business by increased sales of our quiksilver product line  the creation of new brands such as roxy  the introduction of new products  the development of our retail operations  and acquisitions 
we acquired the european quiksilver licensee in to expand geographically  we purchased quiksilver international in to gain global ownership of the quiksilver brand  and we acquired quiksilver asia pacific in december to unify our global operating platform and take advantage of available synergies in product development and sourcing  among other things 
in may  we acquired dc  a premier designer  producer and distributor of action sports inspired footwear  apparel and related accessories in the us and internationally 
we also acquired various other smaller businesses and brands 
brand building has been a key to our growth  and we have always maintained our roots in the boardriding lifestyle 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops and specialty stores that provide an outstanding retail experience for our customers 
over the last five years  our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal we design  produce and distribute clothing  accessories and related products exclusively in the consumer products industry 
we operate in three geographic segments  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
the americas segment includes revenues primarily from the us and canada 
the european segment includes revenues primarily from western europe 
the asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand  and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licenses in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services for our licensees 
revenues by segment are as follows years ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues  net we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on companies that misjudge these preferences 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  merchandisers  pattern makers  and cutting and sewing contractors 
it s this team and the heritage and current strength of our brands that has helped us remain in the forefront of design in our markets 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we can do this 
the consumer products industry is fragmented  and in order to retain and or grow our market share  we must continue to be competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  distribution methods  price  customer service  and intellectual property protection

fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total net revenues increased in fiscal to  million from million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales  new products and the dc acquisition 
revenues in the americas increased  european revenues increased  and asia pacific revenues increased 
we completed the acquisition of dc shoes  inc effective may   which marks the beginning of our third fiscal quarter 
dc shoes  inc designs  produces and distributes action sports inspired footwear  apparel and related accessories 
this new division  which operates in all three of our business segments  is referred to in this report as dc and accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue growth during the year ended october  americas revenues in our men s category  which includes the quiksilver young men s  boys  toddlers  wintersports  quiksilveredition  dc  hawk clothing and fidra divisions  increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
americas revenues in our women s category  which includes the roxy  roxy girl  teenie wahine  dc  raisins  leilani and radio fiji divisions  increased to million from million for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods are sold under the lib technologies  gnu  bent metal and roxy brands and totaled and million in fiscal and  respectively 
men s revenues in the americas increased primarily from the newly acquired dc division and to a lesser extent  the quiksilver division 
the women s increase came primarily from the roxy division and  to a lesser extent  the newly acquired dc division 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for our products in the americas 
european revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  revenues in the men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
women s revenues increased to million from million for those same periods 
the european men s revenue increase came primarily from the quiksilver young men s division and  to a lesser extent  the dc division 
the women s revenue increase primarily reflects growth in the roxy division 
revenue growth was the largest in france  the united kingdom  and spain 
for consolidated financial statement reporting  euro results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
to understand our european fiscal growth and better assess competitive performance and market share gains 
we believe it is important to look at revenues in euros as well  which is our operational currency in europe 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents asia pacific revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  asia pacific revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
the increase came primarily the roxy division and  to a lesser extent  the quiksilver and dc divisions 
for consolidated financial statement reporting  australian dollar results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but as with our european division this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
in australian dollars  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer australian dollars on average in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased basis points to in fiscal from in the previous year 
the gross profit margin in the americas increased to from  our european gross profit margin increased to from  and our asia pacific gross profit margin increased to from 
the gross margin in all areas is increasing as we generate a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores 
we earn higher gross margins on sales in company owned stores  but these higher gross margins are offset by store operating costs 
additionally  in europe and asia pacific  the gross profit margin increased due to lower production costs resulting from a stronger euro and australian dollar versus the us dollar in comparison to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal in the americas  it increased to million from million  in europe it increased to million from million  and in asia pacific it increased to million from for those same periods 
the increase among all three divisions was primarily due to additional company owned retail stores  the addition of dc effective the beginning of our third fiscal quarter  additional marketing and expenses related to increased sales volume 
as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to new company owned retail stores and increased marketing activities 
non operating expenses interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of decreased debt levels and lower interest rates in europe and in the americas 
foreign currency loss increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was caused primarily by the increasing effect of the declining value of the us dollar during fiscal compared to the euro and australian dollar 
these foreign currency losses were substantially offset by higher operating profit in our international divisions resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our fiscal profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
net income and ebitda net income in fiscal increased to million  and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased to 
ebitda increased in fiscal to million 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total net revenues increased in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales and new products 
revenues in the americas increased  and european revenues increased 
primarily because we acquired the business of our australian and japanese licensees in the first quarter of fiscal  our royalty income decreased to million from million 
instead we reported product sales in this geographic region  which totaled million in fiscal 
table of contents americas revenues in our men s category increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
americas revenues in our women s category increased to million from million for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
men s revenues in the americas increased generally across all divisions 
the women s increase came from both the roxy and raisins divisions 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts resulted in increased consumer demand for our products in the americas 
european revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  revenues in the men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
women s revenues increased to million from million for those same periods 
revenue growth was the largest in france  spain and the united kingdom 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts resulted in increased consumer demand for our products in the european market 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased basis points in fiscal the gross profit margin in the americas increased to from  while our european gross profit margin increased to from 
the asia pacific gross profit margin was 
the americas improvement occurred primarily due to an increase in our gross profit margin in the first half of fiscal because we lowered inventory levels toward the end of fiscal consequently  our end of season clearance business was down compared to the year before  and our gross margins on those sales were up 
in the second half  the americas gross profit margin was 
our european gross profit margin increased in the second half of fiscal primarily as a result of the weaker us dollar 
because a portion of our european product is purchased with us dollars  product costs in euros decrease as the us dollar decreases in value in comparison to the euro 
additionally  both the americas and european gross profit margins improved because we had a higher percentage of our sales through company owned retail stores 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal in the americas  it increased to million from million  and in europe it increased to million from million for those same periods 
the asia pacific segment added million of these expenses 
higher personnel costs and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the incremental operating costs of new company owned retail stores  and to a lesser extent additional marketing expenses 
non operating expenses interest expense decreased in fiscal additional interest on debt incurred to acquire and operate the new asia pacific segment was more than offset by lower interest rates in europe and in the americas 
foreign currency loss increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was caused primarily by the increasing effect of the declining value of the us dollar during fiscal compared to the euro and australian dollar 
these foreign currency losses were substantially offset by higher operating profit in our international divisions resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

table of contents net income and ebitda net income in fiscal increased to million  and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased to 
ebitda increased in fiscal to million 
financial position  capital resources and liquidity we finance our working capital needs and capital investments primarily with operating cash flows and bank revolving lines of credit 
multiple banks in the us  europe and australia make these lines of credit available 
term loans are used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   an increase of 
we believe that our current cash balances  cash flows and credit facilities are adequate to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  we believe that increases in our credit facilities can be obtained if needed to fund future growth 
operating cash flows we generated million from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million increase was primarily caused by an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventories  which together provided million of cash in fiscal compared to using million the year before 
in addition to this million improvement  operating cash flow also increased by million due to higher net income adjusted for noncash expenses 
increases in accounts receivable offset by changes in other working capital components also generated million of additional cash compared to the year before 
we generated million from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million decrease was primarily caused by the increase in inventories combined with the small decrease in accounts payable  which together used million of cash  a million increase in cash used compared to million of cash provided the year before 
this more than offset the million increase in cash from higher net income adjusted for noncash expenses 
changes in other working capital components also used million of additional cash compared to the year before 
capital expenditures we have avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for sewing and other processes such as washing  dyeing and embroidery 
we perform the cutting process in house in the americas to enhance control and efficiency  and we screenprint a portion of our product in house in both the americas and in europe 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  which was approximately million higher than the million we spent in fiscal in fiscal  we increased our investment in company owned retail stores and in computer systems 
investments in warehouse equipment and fixtures continued in fiscal as in the previous years 
new company owned retail stores are again part of our plans in fiscal computer hardware and software will also be added to continuously improve systems 
capital spending for these and other projects in fiscal is expected to range between million and million  depending on the pace of our retail expansion 
acquisitions effective may   we acquired dc 
the initial purchase price  excluding transaction costs  included cash of approximately million  million restricted shares of our common stock valued at million and the repayment of approximately million in funded indebtedness 
transaction costs totaled million 
of the initial purchase price  million was paid in fiscal  and million will be paid in fiscal or later based on working capital at the date of acquisition and the resolution of certain other contingencies 
additionally  the sellers are entitled to future payments ranging from zero to million if certain performance targets are achieved during the four years ending october  the amount of 
table of contents goodwill initially recorded for the transaction would increase if such contingent payments were made 
goodwill arises from synergies we believe can be achieved integrating dc s product lines and operations with the company s  and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
as of october  we have accrued million based on achieving certain sales and earnings targets  which is expected to be paid in fiscal  thereby reducing additional future payments to approximately million 
effective december   we acquired the operations of our swiss distributor  sunshine diffusion sa 
the initial purchase price was million 
the acquisition has been recorded using the purchase method of accounting and resulted in goodwill of million at the acquisition date  which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
the sellers are entitled to future payments denominated in euros ranging from zero to million if certain sales targets are achieved 
effective december   we acquired our licensees in australia and japan to unify our global operating platform and take advantage of available syngergies in product development and sourcing  among other things 
in addition to the initial purchase price  the sellers are entitled to payments denominated in australian dollars that will be paid if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved during the three years ending october  the amount of goodwill initially recorded for the transaction would increase if such contingent payments are made 
as of october   we have paid million and accrued million based on achieving targets  which is expected to be paid in fiscal  thereby reducing potential future payouts to approximately million 
debt structure a syndication of us banks finances our business in the americas and internationally  european banks finance our european business  and australian and japanese banks finance our asia pacific business 
our debt structure includes short term lines of credit and long term loans as follows october  in thousands european short term credit arrangements asia pacific short term lines of credit americas line of credit americas term loan european long term debt asia pacific long term debt deferred purchase price obligation total debt in june  we replaced our syndicated bank facility in the americas with a new syndicated revolving line of credit 
the line of credit expires june and provides for borrowings up to million 
the line of credit bears interest based on the bank s reference rate or based on libor for borrowings committed to be outstanding for days or longer 
the weighted average interest rate at october  was 
the line of credit can be accessed by some of our foreign subsidiaries and includes a million sublimit for letters of credit and a million sublimit for borrowings in certain foreign currencies 
the line of credit agreement contains restrictive covenants  the most significant of which relates to maintaining certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the payment of dividends is restricted  among other things  and our us assets  other than trademarks and other intellectual property  generally have been pledged as collateral 
we are currently in compliance with such covenants 
in europe  we have arrangements with several banks that provide approximately million for cash borrowings and approximately million for letters of credit 
these lines of credit expire in october  and we believe that the banks will continue to make these facilities available with substantially similar terms 
the amount outstanding on these lines of credit at october  was million at an average interest rate of 
in asia pacific  we have revolving lines of credit with banks that provide up to approximately million for cash borrowings and letters of credit 
these lines of credit will be reviewed by the banks in january

these line of credit commitments and agreements in the americas  europe and asia pacific allow for total maximum cash borrowings and letters of credit of million 
commitments totaling million expire in fiscal  while million expire in fiscal we had million of borrowings drawn on these lines of credit as of october   and letters of credit issued at that time totaled million 
we also have a term loan with a single bank in the americas that amounted to million on october  and is repayable in installments of million per month with a final balloon payment due in october we anticipate that these monthly payments and final balloon payment will be paid from cash and borrowings on our americas line of credit 
this term loan was established in april and is secured by the leasehold improvements at our headquarters in huntington beach  california 
the interest rate structure and restrictive covenants are substantially the same as those under the line of credit 
however  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which was valued at a loss of million at october   to fix the interest rate at per year 
this swap agreement is effective through april and is an effective hedge of the related interest rate exposure 
in europe  we also have million of long term debt with several banks  most of which is collateralized by fixed assets 
this debt bears interest at rates ranging generally from to 
principal and interest payments are required either monthly  quarterly or annually  and the loans are due at various dates through our financing activities provided million and million of cash in fiscal and respectively  as debt was increased to fund the capital expenditures and business acquisitions discussed above 
in fiscal debt was reduced  and our financing activities used million 
contractual obligations and commitments we lease certain land and buildings under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through  excluding extensions at our option  and contain various provisions for rental adjustments including  in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
we also have long term debt and obligations related to business acquisitions 
the former owners of dc are entitled to future payments up to million if certain performance targets are achieved through october  in fiscal  million is expected to be paid based on the achievement of certain sales and earnings targets and is reflected in our balance sheet at october  as a component of accrued liabilities 
additional payments to the sellers  up to an additional million  could be required for our acquisition of asia pacific if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved 
in fiscal  million was paid and million is included in our balance sheet as a component of accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid in fiscal our deferred purchase price obligation of million related to our acquisition of quiksilver international could increase based on the computed earnings of quiksilver international through june our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of october   excluding any additional payments that may be due if these acquired businesses achieve certain performance targets in the future  are summarized in the following table 
table of contents payments due by period two to four to after one three five five in thousands year years years years total operating lease obligations long term debt obligations professional athlete sponsorships certain purchase obligations excludes interest 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for interest terms 
we establish relationships with professional athletes in order to promote our products and brands 
we have entered into endorsement agreements with professional athletes in sports such as surfing  skateboarding  snowboarding  windsurfing and golf 
many of these contracts provide incentives for magazine exposure and competitive victories while wearing or using our products 
it is not possible to determine the amounts the company is required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables 
the amounts listed are the approximate amounts of minimum obligations required to be paid under these contracts 
the estimated maximum amount that could be paid under existing contracts is approximately million and would assume that all bonuses  victories  etc 
are achieved during a five year period 
the actual amounts paid under these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations 
amounts represent contractual letters of credit with maturity dates of less than one year 
in addition  the company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice 
such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item 
trade accounts receivable and inventories our trade accounts receivable were million at october  versus million the previous year  an increase of 
of those totals  receivables in the americas increased to million compared to million  european receivables increased to million from million and asia pacific receivables increased to million from million 
the americas accounts receivable increase is primarily due to the newly acquired dc division 
accounts receivable for dc s sales to foreign distributors are reflected in the americas 
european and asia pacific accounts receivable both decreased less than when measured in euros and australian dollars  respectively 
accounts receivable grew more slowly than revenues in europe and asia pacific primarily because of improved collections 
included in accounts receivable are approximately million of value added tax and goods and services tax related to foreign accounts receivable 
such taxes are not reported as net revenues and as such  must be accounted for to accurately compute days sales outstanding 
our overall average days sales outstanding decreased approximately one day at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal consolidated inventories increased to million at october  from million the year before 
inventories in the americas increased to million from million  european inventories increased to million from million  and asia pacific inventories increased to million from million 
inventories in the americas increased primarily due to the newly acquired dc division 
inventories in europe increased by approximately million as a result of the stronger euro in relation to the us dollar 
the remaining increase in european inventories is primarily a result of increased inventory at new retail locations 
asia pacific inventories increased by approximately million as a result of the stronger australian dollar in relation to the us dollar and also to support growth in our asia pacific wholesale business 
consolidated average inventory turnover was approximately at october  compared to approximately at october  
table of contents inflation inflation has been modest during the years covered by this report 
accordingly  inflation has had an insignificant impact on our sales and profits 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities and issued fin r in december  which amended fin fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated in certain circumstances by the primary beneficiary even if it lacks a controlling financial interest

the adoption of this standard will have no impact on our cash flows 
joint venture arrangement in  we formed a joint venture with glorious sun enterprises  ltd 
to pursue opportunities to develop our quiksilver business in china 
the joint venture is owned by us and owned by glorious sun 
neither partner can independently control the joint venture  and accordingly  the results of its operations are not consolidated in our financial statements 
rather  our pro rata share of the operating profits or losses are reported in our income statements as a component of operating income  and our net 
table of contents investment is included in other assets 
our investment in the joint venture has not been material to date  but additional capital contributions are anticipated as the joint venture ramps up its business and annual business plans are approved by us and glorious sun 
in  we opened four boardriders club stores  one in mainland china and three in hong kong 
we also have an additional six shops  located within larger department stores 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms range from net to net  depending on the country or whether we sell directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is computed based on estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change  and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and some european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we also have other foreign currency obligations related to our acquisition of quiksilver international and asia pacific 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
we also use other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate our exposure to currency risks 
these derivatives are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
forward looking statements certain words in this report like believes  anticipates  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify  in certain cases  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  
table of contents uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the predicted results 
such factors include  among others  the following general economic and business conditions  the acceptance in the marketplace of new products  the availability of outside contractors at prices favorable to us  the ability to source raw materials at prices favorable to us  currency fluctuations  changes in business strategy or development plans  availability of qualified personnel  changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia and other factors outlined in our previously filed public documents  copies of which may be obtained without cost from us 
given these uncertainties  investors are cautioned not to place too much weight on such statements 
we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense

foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income  and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
a loss of million was recognized related to these types of contracts during fiscal for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur in the following seventeen months 
assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of losses  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next seventeen months 
also included in accumulated other comprehensive income at october  is a million loss  net of tax  related to cash flow hedges of our long term debt  which is denominated in australian dollars and matures through fiscal  and the fair value of interest rate swaps  totaling a loss of million  net of tax  which is related to our us dollar denominated long term debt and matures through fiscal on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate certain of the derivatives as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at 
table of contents the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for quiksilver europe 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect 
in fiscal  the us dollar weakened compared to the euro and the australian dollar 
as a result  our european revenues increased in euros compared to an increase of in us dollars 
asia pacific revenues increased in australian dollars compared to an increase of in us dollars 
interest rates most of our lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor 
interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
as discussed above  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the average interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates were to increase by  our net income would be reduced by approximately million based on these fiscal levels
