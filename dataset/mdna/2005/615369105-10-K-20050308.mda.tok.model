it also publishes investor oriented credit research  including in depth research on major issuers  industry studies  special comments and credit opinion handbooks

moody s kmv develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets  credit training services and credit process software

at that time  old d b distributed to its shareholders shares of new d b stock 
new d b comprised the business of old d b s dun bradstreet operating company the d b business 
the remaining business of old d b consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the moody s business and was renamed moody s corporation 
the method by which old d b distributed to its shareholders its shares of new d b stock is hereinafter referred to as the distribution 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  moody s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such cases  the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer 
the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years 
at december  and  deferred revenue included approximately million and million  respectively  related to such deferred monitoring fees 
moody s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding  and is billed subsequently when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its reviews  moody s establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole  as considered appropriate 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above noted factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts  could result in allowances that are greater or less than moody s estimates 
in each of and  the company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis  is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may  in the future  adjust the provisions made in respect thereof 
since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material  and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved  their resolution could have a material adverse effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
in addition  potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 

table of contents for the years ended december  and  the provision for income taxes reflected charges of million and million  respectively  to increase the company s reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from the dun bradstreet corporation in october these tax matters are discussed under legacy tax matters below 
goodwill moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
moody s goodwill balance is material million at december   and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates 
in estimating future operating results and cash flows  moody s considers internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company s judgments  or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made  an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which charge could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets  liabilities and obligations that moody s reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds long term return on pension plan assets  based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments in determining such assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards  if actual results differ from the company s assumptions  such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income dollars in millions 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of assets  liabilities  obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
estimated impact on assumption used for operating income decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets 
table of contents based on our current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately million in compared with million in the expected expense increase in reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities  as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience  and assumption changes adopted as of december  stock based compensation on january   the company adopted  on a prospective basis  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

therefore  employee stock options granted on and after january  are being expensed by the company over the option vesting period  based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is calculated based on a black scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions estimated impact on amount of increase in operating income in assumption used assumption decrease increase expected dividend yield grants grants expected share price volatility and grants expected option holding period and grants years year other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated distributions from non us subsidiaries  realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody s 
operating segments prior to  the company operated in one reportable business segment ratings  which accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue 
with the april acquisition of kmv and its combination with moody s risk management services to form moody s kmv  moody s now operates in two reportable business segments moody s investors service and moody s kmv 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the 
table of contents company restated its segment information for prior periods to conform to the current presentation 
in order to provide additional information relating to moody s operating results  the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of kmv had been consummated as of january  this information is presented in a manner consistent with sfas no 
 business combinations  and is described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements

given the dominance of moody s investors service to moody s overall results  the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses  nor are they allocated to the company s business segments 
accordingly  all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody s kmv segment 
the moody s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets  credit training services and credit process software

approximately of the company s revenue was billed in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally the euro 
approximately of the company s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally the euro and the british pound 
as such  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   approximately of moody s assets were located outside the us of moody s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of million at december   approximately million was located outside the united states with million in the uk  making the company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar on assets and liabilities of non us operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity 
moody s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the united states 
by policy  the company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds  short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the company have any derivative financial instruments 
however  the company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and moody s net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million compared with contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of million  which included increases in non cash expenses of million related to stock based compensation  and million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made 
in addition  cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in exceeded the prior year by million 
partially offsetting these sources of cash in were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments 
in  the company made approximately million of income tax payments related to tax liabilities 
this includes approximately million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the company s separation from dun bradstreet  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
moody s net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million compared with the two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of million  and a year over year decrease of million in income tax payments despite an increase of million in the income tax provision 
income tax payments totaled million in compared to million in the amount included million of tax payments that were deferred from to due to the september th tragedy 
also  the amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments 
in addition to the two factors noted above  growth in deferred revenue accounted for million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in  and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional million of favorable variance 
partially offsetting these impacts  moody s investment in accounts receivable increased by million year to year 
this increase reflected continued growth in the business  significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of and an increase in days billings outstanding during 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities in each year principally consisted of capital expenditures  investments in affiliates and acquisitions most notably the acquisition of kmv 
the amount included approximately million related to investments in rating agencies in russia  korea  egypt and india 
the amount included million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the company s ownership of argentine rating agencies  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements

the increase in reflects a quarterly dividend of per share in versus per share in and future cash requirements moody s currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds 
the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the company s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements 
the company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend  which the board of directors raised from per share to per share in december on february   the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to  before giving effect to a proposed two for one stock split  payable on june  to shareholders of record as of may  if the stock split is effected  as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under dividends  then on a post split basis  the dividend will be increased to cents per share from the cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase 
the continued payment of dividends at this rate  or at all  is subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
the company currently also intends to use the majority of its remaining cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program 
however  the company exercises discretion as to when and at what price to repurchase shares 
accordingly  share repurchase activity may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and there may be periods in which the company does not repurchase shares 
in addition  the company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies 
the company may also be required to make future cash outlays  including during  to pay to new d b its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under contingencies 
in addition  management is currently evaluating refinancing alternatives for its million of notes payable outstanding  which mature in september it is possible that the company may not immediately refinance these notes when they mature  in which case their repayment would substantially reduce the company s cash balance 
these potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements  and they could cause the company to pursue additional financing 
there can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 

table of contents indebtedness at december  and  the company had outstanding million of notes payable 
the company also had in place a million bank revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the million of notes payable were secured in connection with the distribution  as that term is defined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the distribution  moody s was allocated million of debt at september  moody s funded this debt with borrowings under a million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit 
on october  the company issued million of notes payable the notes in a private placement 
the cash proceeds from the notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit 
the notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
in the event that moody s pays all or part of the notes in advance of their maturity the prepaid principal  such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess  if any  of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments  as defined in the agreement  over the prepaid principal 
management is in the process of evaluating refinancing alternatives for the notes when they mature in september at december   the notes have been classified as a current liability 
on september   moody s entered into a five year senior  unsecured revolving credit facility the facility in an aggregate principal amount of million that expires in september this facility replaced the million year facility that was scheduled to expire in september and the million day facility that expired in september interest on borrowings under the facility is payable at rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate plus a premium that can range from basis points to basis points  depending on the company s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization earnings coverage ratio  as defined in the related agreement 
at december   such premium was basis points 
the company also pays quarterly facility fees  regardless of borrowing activity under the facility 
the quarterly fees can range from basis points of the facility amount to basis points  depending on the company s earnings coverage ratio  and were basis points at december  under the facility  the company also pays a utilization fee of basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the facility exceeds of the facility 
management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities  which would result in higher financing costs 
the notes and the facility the agreements contain covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries  without the approval of the lenders  to engage in mergers  consolidations  asset sales  transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens  as defined in the related agreements 
the agreements also contain financial covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio  as defined in the related agreements  of not less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters  and an earnings coverage ratio  as defined in the related agreements  of not more than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
at december   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events  significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the agreements  all loans outstanding under the agreements including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the agreements may be terminated 
in addition  certain other events of default under the agreements would automatically result in amounts due becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  moody s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited 
table of contents purposes 
as such  moody s is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships

outlook moody s outlook for the full year is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors  including interest rates  corporate profitability and business investment spending  merger and acquisition activity  consumer spending  residential mortgage refinancing activity  securitization levels and capital markets issuance 
there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and  if actual conditions differ from these assumptions  moody s results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below 
in the us  the company expects mid single digit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year in the us structured finance market  moody s expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in from the record level of the company expects good year over year growth in several other sectors of us structured finance  including asset backed securities and credit derivatives  and flat to modest growth in asset backed commercial paper and commercial mortgage backed securities 
accordingly  for the full year moody s expects a modest decline in us structured finance revenue 
in the us corporate finance business  the company expects that modest growth in investment grade issuance and bank loan ratings  and revenue from our enhanced analysis initiative  will offset relative weakness in speculative grade bond activity  resulting in high single digit percent growth in revenue 
flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the us is expected to be offset by revenue from the enhanced analysis initiative and new rating relationships  allowing low double digit percent growth in this business in the us in moody s expects a second consecutive year of modest year to year revenue decline in us public finance 
the company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the us research business 
outside the us moody s expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of  with double digit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts 
the company s projection assumes improved corporate issuance in europe after a relatively weak  modest 
table of contents issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in europe and japan 
in addition  moody s expects continued strong growth in international research revenue 
finally  the company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the mid teens percent range at moody s kmv  reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products 
for moody s overall  the company expects high single digit percent revenue growth for the full year including the positive impact of currency translation 
moody s expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stock based compensation to be down approximately basis points in compared with this reflects slower revenue growth in than in and continued investments in expanding geographically  improving analytic processes  and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the moody s investors service business  introducing new products and improving technology 
for the company expects that year over year growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the mid teens percent range 
this expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in and the expensing of stock based compensation in and the impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of per diluted share in  compared to per diluted share in the estimated impact excludes any effects of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which will be effective as of july   and is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  moody s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately of moody s revenue in was derived from ratings  a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets 
moody s revenue growth from these sources in was lower than its growth in through as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance  and ratings of us high yield issues and bank credit facilities  was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the us and europe 
the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets 
therefore  the company s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance 
unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which moody s provides ratings services 
in addition  increases in interest rates or credit spreads  volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment  significant political or economic events  defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance  the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers  and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered 
a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on moody s business and financial results 
possible loss of market share or revenue through competition or regulation the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive 
moody s competes on the basis of a number of factors  including quality of ratings  client service  research  reputation  price  
table of contents geographic scope  range of products and technological innovation 
moody s faces increasing competition from s p  fitch  dbrs  local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry 
since moody s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us  it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets 
these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions 
currently  moody s  s p  fitch  dbrs and am best company  inc are designated as nrsros by the sec 
on june   the sec issued a concept release regarding the credit ratings industry  wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws  if so  what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use  and  if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws  what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used numerous market participants  including moody s  responded to the call for comment 
moody s response can be found on the company s website at www 
moodys 
com 
at present  moody s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec s ongoing review 
however  the elimination of the nrsro concept  retention of the nrsro concept with different regulatory oversight  or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share or revenue for moody s  or higher costs of operations 
introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive 
the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share 
competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody s 
increased pricing pressure from competitors and or customers in the credit rating  research and credit risk management markets  competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service 
moody s intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets 
however  if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors  moody s may lose market share 
possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled  experienced financial analysts and other professionals 
competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense  and moody s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives 
investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody s 
moody s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 
moody s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend  among other things  on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 
exposure to litigation related to moody s rating opinions moody s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions 
in addition  as moody s international business expands  these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 
table of contents have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 
potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated  establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings  the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected 
government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness 
in these circumstances  issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility  and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating  which may negatively affect the company 
potential for new us  foreign  state and local legislation and regulations  including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the united states and other countries  the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies  including the sec in the united states and the cesr on behalf of the european union 
it is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies 
such additional regulations could  potentially  increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency  alter the rating agencies communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process  increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings  change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate 
a description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and other countries is described above under the section entitled regulation in item  business  of this form k 
at present  moody s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the sec or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business 

table of contents multinational operations moody s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in several different countries expose moody s to a number of legal  economic and regulatory risks such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either moody s operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization  expropriation  price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of  among other things  distance  travel  cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company  any of these factors could have such an effect in the future 
contingencies from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by moody s 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters  based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate 
in other instances  because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability  if any 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material 
table of contents adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  subject to the contingencies described below 
legacy contingencies to understand the company s exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between moody s and new d b  and the relationship among new d b and its predecessors and other parties who  through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution

information resources  inc the following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in by information resources  inc iri 
as more fully described below  vnu nv  a publicly traded dutch company  and its nv subsidiaries  vnu  inc  acnielsen corporation acnielsen  ac nielsen us  inc acn us  and nielsen media research  inc nmr collectively  the vnu parties  have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit 
as a result of the indemnity obligation  moody s does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the vnu parties default on their obligations 
however  in the event of such a default  contractual commitments undertaken by moody s in connection with various corporate reorganizations since would require the company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the vnu parties 
moreover  as described below  on february   the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment against iri dismissing iri s claims with prejudice and on the merits 
in july  iri filed a complaint  subsequently amended in  in the us district court for the southern district of new york  naming as defendants the corporation then known as the dun bradstreet corporation now known as rh donnelly  rh nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation 
the amended complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws under sections and of the sherman act 
the amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship 
these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited srg 
iri alleged srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced srg to breach that agreement 
iri s antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine iri s ability to compete within the united states and foreign markets in north america  latin america  asia  europe and 
table of contents australia new zealand through a series of anti competitive practices  including unlawfully tying bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which acnielsen competed with iri  entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny iri s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data  predatory pricing  acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding iri s efforts to expand  disparaging iri to financial analysts and clients  and denying iri access to capital necessary for it to compete 
iri is seeking in excess of million  which iri also asked to be trebled 
iri has filed with the court the report of its expert who has opined that iri suffered damages of between million and million from the defendants alleged practices 
iri also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount 
on june   pursuant to a stipulation between iri and defendants  the court ordered that certain of iri s claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit  including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the srg acquisition 
the company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages 
on december   the court entered in limine order no 
 which bars iri from arguing that nielsen s pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short run average variable cost  calculated without the inclusion of nielsen s fixed operations costs 
on december   iri issued a press release  which said in relevant part  without this evidence  iri believes that little would be left of iri s case to take to trial 
iri asked the court to enter a final judgment against it  so that it could take an immediate appeal to the court of appeals for the second circuit 
defendants did not object to this request 
on february  the court entered a final judgment dismissing iri s claims with prejudice and on february   the court entered iri s notice of appeal to the second circuit 
the court of appeals for the second circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of june  in connection with the distribution  nmr then known as cognizant corporation  acnielsen and donnelley then known as the dun bradstreet corporation entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the original indemnity and joint defense agreement  pursuant to which they agreed to allocate potential liabilities that may relate to  arise out of or result from the iri lawsuit iri liabilities  and conduct a joint defense of such action 
in  acnielsen was acquired by vnu nv  which assumed acnielsen s obligations under the original indemnity and joint defense agreement 
under the terms of the distribution  old d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley then known as the dun bradstreet corporation arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities 
under the terms of the distribution  new d b undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody s for old d b s obligations to donnelley under the distribution  including for any liabilities arising under the original indemnity and joint defense agreement and arising from the iri action itself 
however  as between new d b and moody s  it was agreed that under the distribution  each of new d b and moody s will be responsible for of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of donnelley with respect to the iri action under the terms of the distribution  including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action 
on july   the vnu parties  donnelley  moody s  new d b and ims health entered into an amended and restated indemnity and joint defense agreement the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement 
pursuant to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement  any and all iri liabilities incurred by donnelley  moody s  new d b or ims health relating to a judgment even if not final or any settlement being entered into in the iri action will be jointly and severally assumed  and fully discharged  exclusively by the vnu parties 
under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement  the vnu parties have agreed to  jointly 
table of contents and severally  indemnify donnelley  moody s  new d b and ims health from and against all iri liabilities to which they become subject 
as a result  the cap on acnielsen s liability for the iri liabilities  which was provided for in the original indemnity and joint defense agreement  no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the vnu parties pursuant to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement 
in addition  the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment  then the vnu parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond 
in connection with entering into the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement  donnelley  moody s  new d b and ims health agreed to amend certain covenants of the original indemnity and joint defense agreement to provide operational flexibility for acnielsen going forward 
in addition  the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of acnielsen which  under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement  are now also applicable to acn us  which the company understand holds acnielsen s operating assets  which are designed to preserve such parties claims paying ability and protect donnelley  moody s  new d b and ims health 
among other covenants  acnielsen and acn us agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person  except indebtedness which its payment will  after a payment obligation under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement comes due  be conditioned on  and subordinated to  the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement 
vnu nv has agreed to having a process agent in new york to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement 
as described above  the vnu parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all iri liabilities 
however  because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement are based on contractual relationships  the failure of the vnu parties to fulfill their obligations under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the iri liabilities 
joint and several liability for the iri action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing  the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants 
this is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made  including the allocations described above between the vnu parties  donnelley  moody s  new d b and ims health 
accordingly  and as a result of the allocations of liability described above  in the event the vnu parties default on their obligations under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement  each of moody s and new d b will be responsible for the payment of of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by donnelley which is a defendant in the iri action  which can be as high as all the iri liabilities 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of the iri action including the appeal  or the financial condition of any of the vnu parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the company cannot estimate their ability to pay the iri liabilities pursuant to the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the iri action 
however  provided that the vnu parties fulfill their obligations under the amended indemnity and joint defense agreement  the company believes that the resolution of this matter  irrespective of the outcome of the iri action  should not materially affect moody s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements 
if  however  iri were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if moody s is required to pay  notwithstanding such contractual obligations  a portion of any significant settlement or judgment  the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

pursuant to a series of agreements  as between themselves  ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and new d b and moody s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half  of any payments for taxes  penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements excluding the matter described below as amortization expense deductions for which new d b and moody s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities  also as described in such agreements  after new d b and or moody s pays the first million  which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as utilization of capital losses 
in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have  between themselves  agreed to each be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  three specific tax matters are discussed below 
royalty expense deductions during the second quarter of  new d b received an examination report from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in in this report  the irs stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its tax returns for the years through the royalty report 
in the first quarter of  new d b received a similar examination report the second royalty report relating to the first quarter of during the second quarter of  new d b also received an examination report that had been issued by the irs to the partnership  stating the irs intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in in connection with the above transaction  and to reallocate to old d b income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for the reallocation report 
new d b also received a similar examination report the second reallocation report issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of in june  new d b and the irs conducted a mediation of these issues  at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the royalty report for and  the reallocation report  and certain tax refund claims made by old d b related to and the preliminary settlement 
the preliminary settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement 
in addition  the irs reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by old d b related to and may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in new d b disagrees with the position taken by the irs for and and plans to file a protest with the irs appeals office 
if the protest is unsuccessful new d b can either abandon its tax refund claims  or challenge the irs claim in us district court or the us court of federal claims 
moody s estimates that its exposure for the write off of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to million 
as of june   moody s had adjusted its reserves for the royalty expense deductions matter to reflect the company s estimates of probable exposure for the preliminary settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph 
in accordance with the distribution agreement  new d b was required to obtain the consent of moody s  ims health and nmr as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement  but new d b was unable to obtain consent from ims health and nmr 
accordingly  new d b and the irs were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the november st deadline imposed by the irs 
as a result  the irs withdrew the preliminary settlement 

table of contents the company believes that in accordance with the distribution agreement  ims health and nmr  by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement  would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the preliminary settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years and ims health has alleged various breaches of new d b s obligations under the distribution agreement related to new d b s management and attempted settlement of this matter 
if the parties fail to resolve their dispute  moody s understands that new d b anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr 
based on our current understanding of the positions of new d b and ims health  the company believes it is likely that new d b should prevail  but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome 
in addition  the second royalty report and the second reallocation report  which were not part of new d b s preliminary settlement with the irs  have not been resolved 
moody s estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the irs for this matter is million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
moody s has reassessed its exposure for the royalty expense deductions matter taking into consideration the original examination reports discussed above for which the company s share of the required payments to the irs could be up to million  including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits  and the potential write off of deferred tax assets for which the company s exposure could be up to million as discussed above 
based on this assessment  in  the company increased its reserve for this matter by million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure 
moody s believes that the positions taken by the irs in the royalty reports and the reallocation reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other 
while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above  moody s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both 
amortization expense deductions in april  new d b received examination reports the april examination reports from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction 
this transaction was entered into in and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old d b since these deductions could continue through in the april examination reports  the irs stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old d b on its and tax returns 
new d b disagrees with the position taken by the irs and can either accept and pay the irs assessment  challenge the assessment in us tax court  or challenge the assessment in us district court or the us court of federal claims  where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge 
irs audits of old d b s or new d b s tax returns for years subsequent to could result in the issuance of similar examination reports  in which case new d b would also have the aforementioned three courses of action 
should any such payments be made by new d b related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years  including years subsequent to the separation of moody s from new d b  then pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  moody s would have to pay to new d b its share 
in addition  should new d b discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns  moody s would be required to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
new d b had paid the discounted value of of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody s at the distribution date 
moody s estimates that the company s current potential exposure could be up to million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
this exposure could increase by approximately million to million per year  depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new d b continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns 
in the april examination reports  the irs also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its and tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction 
in addition  the irs stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to old d b certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for and new d b disagrees with the positions taken by the irs and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph 
irs audits of old d b s or new d b s tax returns for years subsequent to could result in the issuance of similar examination reports for the subsequent years 
should any such payments be made by new d b related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years  then pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  moody s would have to pay to new d b its share of new d b s payments to the irs for the period from through the distribution date 
moody s 
table of contents estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the irs could be up to million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
moody s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability 
new d b had filed protests with the irs appeals office regarding the april examination reports 
in september  the irs appeals office remanded the case to the irs examination office for further development of the issues 
new d b has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office 
moody s believes that the irs s proposed assessments of tax against old d b and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old d b are inconsistent with each other 
accordingly  while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions  moody s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both 
utilization of capital losses the irs has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by old d b during and on june   the irs  as part of its audit process  issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses 
on may   an amended tax return was filed by old d b for the and tax years  which reflected million of tax and interest due 
old d b paid the irs approximately million of this amount on may   of such payment was allocated to moody s and had previously been accrued by the company 
ims health informed old d b that it paid to the irs approximately million on may  the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing  and on september   old d b filed a petition for a refund in the us district court 
in july  new d b and the irs reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in december executed a formal settlement agreement 
new d b received the first of three final assessments on february  and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of moody s estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately million  reflecting cash payments of approximately million and the write off of deferred tax assets of approximately million 
in addition  ims health and nmr have notified new d b that they disagree with various aspects of new d b s calculation of their respective shares of the payments 
if the parties fail to resolve their dispute  moody s understands that new d b anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr 
moody s believes that new d b should prevail in its position  but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome 
in  moody s increased its reserves for this matter by million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure 
should ims health and nmr prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph  then moody s estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately million 
summary of moody s exposure to three legacy tax matters the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
in doing so  moody s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
during  the company recorded charges of approximately million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters 
the company also recorded approximately million of interest expense related to these reserves 
as a result  at december   moody s total net legacy tax reserves were million consisting of million of tax liabilities  partially offset by the expected utilization of million of deferred tax assets 
the million of expected cash payments consists of million of current liabilities reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the royalty 
table of contents expense deductions and utilization of capital losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months and million of non current liabilities 
it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows 
although moody s does not believe it is likely that the company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the irs  potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as million and could increase with time as described above 
in matters where moody s believes the irs has taken inconsistent positions  moody s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments 
however  moody s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the irs would retain such duplicative payments
