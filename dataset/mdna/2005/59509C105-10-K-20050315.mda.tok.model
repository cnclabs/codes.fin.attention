table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption business risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research  development and commercialization of novel biological products for the treatment and control of cancer 
our lead product candidate  canvaxin  is one of a new class of products being developed in the area of specific active immunotherapy  also known as therapeutic cancer vaccines  and is being developed in collaboration with serono 
canvaxin is currently being studied in two phase clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced stage melanoma 
in september  we completed our target enrollment of  patients in our phase clinical trial in patients with stage iii melanoma 
an additional patients who had consented to participate in this clinical trial prior to the time that we reached target enrollment were also enrolled  bringing the total enrollment to  patients 
we continue to enroll patients in our phase clinical trial in stage iv melanoma and as of march   patients had been enrolled in the trial 
approximately seventy of the eighty clinical trial sites that have participated in our phase clinical trials are continuing to enroll patients in the clinical trial in stage iv melanoma 
canvaxin is based on our proprietary specific active immunotherapy development platform that uses human tumor cell lines that express a broad array of tumor related antigens 
we are dependent on the success of canvaxin and we cannot be certain that it will be approved by regulatory authorities or that it will be commercialized 
if we fail to commercialize canvaxin  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
in july  we in licensed from cimab and ym biosciences three specific active immunotherapeutic product candidates targeting the egfr signaling pathway for the treatment of cancer  including one product candidate that has been evaluated in phase clinical trials 
we plan to initiate a phase clinical trial with sai egf  the most advanced of these three new product candidates  in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer in late or early  and to continue pre clinical development of the other two product candidates 
we also have a number of other product candidates in research and preclinical development  including four humanized monoclonal antibodies and several peptides that potentially target various solid tumors 
we also plan to identify and develop new product candidates based on our proprietary specific active immunotherapy  anti angiogenesis  and t oligonucleotide technologies 
our efforts to identify  develop and commercialize these product candidates  including the specific active immunotherapeutic product candidates that we have licensed from cimab  are in a very early stage and  therefore  these efforts are subject to a high risk of failure 
we were incorporated in delaware in june and have incurred net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue the development and prepare for the commercialization of our lead specific active immunotherapy product candidate  canvaxin  in advanced stage melanoma  and explore the potential for clinical testing of canvaxin in other indications  scale up and validate our manufacturing operations and improve our quality systems  advance the development of our specific active immunotherapeutic product candidates that target the egfr signaling pathway  advance our preclinical anti angiogenesis and telomere signaling t oligonucleotide product candidates into clinical development  expand our research and development programs  and 
table of contents in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our own 
we have a limited history of operations 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities as well as through equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with serono for the worldwide development and commercialization of canvaxin 
we will jointly commercialize and co promote canvaxin in the united states while serono has the exclusive right to commercialize canvaxin outside the united states 
the costs to develop and commercialize canvaxin in the united states  excluding the costs associated with the recruitment  compensation and deployment of a canvaxin salesforce  and the operating profits from the sale of canvaxin in the united states as defined in the agreement will be shared equally by us and serono 
serono is responsible for the costs of commercializing canvaxin outside the united states and will pay us royalties on net sales of canvaxin outside the united states 
we will initially supply canvaxin for commercial sale worldwide and serono will reimburse us for our costs to manufacture and distribute canvaxin for sales outside the united states 
serono may later establish a second manufacturing site primarily to source canvaxin for sales outside the united states 
serono may terminate the collaboration agreement for convenience upon days prior notice 
we manufacture canvaxin at our biologics manufacturing facility located in the los angeles  california area 
we have initiated an expansion of the production capacity at our biologics manufacturing facility which we anticipate completing in total capital expenditures associated with this expansion are estimated to be approximately million  of which million has been invested through december  we will fund a significant portion of these capital expenditures through our million bank credit facility secured in december upon completion of this expansion  we believe our biologics manufacturing facility will have sufficient capacity to satisfy anticipated commercial demand for canvaxin for several years after the initial launch 
significant delays in the completion or validation of the expanded manufacturing facility could result in an inability to meet commercial demand for canvaxin  if commercialized 
we have limited experience in manufacturing and testing biological products and may encounter problems or delays that could result in delayed development or commercialization of canvaxin and our other product candidates as well as lost revenue 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  competition from other products  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights  and with maintaining our licenses obtained from cimab 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of canvaxin for advanced stage melanoma  including costs associated with the production of canvaxin for use in these clinical trials  manufacturing process and quality systems development for canvaxin  research and preclinical development  including compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on clinical trials of canvaxin for advanced stage melanoma  the development of additional indications for canvaxin  and the development of product candidates based on our proprietary specific active immunotherapy  anti angiogenesis and t oligonucleotide technologies 
we are also developing three specific active immunotherapeutic product candidates targeting the egfr signaling pathway  including one product candidate that has been evaluated in phase clinical trials for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million associated with the research and development of canvaxin  representing over of our total research and development expenses 
included in the costs associated with the research and development of canvaxin are certain external costs of our phase clinical trials for canvaxin  including payments made to clinical sites participating in the trials and payments to third parties for data collection  management and analysis 
table of contents services  clinical trial monitoring services and clinical sample collection and storage  all of which are recognized as research and development expenses 
under our collaboration agreement with serono  the ongoing costs to develop canvaxin will be shared equally by us and serono 
while difficult to predict  we estimate that we and serono will incur at least an additional million in development costs  including internal costs  through  when we anticipate commercializing canvaxin 
any delays in the development and commercialization of canvaxin  including delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a material increase in canvaxin development costs 
if serono were to terminate the collaboration agreement prior to the commercialization of canvaxin  we would be forced to fund all of the development costs of canvaxin or seek new collaboration partners for canvaxin 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our other product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs to increase as we continue to develop new indications for our proprietary specific active immunotherapy technologies  refine our manufacturing processes and quality systems and move other product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing canvaxin through phase clinical trials for advanced stage melanoma  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an on going basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we anticipate launching canvaxin in the united states and europe in if the data from either of our two ongoing phase clinical trials is positive  if the fda and european regulatory authorities accept a positive result in one of our phase clinical trials as sufficient for marketing approval  and if our manufacturing processes and facility are approved by the fda and european regulatory authorities in connection with our marketing applications 
although the fda and european regulatory authorities typically require successful results in two phase clinical trials to support marketing approval  both agencies have  on several occasions  approved products based on a single phase clinical trial that demonstrates a high level of statistical significance and where there is an unmet need for a life threatening condition 
in the event that the fda or european regulatory authorities require the results of our phase clinical trial in patients with stage iv melanoma before accepting a marketing application or before granting approval of canvaxin  the launch of canvaxin in the united states or europe  respectively  would be delayed 
our ability to generate net cash inflows from canvaxin or any of our other development projects is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval 
in february  the independent dsmb with oversight responsibility for the phase clinical trials of canvaxin completed its review of the planned  second interim analysis of data from our clinical trial of canvaxin in stage iii melanoma 
the dsmb recommended that we continue the trial as planned 
we completed our target enrollment of  patients in our phase clinical trial in patients with stage iii melanoma in september we anticipate that the dsmb will complete its review of the planned  third interim analysis of data from our phase clinical trial of canvaxin in patients with stage iii melanoma in the third quarter of  and that the final analysis of this data will occur in mid we also expect that the dsmb will complete its review of data from the planned  second interim analysis of data from our phase clinical trial of canvaxin in patients with stage iv melanoma in the first quarter of  that the third interim analysis will be reviewed by the dsmb in early  and that the final analysis of this data will occur by mid the interim analyses of data from our phase clinical trials may only be performed after the required number of patients participating in each of these clinical trials has expired 
thus  these dates are only estimates based on our periodic analyses of the rate of patient deaths in each of 
table of contents these clinical trials  and may be delayed or accelerated if these rates change 
if clinical trials of canvaxin do not produce successful results  we will be unable to commercialize this product candidate 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to accelerate clinical trial enrollment or enroll an adequate number of patients to complete the phase clinical trial in stage iv melanoma 
in addition  we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that the medical institutions that conduct the clinical testing may devote to these phase clinical trials 
if these clinical investigators and medical institutions fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our phase clinical trial in stage iv melanoma  or fail to complete the required follow up on patients already enrolled in both phase clinical trials  we will be unable to complete this trial  which could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for canvaxin 
in addition  the interim and final analyses of the data from these clinical trials may not be performed until a specified number of patients in each of these clinical trials has expired  so a delay in enrollment will adversely impact the timely completion of these clinical trials 
we will be unable to commercialize canvaxin until the successful completion of clinical trials and regulatory approval for canvaxin is obtained 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition and valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
 revenue recognition  corrected copy  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  revenue is recognized once all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
any amounts received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
collaborative agreement revenues  representing nonrefundable amounts received for shared pre commercialization expenses  are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred  assuming that collectibility is reasonably assured and the amount is reasonably estimable 
in  collaborative agreement revenues represented serono s share of canvaxin pre commercialization expenses under the agreement  which were incurred by us after the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
nonrefundable up front license fees where we have continuing involvement through research and development collaborations or other contractual obligations are initially deferred and recognized as license fee revenue over the estimated period for which we continue to have a performance obligation 
in  license fee revenues represented the portion of the million up front license fee received from serono recognized as revenue 

table of contents as long as the milestone achieved is considered to be substantive in nature and at risk  the achievability of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and the associated services are provided at fair value  nonrefundable milestone payments are recognized as revenue when earned and collectibility is reasonably assured 
otherwise  the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated period for which we continue to have a performance obligation 
to date  we have not recognized revenues from milestone payments 
our estimates of the period over which we have an ongoing performance obligation are based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangement  the level of effort required for us to fulfill our obligation and the anticipated timing of the fulfillment of our obligation 
for example  under our collaboration agreement with serono  we are obligated to continue the development and commercialization of canvaxin in advanced stage melanoma 
accordingly  we have deferred the up front license fee received from serono and will initially recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over approximately years  which primarily represents the estimated period until regulatory approval and commercialization of canvaxin in patients with stage iv melanoma in the united states 
our estimate of the canvaxin commercialization period utilizes several assumptions  including the fda and european regulatory authorities acceptance of a positive result in one of our two ongoing phase clinical trials as sufficient for marketing approval and the approval of our manufacturing processes and facility by the fda and european regulatory authorities in connection with our marketing applications 
as our product candidates move through the clinical development and regulatory approval process  our estimates of our performance obligation period may change 
changes in our estimates of our performance obligation period will be recognized prospectively over the remaining estimated performance obligation period 
we regularly review our estimates of the period over which we have an ongoing performance obligation 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used  including property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
the determination of the undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals and estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
in february  we received notification from eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc regarding its decision to terminate its sublicense agreement with us  effective may as a result  we performed a recoverability test of the long lived assets included in our cell matrix asset group in accordance with sfas no 
the recoverability test was based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the cell matrix asset group  including the estimated timing and costs to complete the development of the anti angiogenesis technology and the estimated future cash inflows from an anticipated future collaboration with a third party and product sales 
management believes such undiscounted future cash flows are sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the cell matrix asset group and therefore the cell matrix asset group is not considered to be impaired as of december  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development will materialize as estimated 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of the recoverability of the cell matrix asset group will not result in a material charge 

table of contents goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
our goodwill has a carrying value of million at december  and resulted from our acquisition of cell matrix  inc in january we have assigned the goodwill to our cell matrix reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was recoverable 
in determining the fair value of the cell matrix reporting unit  we considered internal risk adjusted cash flow projections which utilize several key assumptions  including estimated timing and costs to complete development of the anti angiogenesis technology and estimated future cash inflows from anticipated future collaborations and projected product sales 
additionally  we reviewed the implied market capitalization of the cell matrix reporting unit  based on the number of shares issued by us in the acquisition  and third party revenue projections for other products and product candidates utilizing similar technology 
our analysis of the fair value of the cell matrix reporting unit assumes the timely and successful completion of development of the anti angiogenesis technology 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development of the anti angiogenesis technology include the risk that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and the risk that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development will materialize as estimated 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of goodwill impairment will not result in a material charge 
results of operations the following compare actual results for the applicable periods and do not reflect any pro forma adjustments for our acquisition of cell matrix in january comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to no revenues for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  consist of million of license fee revenues and million of collaborative agreement revenues from our agreement with serono 
the million up front license fee received from serono is being recognized as license fee revenue on a straight line basis over approximately years  which primarily represents the estimated period until regulatory approval and commercialization of canvaxin in patients with stage iv melanoma in the united states 
collaborative agreement revenues represent serono s share of canvaxin pre commercialization expenses under the agreement  which were incurred by us after the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in research and development expenses primarily reflects additional investment in 
table of contents personnel in the manufacturing  quality and research and development departments  increased clinical trial expenses associated with increased patient enrollment in our phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate  canvaxin  including costs associated with the production of canvaxin for use in these clinical trials  million of technology access and transfer fees under our agreements with cimab and ym biosciences  which were recognized as research and development expenses in  and payments totaling million made under our sublicense agreement with semaco  inc  which were recognized as research and development expenses 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from research and development expenses and reported under a separate caption 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects additional investment in personnel in the finance and marketing and business development departments  increased directors and officers insurance premiums and other expenses associated with our becoming a publicly traded company  increased legal fees and other expenses related to business development activities and increased expenses associated with marketing activities 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from general and administrative expenses and reported under a separate caption 
amortization of employee stock based compensation 
during the initial public offering process  we re evaluated the historical estimated fair value of our common stock considering the anticipated initial public offering price 
as a result  the exercise price of certain stock options that were previously granted to our employees and directors was deemed to be below the revised estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the option grant date 
we recorded this spread between the exercise price and the revised estimated fair value as deferred employee stock based compensation 
we amortize the deferred employee stock based compensation as a non cash charge to operations on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the options 
amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances in resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our series c preferred stock and our initial public offering of common stock in the second half of interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to lower long term debt balances in due to the full repayment in january of the notes payable that were assumed in the january acquisition of cell matrix  offset by the interest expense associated with the prepayment in full of certain equipment and tenant improvement loans in december comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in research and development expenses primarily reflects additional investment in personnel in the clinical affairs  manufacturing  quality and research and development departments  higher manufacturing expenses for our lead product candidate  canvaxin  due to the resumption of patient enrollment in our phase clinical trials and the full year effect of an increase in facility expenses due to the need for a larger facility to support our growth and the expansion of our research  analytical and clinical development capabilities 

table of contents non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from research and development expenses and reported under a separate caption 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a general increase in compensation costs 
non cash employee stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was excluded from general and administrative expenses and reported under a separate caption 
amortization of employee stock based compensation 
during the initial public offering process  we re evaluated the historical estimated fair value of our common stock considering the anticipated initial public offering price 
as a result  the exercise price of certain stock options that were previously granted to our employees and directors was deemed to be below the revised estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the option grant date 
we recorded this spread between the exercise price and the revised estimated fair value as deferred employee stock based compensation 
we amortize the deferred employee stock based compensation as a non cash charge to operations on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the options 
for the years ended december  and  amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
purchased in process research and development 
in january  we completed the acquisition of cell matrix  inc in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
upon completion of the acquisition  we recognized a million charge for the write off of the fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
the amount of the charge represents the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development programs that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the principal technology acquired related to anti angiogenic monoclonal antibodies and peptides that were in preclinical research and development 
the fair value of the in process research and development technology was based on a cost approach that attempts to estimate the cost of replicating the technology  including outside contracted services  the level of full time employees and lab supplies that would be required in the development effort  net of tax 
as of december   due to the inherent uncertainty and lengthy development life of the underlying monoclonal antibodies  we cannot estimate with any certainty the costs that will be incurred  or the anticipated completion dates  in the continued development of these monoclonal antibodies 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates during  partially offset by higher average invested balances in due to the proceeds from the sale of our series c preferred stock and our initial public offering of common stock in the second half of interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher debt balances in related to the financing of equipment and leasehold improvements in the second half of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to the use of cash to fund ongoing operations and payments on long term debt 
cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale as of december  excludes the million up front license fee received from serono in january net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in 
table of contents operating activities was primarily due to the increase in our operating expenses as we expanded our research and development activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  significant components of cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  included a million net increase in our securities available for sale portfolio  million of purchases of property and equipment and a million decrease in restricted cash 
significant components of cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  included a million net decrease in our securities available for sale portfolio  million of purchases of property and equipment and a million increase in restricted cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  significant components of cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  included the million proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to serono in december and net payments on long term debt of million 
significant components of cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  included million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock on november   million in net proceeds from the sale of our series c preferred stock in august and net payments on long term debt of million 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our research and preclinical activities  the number and scope of our research programs  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the success of the commercialization of canvaxin  the risk of product liability claims inherent in the manufacturing  testing and marketing of therapies for treating people with cancer or other diseases  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
in december  we entered into an million loan and security agreement with a financing institution 
we may draw on the credit facility at any time prior to december  and all borrowings under the credit facility must be paid in full by december  borrowings under the credit facility will initially bear interest at either a fixed or variable rate at our option 
the fixed interest rate is equal to the greater of the year us treasury note rate plus or 
the variable interest rate is equal to the greater of the bank s prime rate or 
however  we have the option to fix the interest rate on any variable rate borrowings at a rate equal to the greater of the bank s prime rate plus or prior to december  at our option  we may make interest only payments on variable rate borrowings until january   at which time principal and interest payments are due in equal monthly installments 
fixed rate borrowings are payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest from the date of the borrowing 
we have granted the bank a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding our intellectual property 
the loan and security agreement requires us to maintain a certain cash position at the end of each calendar quarter 
in the event that we breach this financial covenant  we are obligated to pledge and deliver to the bank a certificate of deposit in an amount equal to the then outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
we were in compliance with this covenant as of december  
table of contents as of december   we have borrowed million under this credit facility  of which million was used to repay the remaining unpaid borrowings under a credit facility secured in the remaining million  as well as future borrowings under the credit facility  will primarily be used to finance certain capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our biologics manufacturing facility 
the existing borrowings under this credit facility as of december  bear interest at the greater of the bank s prime rate or at december  with interest only payments due through in  we initiated an expansion of the production capacity of our biologics manufacturing facility located in the los angeles  california area  which we anticipate completing in total capital expenditures associated with this expansion are estimated to be approximately million  of which million has been invested through december  we will fund a significant portion of these capital expenditures through our million bank credit facility secured in december of the capital expenditures invested in the expansion through december   million have been funded through this credit facility 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as well as through equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
through december   we have received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in addition  through december   we have borrowed an aggregate of approximately million under certain credit facilities primarily to finance the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  of which million is our current obligation under our existing credit facilities as of december  of our existing borrowings as of december   million represent borrowings under our million bank credit facility secured in december and the remainder represent borrowings under an existing credit facility which will be repaid in full in we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue at least until the commercialization of canvaxin which is anticipated to occur in we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale as of december   the million up front license fee received from serono in january  pre commercialization cost sharing payments received from serono and additional borrowings under our million bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements until june  we may need to raise additional funds to meet future working capital and capital expenditure needs  potentially through the sale of up to million of common stock under our s shelf registration statement  declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on december   additional debt financing or through additional strategic collaboration agreements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or whether it will be available on favorable terms  or at all
