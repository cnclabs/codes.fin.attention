our offerings include design  configuration  implementation  training  product assessment  customer support  hardware  consulting services and software enhancement subscriptions 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made estimates and judgments relating to certain amounts included in the financial statements 
as a result  application of these accounting policies  could cause actual results to differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenues and revenue recognition our revenue is derived from i software and hosting fees  which consist of revenue from the licensing and hosting of software and revenue from funded research and development efforts  ii services revenue  which consist of fees from consulting  implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer 
table of contents support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and iii hardware and other revenue  which consists of sales of hardware and reimbursed project expenses 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we recognize software fees in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
although we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  the application of those guidelines requires judgment including i whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements  ii whether customizations or modifications of the software are significant  and iii whether collection of the software fee is probable 
additionally  we specifically evaluate any other elements in our license transactions  including but not limited to options to purchase additional software at a future date  extended payment terms  functionality commitments not delivered with the software and existing outstanding receivable balances in making the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
most of our software arrangements include professional services 
professional services revenues are generally accounted for separately from the software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop the most significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors and timing of payments 
we provide our professional services under services agreements on a time and material basis or based on a fixed price and or fixed time arrangement 
the revenues from our time and material based professional consulting and implementation services are recognized as the work is performed  provided that the customer has a contractual obligation to pay  the fee is non refundable and collection is probable 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
for our professional consulting services under fixed price and or fixed time arrangements  we recognize the related revenues using the percentage of completion method  with progress to completion measured by using labor costs input compared to estimated cost of completion 
revisions to the estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or if we do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time  then future consulting margins on our projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties  which are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
these products include computer equipment  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer  and revenue is recognized upon shipment by the vendor to the customer 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our top five customers in aggregate accounted for  and of total revenue for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of revenue in  or on january   a significant customer from filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the filing  the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment  we recorded an allowance of million in to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of from the significant customer  but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration 
we recorded a recovery of approximately million of the receivable in the fourth quarter of upon receiving the final cash settlement in june  subsequent to the significant customer emerging from bankruptcy  we recovered an additional  of the receivable during the second quarter of the recoveries were recorded as separate revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income and reductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets during the respective quarters 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our long lived and intangible assets and goodwill are subject to annual impairment tests  which require us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill and intangible assets had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill or intangible assets that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million and our intangible assets with definite lives balance was million  net of accumulated amortization 
income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations overview over the past several years  our primary goal has been and continues to be to expand of our position as a leading provider of supply chain execution and optimization solutions by delivering integrated  modular solutions to our customers 
with the addition and integration of new products resulting from the acquisitions completed during  and  as discussed above  along with the synchronized release of new versions of our product suite with enhanced functionality  we were able to accomplish continued revenue growth 
during  we continued to experience the effects of a weak spending environment for information technology in the united states and europe  in the form of delayed and cancelled buying decisions by customers for our software  services and hardware  deferrals by customers of service engagements previously scheduled and pressure by our customers and competitors to discount our offerings 
we believe that a deterioration in the current business climates or continued delay in capital spending within the united states and or other geographic regions in which we operate  principally the united kingdom and continental europe  could have a material adverse impact on our future operations 

table of contents in  we plan to continue to enhance our solutions  expand globally and further develop our sales and marketing  including strategic alliances and indirect sales channels 
our success could be limited by several factors  including spending on information technology  the timely release of quality new products and releases  continued market acceptance of our solutions and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 
on december   we acquired certain assets of logistics 
com  inc for a cash payment of approximately million 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  thus the results of operations reflect the incremental effect beginning january  million of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research and development 
values assigned to the acquired in process research and development iprd were determined using the income approach 
to determine the value of the iprd  we considered  among other factors  the state of development of each project  the time and costs required to complete each project  expected income and associated risks  which included the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and achieving technological feasibility and risks related to the viability of and potential changes in future target markets 
this analysis resulted in amounts assigned to iprd for projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses 
revenue year ended year ended year ended december  change december  change december  to to software and hosting fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues hardware and other percentage of total revenues recovery relating to bankrupt customer total revenue percentage is not meaningful our revenue consists of fees generated from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from professional services  customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment  which are considered non strategic 
we believe our revenue growth in the last two years is attributable to several factors  including  among others  increased sales of our expanded product suite  geographic expansion  our market leadership positions as to breadth of product offerings and financial stability and a compelling return on investment proposition for our customers 
software and hosting fees 
the increase in software and hosting fees from to was due to sales of newer products  hosting fees and funded development  relating primarily to the tms products obtained through the acquisition of logistics 
com 
sales of our solution groups other than our warehouse management solution group increased by million  or  from to  while sales of our warehouse management solution group decreased by million  or  from to the increase from to was attributable to an increase of million  or  in sales of our warehouse management solution group and an increase of million  or  for all other solution groups 
sales outside of north america also impacted the increase from to as sales increased from of total software and hosting fees in to in services revenue 
the increases in services revenue from to and to were principally due to i increases of and in and  respectively  in the number of active engagements required to implement the increased amount of software sold and to upgrade existing customers to more current versions of our offerings  and ii renewals of customer support services and software enhancement subscription agreements on a growing installed base 
revenue from software enhancement subscription agreements increased by and during and  respectively 
during the economic downturn  we have experienced some pricing pressures with regard to our services 
we believe that the pricing pressures are attributable to global macro economic conditions and competitive pressures 
our services revenue growth has been and will likely continue to be affected 
table of contents by the mix of products sold 
the individual engagements involving our newer products  including tms  rfid and tpm  typically require less implementation services  however  the number of engagements continue to grow 
hardware and other 
sales of hardware are non strategic and largely dependent upon customer specific desires 
sales of hardware decreased million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in and decreased an additional million  or  to approximately million in the decreases in hardware sales from to and to are attributable to customers desires in the current macro economic environment to buy hardware from other suppliers offering greater discounts  combined with increased sales of our optimization and transportation products  which require less hardware than our core warehouse management products 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  reimbursements for out of pocket expenses are required to be classified as revenue and are included in hardware and other revenue 
for  and  reimbursements by customers for out of pocket expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
recovery relating to bankrupt customer 
on january   a significant customer for filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the filing  the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment  we recorded an allowance of million in to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of from the significant customer  but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration 
we recorded a recovery of approximately million of the receivable in the fourth quarter of upon receiving the final cash settlement in june  subsequent to the significant customer emerging from bankruptcy  we recovered an additional  of the receivable during the second quarter of the recoveries were recorded as separate revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income and reductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets during the respective quarters

cost of software and hosting fees consists of the costs associated with software reproduction  hosting services  funded development  media  packaging and delivery  documentation and other related costs  royalties on third party software sold with or as part of our products  and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs 
the increase in cost of software fees  as a percent of software and hosting fees and in absolute dollars  in is principally attributable to the costs associated with hosting certain of our software solutions  which was approximately million in as discussed above  we did not offer hosting services during in addition  sales of our open systems products as a percentage of total revenue from all 
table of contents products sold  increased from approximately in to approximately in which resulted in higher royalties paid to third parties during the decrease in cost of software fees  as a percentage of software and hosting fees and in absolute dollars  in is attributable to lower telecommunication costs associated with hosting certain of our software solutions and lower amortization expense

cost of services consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses of employees dedicated to professional and technical services and customer support services 
the increases in cost of services from to and to were principally due to increases in salary related costs resulting from i increases of and  respectively  in the number of personnel dedicated to the delivery of professional and technical services  and ii annual compensation increases 
the decrease in the services gross margin from in and to during was attributable to the shift in the product mix to open systems  fixed price contracts  including unusually high costs associated with the implementation for one particularly challenging customer  and increased costs due to international expansion and training 
the implementation of our warehouse management open systems products is more costly than the implementation of our legacy warehouse management product  the iseries or as  due to the lower maturity level of the product and limited experience of the services personnel and integration requirements with multiple third party hardware and software products 
due to the shift towards open systems sales and less implementation services on our other products outside of warehouse management  we do not anticipate our services gross margin to return to the and levels  although some improvement is anticipated

computer software development costs are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established  after which remaining software production costs are capitalized 
we have defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which we have a detailed program design or a working model of the related product  depending upon the type of development effort 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized no research and development costs because the costs between the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions  travel and other personnel related costs of sales and marketing personnel and the costs of our marketing and alliance programs and related activities

new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the objective of this issue is to provide guidance for identifying impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the accounting provisions of eitf were effective for all reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements were effective only for annual periods ending after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on the consolidated statements of income  financial position or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will adopt statement r beginning on july  and are currently in the process of evaluating which method we will adopt 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the 
table of contents future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note pro forma net income for was  compared to reported net income of million 
pro forma net loss for and was million and million  respectively  compared to reported net income of million and million in and  respectively 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp financial accounting standard fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act that provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the fsp states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement rather than as a tax rate reduction 
also in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  addressing accounting and disclosure guidance relating to a company s repatriation program 
the additional disclosures required under this fsp are included in note  income taxes 
both fsps were effective upon issuance

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands after total non cancelable operating leases capital leases indemnifications our sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer  as well as our modification of the product so it is no longer infringing or  if it cannot be corrected  return of the product for a refund 
our sales agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death  personal injury or property damage caused by our personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the amount of award covered 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations 
we account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of december  we warrant to our customers that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for days after first use of the licensed products  but no more than months after execution of the license agreement 
additionally  we warrant to our customers that our services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services 
if necessary  we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
however  we have not incurred significant recurring expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is nominal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december
