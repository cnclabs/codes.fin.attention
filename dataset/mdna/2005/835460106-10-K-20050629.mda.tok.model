item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly and annual operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of our professional customer orders and on shipments of our oem partners  which are difficult to forecast 
because our professional customers generally order on an as needed basis and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  and because our oem partners report shipments during or after the end of the period  we do not have an order backlog that can assist us in forecasting results 
for these reasons  as well as those described under risk factors  our results of operations for any quarter or any year are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter or year 
a large portion of our quarterly professional product revenue usually is generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if oem partner shipments do not meet our forecast or if  professional revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter or year do not meet our forecast operating results can be very negatively affected 
overview we develop and market computer software related to digital media that is data  photographs  audio  and video in digital formats 
our product lines focus particularly on the two most successful optical disc based digital media formats the compact audio disc cd audio and the dvd video disc dvd video 
our software is used to accomplish a variety of tasks  including creating digital audio and video titles in the cd audio and dvd video formats and in related formats  recording data files on cd recordable or dvd recordable discs in the cd rom and dvd rom formats  editing video programs  playing dvd video discs  managing digital media on a computer s file system  editing and adjusting digital photographs  and backing up the information contained on hard discs attached to computers 
most of the products we sell include only software  though in our professional business we sometimes include plug in computer hardware with our software 
we also license the software technology underlying our tools to other companies to incorporate in products they develop 
most of the software we sell is intended for use on windows personal computers  but some of our products operate on the macintosh os  and some operate on linux as well 
we organize our business into three operating units professional products group our professional products group offers professional products including advanced dvd video creation tools intended for use by high end professional customers 
we sell a number of products in this category including dvd creator  scenarist  dvd producer  reeldvd  and dvd audio creator  all under the sonic brand name 
in addition to computer based tools  we offer content development services under the interactual brand name that enable 
table of contents professional content publishers to offer enhanced interactivity and web connectivity to dvd video end users who view dvd video discs on pcs 
our professional products and services are offered to our customers through a world wide sales force augmented with a specialized dealer network 
roxio division the roxio division offers a number of digital media software application products under the roxio brand name 
our consumer applications include backup mypc  cineplayer  dvdit  easy dvd copy  mydvd  photosuite  popcorn  recordnow  roxio easy media creator  sonic digitalmedia studio  sonic primetime  toast  videowave and others 
we sell and market these products through product bundling arrangements with oem suppliers of related products  as well as on our webstore and in retail channels both bricks and mortar and web based channels 
since we finalized our acquisition of the roxio csd in december  we have been transitioning all of our consumer applications software products to the roxio brand 
as of the date of this report  this process is not complete 
we anticipate a full transition to the roxio brand later in fiscal year advanced technology group the advanced technology group offers software and software components to pc application and consumer electronics developers 
we market much of this software under the brand name authorscript 
the advanced technology group also collaborates with our corporate strategy group in the management of our patent program  under which we develop  acquire  license and sell patents 
it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between some of the business conducted by the roxio division and some of the business conducted by the advanced technology group 
thus  for purposes of reporting financial results by business segment we group the business of the roxio division together with that of the advanced technology group under the category of consumer software 
during fiscal year  we experienced continued growth in our net revenue as well as growth in our profitability and net income 
our revenue growth for fiscal year  which amounted to an increase of from the same period in the prior year  was driven mainly by an increase in sales of our consumer products through new and existing oem licensing agreements 
the increase was attributable  at least in part  to product lines we acquired as part of the roxio csd 
international sales decreased to of our net revenue for fiscal year  down from of our net revenue for fiscal year approximately of our net revenue for fiscal year resulted from sales to dell  and our top three customers accounted for of our revenues 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  capitalized software  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 

table of contents we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain arrangements  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  hardware  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance and support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
we derive our software revenue primarily from licenses of our software products including any related hardware components  development agreements and maintenance and support 
revenue recognized from multiple element software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of elements  for example  the license to use the software products versus maintenance and support for the software product 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence specific to us 
objective evidence of fair values of all elements of an arrangement is based upon our standard pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
objective evidence of support services is generally measured by annual renewal rates 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product including hardware has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in addition  royalty revenue from certain distributors that do not meet our credit standards is recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than one year not to be fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
revenue from development agreements  whereby the development is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  is recognized over the service period based on proportional progress 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
revenue from software product sales to distributors is recognized upon product shipment to the distributors or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is probable 
our distributor arrangements provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
additionally  we permit our distributors to return products in certain circumstances  generally during periods of product transition 
end users additionally have the right to return their product within days of the purchase 
we establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
these allowances are recorded as a direct reduction of revenues and as a contra to net accounts receivable 
management applies significant judgment and relies on historical experience in establishing these allowances 
if future return patterns differ from past return patterns  due to reduced demand for our product or other factors beyond our control  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 

table of contents deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenues have not been recognized which results from the following deferred license  maintenance and support  amounts billed to certain distributors for our products not yet sold to the end user customers  amounts billed in excess of services performed to technology customers for license and development agreements  and amounts billed to certain oems for products which contain one or more undelivered elements 
unbilled receivables in connection with the roxio csd acquisition we originally recorded approximately  as unbilled receivables which represent our estimate of the oem royalty reports we expect to receive after december  for shipments prior to december  as of march   we recorded an additional amount of approximately  as unbilled receivables  which represent our estimate of the remaining oem royalty reports we expect to receive after december  for shipments prior to december  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for returns and doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances may be required 
our distributor and retail arrangements provide for certain product rotation rights and permit return of products in certain circumstances 
end users additionally have the right to return their product within days of purchase 
we maintain reserves for these estimated rights and returns 
capitalized software we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  less the estimated cost of revenue  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future cost of revenue 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
on april  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized over its estimated useful life  rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of impairment of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined in sfas no 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount exceeds fair value based on quoted 
table of contents market prices of our common stock  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we will compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
goodwill has resulted from our ravisent product business acquisition during the quarter ended june   from our dmd acquisition from veritas during the quarter ended december   from our interactual acquisition during the quarter ended march   and from our roxio csd acquisition during the quarter ended december   all of which were accounted for as a purchase 
as of march   no events have occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any impairment 
impairment of long lived assets on april   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes certain provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we do not have any long lived assets which we consider to be impaired as of march stock based compensation we account for share based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for march   and included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion of our stock based compensation plans  including the illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
the statement replaces sfas  supersedes apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the effective date of the proposed standard for public companies is for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  while the fair value method under sfas r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas regarding measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our financial statements 
for example  sfas permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
while we continue to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our financial statements  we believe that the expensing of stock based compensation will have an impact on our consolidated income statement similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas  as amended 
for example  the impact of applying sfas for fiscal year would have adjusted our diluted net income per share from to a diluted net loss of 
other disclosures foreign subsidiaries during the quarter ended june  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in japan  called sonic japan kk 
after the acquisition of the roxio csd  in japan  we combined the roxio acquired subsidiary into sonic s established subsidiary  which is now called sonic solutions kabushiki kaisha kk  and we currently

this subsidiary was established to handle the increased level of business we have encountered in japan  to potentially lower our overall tax rate  and to increase our level of direct contact with important japanese customers  particularly those oem customers utilizing our consumer software products 
during the quarter ended september   we established a wholly owned subsidiary in china  called sonic solutions shanghai china  and hired a number of engineers to work for this new subsidiary 
we established this subsidiary in response to the growing demand for our cd dvd creation technology worldwide 
this new subsidiary allows us to tap into the large pool of engineering talent in china  speeding the development and deployment of our products and technologies to our customers 
the subsidiary also brings additional reach to our operations  which include development and sales offices in north america  europe  japan and taiwan 
during the quarter ended march   we established a wholly owned us subsidiary in connection with the acquisition of interactual

in april  we combined the two japanese subsidiaries  including the operations and personnel 
other contingencies we are subject to various claims relating to products  technology  patent  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended march   and net revenue 
our net revenue increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  and increased to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of from fiscal year the increase in net revenue in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in sales of our consumer products  which increased approximately 
this increase was due to sales to new oem partners as well as to an increase in volume of sales reported by existing oem partners 
the increase in sales was also due to the full year inclusion of the results of oem licensing agreements that we assumed as part of our acquisition on the dmd business of veritas in december the increase in sales of our consumer products was offset in part by a decrease in our revenues deriving from sales of professional products of approximately 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in volume of sales reported  both from new and existing oem partners  of our consumer software products  which increased approximately 
this increase was also due to the addition of product lines acquired as part of the roxio csd acquisition  which we completed in mid december the increase in net revenue in fiscal year  was also due  in small part  to increased sales of our professional products approximately  due primarily to the acquisition of interactual in february the following table includes the breakdown of revenue by consumer and professional products for the fiscal years ended march    and in thousands years ended march  revenues consumer professional products total net revenue international sales accounted for million  or of our net revenue in fiscal year  million or of our net revenue in fiscal year and million or of our net revenue in fiscal year the percentage increase in fiscal year was due to the increase in international sales of oem and development revenue from our consumer products 
the percentage decrease in fiscal year was due to the increase in domestic sales of oem  retail and development revenue from our consumer products as well as decline in sales of our professional products to our european customers 
sales to japan accounted for  and of our net revenue for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
international sales have historically ranged from to slightly less than of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant but variable percentage of future revenue 
the following table includes the breakdown of revenue for the fiscal years ended march    and indicated by geographic location in thousands years ended march  north america export france germany united kingdom other european japan taiwan other pacific rim other international total net revenue 
table of contents cost of revenue 
cost of revenue mainly consists of third party licensing oem arrangements  employee salaries and benefits for personnel directly involved in the production of revenue generating products and amortization of acquired and internally developed software and intangible assets 
in the case of consumer software distributed in retail channels  cost of revenue also includes the cost of packaging  if any  and certain distribution costs 
our cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue decreased from of net revenue in fiscal year to in fiscal year and increased to in fiscal year the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer products  including software license and development contracts  and to the decrease in hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional products 
the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal year was primarily due to the roxio csd software acquired in mid december  which included a higher percentage of retail sales  which carry a lower margin 
we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead  they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
during fiscal year and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  and amortized approximately  and  respectively  excluding amounts capitalized and amortized relating to the daikin industries  ltd  ravisent  dmd  interactual  and the roxio csd business acquisitions 
during fiscal year and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  and amortized approximately  and  respectively  relating to technology and intangibles acquired pursuant to these acquisitions 
significant customers 
revenue from two customers  adobe and microsoft  accounted for and  respectively  of our total net revenue for the fiscal year three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our total net revenue for fiscal year dell accounted for of our total net revenue for fiscal year in each of those fiscal years  no other customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
revenue recognized from these customers was pursuant to development and licensing agreements we have with them 
the loss of any one of these customers and our inability to obtain new customers to replace the lost revenue in a timely manner would harm our sales and results of operations 
the following table shows the percentage breakdown of significant customers for the periods indicated percent of total revenue percent of total accounts receivable years ended march  march  dell hewlett packard sony adobe microsoft gross profit 
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year and decreased to for fiscal year the increase in our gross profit in fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer products and to the reduction of hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional audio and video systems 
the decrease in our gross profit in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in cost of sales associated with the product lines acquired as part of the roxio csd acquisition  which are distributed to a large extent through retail channels and which generally exhibit a lower gross margin than our historical consumer software sales 
post the roxio csd acquisition  we will derive a greater portion of our revenue from sales of software to end users via retail channels both physical and web based 
retail sales often require physical fulfillment of customer orders involving shipment of boxes  cds or dvds and manuals and thus exhibit higher costs than our traditional business 
in addition  retail channels are often quite competitive  sometimes requiring price reductions 
table of contents to maintain market share 
the combination of higher costs and possibly lower prices results in lower gross margins for retail sales than we have been accustomed to in our traditional business 
thus  you should not rely on our past margins as an indication of future results 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses mainly consist of employee salaries and benefits  travel  consulting  marketing  and other promotional expenses and dealer and employee sales commissions 
our marketing and sales expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year and to  in fiscal year marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal year  and  respectively

the increase was also due to increased marketing and advertising costs 
our marketing and sales headcount increased from at march  to at march  and increased to at march  we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will increase in fiscal year due to our including the business lines deriving from the roxio csd acquisition in our results for the full fiscal year 
we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will also continue to increase as our global marketing and sales operations continue to expand and headcount continues to increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses mainly consist of employee salaries and benefits  travel and consulting expenses incurred in the development of new products 
our research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year and to  in fiscal year our research and development expenses represented  and of net revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively

we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in the future due to our including the business lines deriving from the roxio csd acquisition in our results for the full fiscal year 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures will continue to increase in future periods as our net revenue increases 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses mainly consist of employee salaries and benefits  travel  overhead  corporate facilities expense  legal  accounting and other professional services expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year and to  in fiscal year these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal year  of net revenue in fiscal year and of net revenue in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year and primarily due to increased rent  insurance  professional and other general expenses related to the overall increase in our headcount from at march  to at march  to at march  included in this headcount increase are engineers and development personnel  sales and marketing personnel  and general and administrative personnel hired in connection with the roxio csd acquisition  which was completed in mid december the increase in fiscal year was also due to the increased expenses associated with the implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we incurred approximately  in professional services associated with the implementation of these requirements 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our operations expand 
acquired in process technology 
acquired in process technology expenses for fiscal year included the write off of the in process research and development acquired in connection with the roxio csd acquisition  which was completed in december we had identified research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future use existed 
the value for each of the projects was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and the applying a percentage of completion to the 
table of contents calculated value 
this amount represents the value of research and development efforts related to technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no future alternative use  as determined on the acquisition date 
business integration expense 
business integration expenses primarily consisted of expenses we incurred to transition the recently acquired roxio csd business into our existing operations 
these expenses include incremental costs consisting primarily of employee severance and lease exit costs totaling approximately  a portion of internal payroll costs for those employees who worked on the acquisition totaling approximately  and incremental costs incurred by consultants who worked on the acquisition and integration totaling approximately  other income and expense  net

interest income was approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
other expense in fiscal years and primarily consisted of write downs of investments in other entities  which totaled approximately  and  respectively  which was offset in part by the interest income discussed above 
interest income increased in the periods presented as a result of our increased cash balances invested 
however  we anticipate that net interest income or expense will decrease or become an expense item in future periods due to our increased borrowings 
other income and expense for fiscal year and consisted of gain and loss realized from foreign currency fluctuations 
provision for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we made no provision for federal income taxes for our fiscal year due to federal net operating loss carryforwards and other federal credits

on december  sonic solutions and roxio  inc entered into the amended purchase agreement for the roxio csd acquisition 
pursuant to the transaction  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the roxio csd  including all products  intellectual property and trademarks  as well as the roxio name 
under the terms of the amended purchase agreement  sonic paid roxio million and issued roxio  shares of sonic common stock together  the purchase price  plus an aggregate of approximately million representing certain additional amounts payable under the amended purchase agreement pursuant to working capital and channel inventory adjustment calculations 
the common stock is valued using the closing price of sonic s stock for the two days before through two days following august  in addition  the amended purchase agreement anticipates certain potential additional adjustments of the cash portion of the purchase price based on final working capital calculations  which calculations have not been finalized as of the date hereof 
on december  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with union bank of california  na uboc that provides for a three year revolving credit facility the credit facility 
total availability under the credit facility is  through the first anniversary of the loan agreement   through the second anniversary of the loan agreement and  at all times thereafter

sonic is also subject to financial covenants  which include maintenance of specified financial ratios and net profit amounts 
the credit facility is subject to customary events of default  the occurrence of which could lead to an acceleration of the company s obligations thereunder 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
if additional funds are raised through the 
table of contents issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced  shareholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue operations  develop our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases 
operating leases include our leased facilities and capital leases include leased equipment 
rent expense under operating leases was approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
on february   we signed an amendment no 
to our office lease for our novato headquarters office 
the terms of the amendment extend the term  which was originally set to expire on may   to january  in connection with the roxio software acquisition  we assumed almost all of the liabilities and obligations of the roxio csd  including a lease of approximately  square feet in a facility located in santa clara  california the santa clara lease

under the terms of the santa clara lease  we have provided a letter of credit to entrust  the sublandlord under the santa clara lease  in the amount of  issued by union bank of california under the terms of our existing revolving credit facility 
we have provided an accrual of approximately  to restore the building to its original condition  and a lease of approximately  square feet in a facility located in richmond hill  ontario the richmond hill lease

table of contents operating and capital leases includes our rent obligations on our occupied properties and includes our site restoration obligation to restore one facility back to its original state upon the term of the lease 
as of march   approximately  of the site restoration obligation had been accrued 
on december  we entered into the loan agreement  as discussed above  with uboc that provides for a three year revolving credit facility 
on december  we drew down  under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures on september  as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted securities and exchange commission rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as those in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair business operations 
the risks identified below could harm our business and cause the value of our shares to decline 
we cannot  however  estimate the likelihood that our shares may decline in value or the amount by which they may decline 
we may experience potential fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  face unpredictability of future revenue and incur losses in the future 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
we may not accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us  and  therefore  we may fail to make accurate financial forecasts 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  our products and the pcs and consumer electronics devices with which our products are bundled  introduction of new products by us and our competitors  competitive pressures that result in pricing fluctuations  variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  changes in the mix of products sold and the impact on our gross margins  delays in our receipt of and cancellation of orders forecasted by customers  our ability to enter into or renew on favorable terms our licensing and distribution agreements  the costs associated with the defense of litigation and intellectual property claims  and general economic conditions specific to the dvd audio and video recording market  as well as related pc and consumer electronics markets 
although we were profitable for fiscal years  and  we were not profitable in the third quarter of fiscal year  and you should not rely on the results for those periods during which we were profitable as an indication of future performance 
we were not profitable for the third quarter of fiscal year primarily as a result of expenses in the amount of approximately  incurred in connection with the roxio csd acquisition  including the write off of approximately  for in process research and development 
furthermore  given the general uncertainty of market trends for professional and consumer audio and video products  we may not remain cash flow positive or generate net income in fiscal year moreover  our operating expenses are based on our current expectations of our future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
we tend to book a significant portion of quarterly revenues in the last month or last weeks of a quarter  and we generally do not know until quite late in a quarter whether our sales expectations for the quarter will be met 
for example  in recent quarters  as much as of our professional sales have been procured in the last month of the quarter 
for many of our oem licenses  we recognize revenues upon receipt of a royalty report from those oems 
oem royalty reports are sometimes incomplete  or are received on an unpredictable schedule 
in some cases we determine that we need to perform additional review of reports after we receive them but prior to including them in revenues 
therefore  depending on the timing of receipt of royalty reports relative to quarterly cut offs  our reported revenues may fluctuate and  in some cases  result in negative reported operating results 
because most of our quarterly operating expenses and our inventory purchasing are committed well before quarter end  we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales  and our operating results for that particular quarter may be impacted adversely 
if we have lower revenues than we 
table of contents expect  we will not be able to quickly reduce our spending in response 
from time to time  we also may make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions that adversely affect our revenues in a given quarterly or annual period 
any shortfall in our revenues would have a direct impact on our operating results for a particular quarter and these fluctuations could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
failure to successfully integrate any business we have acquired or may acquire in the future could negatively impact our results of operations  financial condition and business 
on december  we acquired the assets of the roxio csd for million in cash and  shares of sonic common stock  plus an aggregate of approximately million representing certain purchase price adjustments 
in the acquisition  we acquired roxio s cd and dvd recording  authoring  photo and video application products and substantially all of the patents and trademarks of the roxio csd  and assumed substantially all the liabilities of the roxio csd 
two hundred and twelve former employees of the roxio csd joined sonic 
on february   we acquired all of the stock of interactual for million in cash 
in the acquisition  we acquired all of interactual s assets and liabilities  including its portfolio of patents and patent applications  the interactual player  and all engineering and service operations 
twenty three former employees of interactual joined sonic 
the integration of the roxio csd and interactual  as well as any future businesses we may acquire  into our existing business is and will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our existing operations if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
if our management is unable to minimize the potential disruption to our business during the integration process  the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized 
realizing the benefits of an acquisition will depend in part on the integration of technology  operations and personnel while maintaining adequate focus on our core businesses 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating various acquisitions  including but not limited to the following potential conflicts between business cultures  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse changes in business focus perceived by third party constituencies  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  an inability to implement uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  an inability to integrate our research and development and product development efforts  the loss or termination of key employees  including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees  disruptions among employees which may erode employee morale  undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only some time after the acquisition  and negative reactions from our resellers and customers of an acquisition 
our operating expenses may increase significantly over the near term due to the increased headcount  expanded operations and expense or changes related to an acquisition 
for example  we were not profitable for the third quarter of fiscal year primarily as a result of expenses in the amount of approximately  incurred in connection with the acquisition of the roxio csd  including the write off of approximately  for in process research and development 
to the extent that our expenses associated with an acquisition increase but our revenues do not  there are unanticipated expenses related to the integration process  
table of contents or there are significant costs associated with presently unknown liabilities  our business  operating results and financial condition will be affected adversely 
failure to minimize the numerous risks associated with the post acquisition integration strategy also may affect adversely the trading price of our common stock 
we have grown in recent years  in part due to recent acquisitions such as our roxio csd acquisition  and if our executive team is unable to effectively manage our growing company  our operating results and our ability to expand further our operations may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to effectively manage the growth of our operations 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we have significantly increased our headcount from at march  to at march  in addition  continuing expansion of our business will further increase the scope of our operations both domestically and internationally 
furthermore  as a result of our acquisitions and the establishment of foreign subsidiaries  we have increased our geographical presence domestically and internationally 
our management team faces challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over larger geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs 
our inability to manage successfully the geographically more diverse and substantially larger organization  or any significant delay in implementing appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs for the larger company  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and  as a result  on the market price of our common stock 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our operating results  business and financial condition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year approximately of our revenue was derived from revenue recognized on licensing agreements from dell  and approximately of our revenue was derived from revenue recognized on retail agreements from three national and international distributors ingram  rush order and navarre 
for the fiscal year approximately of our revenue was derived from revenue recognized on licensing agreements from dell 
for the fiscal year  revenue recognized on retail agreements from ingram  rush order and navarre was less than 
we anticipate that these relationships will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
any changes in our relationships with any of these customers  including any actual or alleged breach of the agreements by either party or the early termination of  or any other material change in  any of the agreements could seriously harm our operating results  business  and financial condition 
additionally  a decrease or interruption in any of the above mentioned businesses or their demand for our products or a delay in our development agreements with any one of them could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
also  we may not succeed in attracting new customers as many of our potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors 
to attract new customers  we may be faced with intense price competition  which may affect our gross margins 
as a result of the roxio csd acquisition  we derive a greater portion of our revenue from sales of software to end users via retail channels through our network of national and international distributors  including navarre and ingram micro 
for the full fourth fiscal quarter ended march   revenue recognized from these distributors as a percentage of revenue was significant  as discussed above 
we anticipate that revenue recognized on sales to distributors will continue to represent a significant percentage of revenue in future periods 
because we have significant international operations and a significant portion of our revenue derives from sales made to foreign customers located primarily in europe and japan  we may be subject to political  economic and other risks that could increase our operating expenses or disrupt our business 
we are dependent on sales to customers outside the united states  in particular europe and japan 
revenue derived from these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in connection with the roxio csd acquisition  we currently anticipate that we will generate additional international sales 
international sales historically represented approximately 
table of contents to slightly less than of our total sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net product sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the occurrence of any adverse international political  economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
these shortfalls could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to be harmed 
furthermore  although some of our revenue and expenses related to our international operations are transacted in us dollars  we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations and we expect to be more so exposed in the future as business practices evolve and we are forced to transact a greater portion of our business in local currencies 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
we may in the future choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
however  no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
also  as a result of recent acquisitions  particularly roxio csd  as well as our general objective to increase our international capabilities  we have a greater international presence than before 
as of march   we have major locations a location with more than employees and employ over employees outside the united states 
our management team faces the challenge of efficiently managing and integrating our international operations 
our increased international operations and dependence on foreign customers expose us to the following additional risks  among others currency movements in which the us dollar becomes significantly stronger with respect to foreign currencies  thereby reducing relative demand for our products outside the united states  currency movements in which a foreign currency in which we incur expenses related to foreign operations becomes significantly stronger with respect to the us dollar  thereby  raising our expense level for the same level of operating activity  import and export restrictions and duties  including tariffs and other barriers  foreign regulatory restrictions  for example  safety or radio emissions regulations  liquidity problems in various foreign markets  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  political and economic instability  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our shareholders equity and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our efforts to enhance our existing products and introduce new products  as well as grow our business and remain competitive  we have pursued  and we may pursue in the future  acquisitions of complementary companies  products and technologies 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed 
we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating outside businesses 
the process of integrating an acquired business may produce operating difficulties  may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties  may require a disproportionate amount of our resources and expenditures and may require significant attention of our management that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
future acquisitions may not be well received by the investment community  which may cause our stock price to fall 
further  once integrated  acquisitions may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues  profitability or productivity or otherwise perform as expected 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership could be diluted significantly 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash  or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing 

table of contents future acquisitions by us could result in the following  any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock issuance of equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders percentages of ownership  large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of the acquired companies  contractual and intellectual property disputes  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
our product prices may decline  which could harm our operating results 
the market for our software in intensely competitive 
it is likely that prices for our oem products will decline due to competitive pricing pressures from other software providers  due to competition in the pc industry and due to concentration among oem customers resulting in their having strong negotiating positions relative to us 
in addition  as a result of the roxio csd acquisition  we will derive a greater portion of our revenue from retail sales  which also are subject to significant competitive pricing pressures 
we may experience additional pricing pressures in other parts of our business 
these trends could make it more difficult for us to increase or maintain our revenue and may cause a decline in our gross and or operating profits 
our reliance on a single supplier for our manufacturing makes us vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
our hardware outsourcing manufacturing program commits responsibility for almost all of our manufacturing activities to a single supplier arrow bell electronics 
furthermore  there are other significant risks associated with outsourcing our manufacturing processes 
for example  if arrow bell electronics does not achieve the necessary product delivery schedules  yields and hardware product reliability  our customer relationships could suffer  which could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products and have a negative effect on our gross margins and results of operations 
also  outsourcing our manufacturing processes increases our exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
the occurrence of any of the above noted product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products and may adversely impact our operating results 
we are dependent on third party single source suppliers for components of some of our products and any failure by them to deliver these components could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand 
we often use components in our products that are available from only a single source 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components and we have no guaranteed supply agreements for them 
we have experienced shortages of some sole sourced components in the past 
we are likely to experience similar shortages at some point in the future 
such shortages  as well as any pricing fluctuations on these sole source components  can have a significant negative impact on our business 
any interruption in the operations of our vendors of sole source components could affect adversely our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships and expose us to potential damages that may arise from our inability to supply our customers with products 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our gross margin or operating results 

table of contents because a large portion of our net revenue is from oem customers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of their product sales 
much of our consumer revenue is derived from sales through oem customers for copies of our software bundled with their products 
temporary fluctuations in the pricing and availability of the oem customers products could impact negatively sales of our products  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  increased sales of our consumer products to oems depend in large part on consumer acceptance and purchase of dvd players  dvd recorders and other digital media devices marketed by our oem customers in pcs or on a stand alone basis 
consumer acceptance of these digital media devices depends significantly on the price and ease of use for these devices 
if alternative technology emerges or if the demand for moving  managing and storing digital content is less than expected  the growth of this market may decline  which may affect adversely sales of our consumer products to our oem customers 
in addition  some of the materials  components and or software included in the end products sold by our oem customers  who also incorporate our products  are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
supply disruptions  shortages or termination of any of these sources could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to the delay or discontinuance of orders for our products by our oem customers until those necessary materials  components or software are available for their end products 
moreover  if oem customers do not ship as many units as forecasted or if there is a general decrease in their unit sales  our net revenue will be impacted adversely and we may be less profitable than forecasted or unprofitable 
furthermore  we are dependent on reports prepared by the oem customers to determine the results of our sales of products through these oem customers 
if the oem customers prepare inaccurate or substandard sales reports  we may be required to take corrective actions  including auditing current and prior reports 
such corrective action may result in negative impact on our business or our reported results  for example  we could conclude that our prior reported net revenue and related results may be less than previously reported 
changes in requirements or business models of our oem customers may affect negatively our financial results 
oem customers can be quite demanding with respect to the features they demand in software products they bundle  quality and testing requirements  and economic demands 
because there are a relatively small number of significant oem customers  if they demand reduced prices for our products  we may not be in a position to refuse such demands  which could impact negatively our revenues and results of operations 
if particular oems demand certain product or product features that we are unable to deliver  or if they impose higher quality requirements than we are able to satisfy  our revenues and our results of operations could be affected negatively 
also  if our competitors offer our oem customers more favorable terms than we do or if our competitors are able to take advantage of their existing relationships with these oems  then these oems may not include our software with their pcs 
these oem relationships serve an important role in distributing our software to the end user and positioning the market for upgrades to our more fully featured software products 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with oems  our business will suffer 
we rely on distributors to sell our products and disruptions to these channels would affect adversely our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
as a result of the roxio csd acquisition  we will derive a greater portion of our revenue from sales of software to end users via retail channels through our network of national and international distributors 
there are currently two distributors that account for a significant portion of sales of roxio software  and we anticipate that this trend will continue as we integrate the roxio csd business into our operations 
as a result  any decrease in revenue from these distributors or the loss of one of these distributors and our inability to found a satisfactory replacement in a timely manner could affect adversely our operating results 
moreover  as we generate a greater portion of our revenue from distribution relationships  our failure to maintain favorable arrangements with our distributors may adversely impact our business 
for example  our 
table of contents distributors and the retailers who sell our software to the public also sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our distributors or retailers more favorable terms  those distributors or retailers may de emphasize  fail to recommend or decline to carry our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified distributors or retailers 
if our distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand  our sales could be impacted negatively 
further  if we reduce the prices of our products  we may have to compensate our distributors for the difference between the higher price they paid to buy their inventory and the new lower prices of our products 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of product returns from distributors through their exercise of contractual return rights 
if direct sales to customers through our own online channels increase  our distributors and retailers may suffer decreased sales as a consequence 
these changes may cause our distributors to cease distribution of our products or seek more favorable terms  either of which could seriously harm our business 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to market our products successfully 
unlicensed copying and use of our intellectual property or illegal infringements of our intellectual property rights represent losses of revenue to our company 
our products are based in large part on proprietary technology which we have sought to protect with patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
for example  we have many patents and pending applications for additional patents in the united states and in foreign countries 
we also acquired trademark protection for dvdit  mydvd  dvd creator  dvd fusion  recordnow  backup mypc  cineplayer  authorscript  reeldvd and primo sdk  among other products of ours 
in addition  we make extensive use of trade secrets that we may not be able to protect 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold 
moreover  despite our efforts  these measures only provide limited protection 
unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property 
to the extent that we use patents to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain needed patents or  if granted  the patents may be held invalid or otherwise indefensible 
patent protection throughout the world is generally established on a country by country basis 
failure to obtain patents or failure to enforce those patents that are obtained may result in a loss of revenue to us 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not develop independently similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology adequately  if there are changes in applicable laws that are adverse to our interests  or if we become involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology or relating to the intellectual property rights of others  our business could be harmed seriously because the value ascribed to our intellectual property could diminish and result in a lower stock price 
to the extent we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  competitors also may enter the market offering products identical to ours  with a negative impact on sales of our products 
other companies intellectual property rights may interfere with our current or future product development and sales 
we have never conducted a comprehensive patent search relating to the technology we use in our products 
there may be issued or pending patents owned by third parties that relate to our products 
if so  we could incur substantial costs defending against patent infringement claims or we could even be blocked from selling our products 
other companies may succeed in obtaining valid patents covering one or more of the key techniques we utilize in our products 
if so  we may be forced to obtain required licenses or implement alternative non infringing approaches 
our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  such as dvd rom  dvd video  dvd audio and mpeg video 
a number of companies and organizations hold various patents that claim to cover various 
table of contents aspects of dvd and mpeg technology 
we have entered into license agreements with certain companies and organizations relative to some of these technologies 
for instance  we have entered into license agreements with dolby licensing corporation covering dolby digital audio  with meridian audio limited covering meridian lossless packing  with mpeg la see below covering various aspects of mpeg video compression technology  and with thomson fraunhofer covering various aspects of mpeg and layer audio compression technology  among others 
such license agreements may not be sufficient to grant us all of the intellectual property rights necessary to market our products 
we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 
we face risks associated with our patent position  including the potential need to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents  the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied  the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents and the possibility that our products may infringe patent rights of third parties 
budgetary concerns may cause us not to file  or continue  litigation against known infringers of our patent rights 
failure to reliably enforce our patent rights against infringers may make licensing more difficult 
third parties could pursue us claiming that our products infringe various patents 
for example  a group of companies have formed an organization called mpeg la to enforce the rights of holders of patents covering aspects of mpeg video technology 
although we have entered into an agreement with mpeg la  that agreement may not prevent third parties not represented by mpeg la from asserting that we infringe a patent covering some aspects of mpeg technology 
additionally  in connection with the roxio csd acquisition  we assumed a number of patent infringement suits involving roxio for which we have potential liability 
for example  optima technology corporation filed a lawsuit against us alleging infringement of certain of their patents by roxio s easy cd creator line of products 
in april  roxio and mgi were notified by a number of companies that certain of roxio and mgi s software products may infringe patents owned by those companies 
furthermore  electronics for imaging and massachusetts institute of technology filed action against companies  including roxio and mgi  claiming patent infringement 
these patent infringement suits are discussed in greater detail under the caption current infringement issues in item above 
patent infringement litigation can be time consuming and costly  may divert management resources and may result in the invalidation of our intellectual property rights 
if such litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for us  we could be subject to substantial damage claims and required to cease production of infringing products  terminate our use of infringing technology or develop non infringing technology and obtain a royalty or license agreement to continue using the technology at issue 
such royalty or license agreements might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  resulting in serious harm to our business 
our use of protected technology may result in liability that threatens our continuing operation 
we may be liable to some of our customers for damages that they incur in connection with intellectual property claims 
although we attempt to limit our exposure to liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property rights in our license agreements with customers  we may not succeed 
if we are required to pay damages to our customers  or indemnify our customers for damages they incur  our business could be harmed 
moreover  even if a particular claim falls outside of our indemnity or warranty obligations to our customers  our customers may be entitled to additional contractual remedies against us 
furthermore  even if we are not liable to our customers  our customers may attempt to pass on to us the cost of any license fees or damages owed to third parties by reducing the amounts they pay for our products 
these price reductions could harm our business 

table of contents some of our competitors possess greater technological and financial resources than we do  may produce better or more cost effective products than ours and may be more effective than we are in marketing and promoting their products 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products  or will be better equipped than we are to promote products in the marketplace 
a number of companies have announced or are delivering products which compete with our products 
these include apple computer  arcsoft  cyberlink  intervideo  inc  mediostream  nero  pinnacle the acquisition of pinnacle by avid technology has been announced and is currently pending and ulead intervideo recently announced that it has acquired a controlling interest in ulead 
some of these companies have greater financial and technological resources than we do 
because our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  to the extent that we cannot distinguish our products from those produced by our competitors  our current distributors and customers may choose alternate producers or choose to purchase products from multiple vendors 
we may be unable to compete effectively with the other vendors if we cannot produce products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
we cannot provide any assurance that the industry standards on which we develop new products will allow us to compete effectively with companies possessing greater financial and technological resources than we have to market  promote and exploit sales opportunities as they arise in the future 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require significant expenditures for research and development that could affect adversely our operating results 
further  any new products we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner or in advance of our competitor s products and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
revenue derived from our professional products and services have declined in recent years and may continue to decline 
we have recently experienced revenue declines in the professional segment and  absent new format introductions  such as the proposed high definition video optical disc formats  we expect such declines to continue 
professional dvd facilities began equipping to prepare dvd titles as early as  and significant expansion of dvd creation capacity occurred during  and although the number of dvd discs replicated will continue to grow in future years  we do not expect that the number of titles published will expand as dramatically  hence we do not expect that dvd production facilities will increase the rate of their capacity expansion 
instead  they may decrease the rate of their expansion resulting in a lower level of sales for us 
we may encounter significant challenges as our business comes to depend more on sales of consumer products 
we anticipate that our business will continue to evolve to depend more on sales of consumer products to generate additional revenue and grow our business 
if this trend continues  we will be subject to risks due to changing consumer demands  extensive competition which may result in price erosions  products liability litigation and product warranty concerns 
as our consumer segment grows  our business may become more seasonal 
the general pattern associated with consumer products that we develop is one of higher sales and revenue during the winter holiday season 
due to the importance of the winter holiday selling season  we may expect that the corresponding fiscal quarter will contribute a greater proportion of our sales and gross profit for an entire year 
if  for any reason  our sales or sales of our oem customers fall below our expectations in november and december for example  if specific events cause consumer confidence to drop or other factors limit consumer spending  our business  financial condition and annual operating results may be materially adversely affected 
success in our consumer segment will depend upon our ability to enhance and distinguish our existing products  to introduce new competitive products with features that meet changing consumer requirements  and to control our inventory levels to avoid any significant impact from sudden price decreases 

table of contents moreover  our success will depend on our ability to sell effectively our products in the consumer market 
historically  the major portion of sales of our consumer products were through bundling arrangements with our oem customers 
however  as we have increased our sales of consumer software  we have increasingly relied on sales of our software through direct sonic webstore channels  as well as retail both physical and web based channels 
we may not have the capital required or the necessary personnel or expertise to develop and enhance these distribution channels 
if we do spend the capital required to develop these distribution channels  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful or profitable 
moreover  some of these other revenue opportunities are more fragmented than the oem market and will take more time and effort to penetrate 
also  some of our competitors have well established retail distribution capabilities and existing brands with market acceptance that provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
if we are not successful in overcoming any of these challenges our business and results of operations may be harmed 
we may need to develop additional channels to market and sell our professional products  which may not occur 
we rely on dealers for the vast majority of sales for our professional products 
recruiting and maintaining dealers can pose significant challenges 
because our products are sophisticated  our dealers need to be technically proficient and very familiar with our products 
we may fail to attract the dealers necessary to expand our sales and business reversals or turnovers at dealer organizations may have a negative impact on our sales 
moreover  the attractive dealers in a targeted region may carry competing products 
if our competitors offer our dealers more favorable terms  our dealers may de emphasize or decline to carry our products 
our revolving credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions 
our revolving credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions will limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  make investments  sell assets  incur certain liens  or merge or consolidate with other businesses 
in addition  our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
we cannot assure you that these covenants will not hinder our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 
currently  the borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
further  we may require additional capital in the future to expand our business operations  acquire complementary businesses or replenish cash expended sooner than anticipated 
our current revolving credit facility may restrict us from obtaining additional capital or such additional capital may not otherwise be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product lives 
the pursuit of necessary technological advances and the development of new products require substantial time and expense 
to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate  we must develop and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
for example  our business involves new digital audio and video formats  such as dvd video and dvd audio  and  more recently  the new recordable dvd formats including dvd ram  dvd r rw  and dvd rw 
currently  there is extensive activity in our industry targeting the introduction of new  high definition  formats including hd dvd and blu ray disc 
we expend significant time and effort to develop new products in compliance with these new formats 
if these formats prove to be unsuccessful or are not accepted for any reason  there will be limited demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that the products we are currently developing or intend to develop will achieve feasibility or that even 
table of contents if we are successful  the developed product will be accepted by the market 
we may not be able to recover the costs of existing and future product developments and our failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our reliance on outsourcing our web store makes us vulnerable to third parties operational problems 
we have initiated a web based retail store for our consumer products including dvdit and mydvd  as well as some of our professional products  for example  reeldvd 
we currently outsource our web store targeted at the us market through an arrangement we have with digital river  targeted at the european market through an arrangement with element which has been acquired by digital river and targeted at the japanese market through an arrangement with sanshin 
we may have other similar arrangements in the future 
we refer to digital river and such other organizations as outsourcers 
under these arrangements the outsourcers provide the servers which list our products and handle all purchase transactions through their secure web sites 
we are dependent on the outsourcers for smooth operation of our web store 
since our web store sales constitute a significant portion of our revenue  any interruption of digital river s or any other outsourcer s service to us could have a negative effect on our business 
if digital river or other outsourcers were to withdraw from this business  or change its terms of service in ways that were not feasible for us  there might not be a ready alternative outsourcing organization available to us  and we might be unprepared to assume operation of the web store ourselves 
if any of these events occurs  our results of operations would be harmed 
undetected errors or failures found in our products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our reputation and business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us  errors may not be found in new products until after delivery to our customers 
we may need to modify significantly our products to correct these errors 
our reputation and business could be damaged if undetected errors cause our user and customer base to reject our new products 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and because there is significant competition for personnel in our industry  we may not be able to attract and retain such qualified personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team  and our technical  marketing  sales  and customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of significant numbers of such personnel could harm significantly our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have any life insurance or other insurance covering the loss of any of our key employees 
because our products are specialized and complex  our success depends upon our ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  including qualified technical  marketing and sales personnel 
however  the competition for personnel is intense and we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel 
our stock price has been volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and could decline substantially 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons future announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  charges  amortization and other financial effects relating to our recent or future acquisitions  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisition or loss of significant customers  distributors or suppliers  business acquisitions or divestitures  
table of contents changes in earnings estimates by us or by independent analysts who cover the company  issuances of stock under our current or any future shelf registration statement  fluctuations in the us or world economy or general market conditions  the delay in delivery to market or acceptance of new dvd products  such as dvd recorders  or disclosure of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures or of other corporate governance issues 
in addition  stock markets in general  and the market for technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years which frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market fluctuations may impact adversely the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
in the past  shareholders of various companies often have instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a shareholder files a securities class action suit against us  we would incur substantial legal fees and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
compliance with changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted  and will continue to result  in the incurrence of additional expenses associated with being a public company 
new and changing laws and regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  impose stricter corporate governance requirements  greater disclosure obligations  and greater focus on disclosure and internal controls 
these new laws and regulations have had the effect of increasing the complexity and cost of our company s corporate governance compliance  diverting the time and attention of our management from revenue generating activities to compliance activities  and increasing the risk of personal liability for our board members and executive officers involved in our corporate governance process 
our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations have resulted  and will continue to result  in increased general and administrative expenses  and increased professional and independent auditor fees 
in addition  it has become more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
in order to meet the new corporate governance and financial disclosure obligations  we have been taking  and will continue to take  steps to improve our controls and procedures  including disclosure and internal controls  and related corporate governance policies and procedures to address compliance issues and correct any deficiencies that we may discover 
for example  pursuant to the requirements of section of sarbanes oxley  we have undertaken a comprehensive and costly evaluation of our internal controls 
based on this evaluation and as set forth in the section management report included in this annual report  our management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as measured by the applicable standards 
our management further determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as measured by the applicable standards 
in response to these deficiencies  our management has commenced the necessary processes and procedures to remediate the deficiencies in our disclosure and internal control by establishing  implementing and testing additional controls 
however  we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure that we design  implement  and maintain adequate disclosure and internal controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or will be sufficient to address and eliminate in a timely manner the material weaknesses discussed in item a of this annual report 
any delay or failure to design and implement new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation  could harm our operating results  cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations  or prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud 
disclosure of our material weaknesses  any failure to remediate such material weaknesses in a timely fashion or having or maintaining ineffective disclosure and internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

table of contents our efforts to correct the deficiencies in our disclosure and internal controls have required  and will continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  we anticipate the costs associated with the testing and evaluation of our internal controls will be significant and material in fiscal year and may continue to be material in future fiscal years as these controls are maintained and continually evaluated and tested 
furthermore  changes in our operations and the growth of our business following our recent acquisitions of interactual and the roxio csd have required us to modify and expand our disclosure controls and procedures  internal controls and related corporate governance policies 
any future acquisitions and other changes in our operations likely will require us to revise further our disclosure controls and procedures  internal controls and related corporate governance policies 
in addition  the new and changed laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws and regulations differ from the conduct intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities or varying interpretations of the law  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions  our reputation may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected 
newly adopted accounting regulations that require companies to expense stock options will result in a decrease in our earnings and our stock price may decline 
the fasb recently adopted the previously proposed regulations that will eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that we currently use and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the effective date of the proposed standard for public companies is for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  currently  we generally only disclose such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the adoption of this new accounting regulation will have a significant impact on our results of operations as our reported earnings will decrease significantly 
our stock price could decline in response to the perceived decline in our reported earnings 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  labor issues and other unexpected events 
our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities  are located in california  an area known for seismic activity 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business 
our business also may be impacted by labor issues related to our operations and or those of our suppliers  distributors or customers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
we are not likely to have sufficient insurance to compensate for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events
