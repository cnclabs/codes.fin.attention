restatement of results in connection with the acquisition of the minority interest of tti during fiscal  we discovered that we had previously understated the gain on the original sale of tti securities to a third party by approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal which ended september  this error related to the incorrect determination of the net carrying value of our investment in tti at the time of disposal and the corresponding impact on the gain from the disposal 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  have been restated  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in addition  the results of operations for the year ended june  discussed within item of this form k have been updated to reflect the restatement 
overview of business we design  develop and market integrated circuits for digital media applications  such as digital television  liquid crystal display lcd television and digital set top boxes 
our system on chip semiconductors provide the intelligence for these new types of displays by processing and optimizing video and computer graphic signals to produce high quality and realistic images 
many of the world s leading manufacturers of consumer electronics and computer display products utilize our technology to enhance image quality and ease of use of their products 
our goal is to provide the best image quality enhanced digital media integrated circuits at competitive prices to users 
we sell our products primarily to digital television original equipment manufacturers in china  korea  taiwan and japan 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of customers 
our top three customers accounted for of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  substantially all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
our products are manufactured primarily by united microelectronics corporation umc  a semiconductor manufacturer located in taiwan 

table of contents we operate primarily through subsidiaries and offices located in california  taiwan and china 
trident microsystems  inc tmi  located in sunnyvale  california  acts as an administrative home office  operating through our owned subsidiary  trident technology  inc tti  located in taipei  taiwan  tti s us branch located in sunnyvale  california and our owned subsidiary  trident multimedia technologies shanghai co  ltd 
tmt  located in shanghai  china 
our net income is determined after taking a charge for the share of income relating to the minority interest in tti 
through the first quarter of fiscal  we took various steps to prepare for an offering of shares in our consolidated subsidiary  tti  in the taiwanese stock market 
we believed that such an offering would be in the interests of trident s shareholders for a number of reasons 
while no decision had been made to proceed with an offering  as part of the process in taiwan to prepare for a potential offering  we sold  shares of tti for a gain of  in the first quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal we disclosed the increased likelihood of a public offering by tti 
shareholders and analysts raised a number of concerns about the potential transaction including dilution of earnings that might result from such an offering 
in response to these concerns  trident management developed a new strategy to instead acquire the minority interest in tti 
under a plan of acquisition approved by our board of directors and stockholders  we acquired substantially all of the tti minority interests in exchange for trident common stock at the rate of one share of trident common stock for five shares of tti stock and assumed all outstanding tti stock options at the same exchange ratio 
during this period we also acquired certain of the tti minority interests for cash 
in total  during fiscal  million shares of tmi common stock  million of cash and options to acquire million shares of trident common stock were exchanged for the minority interest in tti 
references to we  trident  or the company in this report refer to trident microsystems  inc and its subsidiaries  including tti which is owned by tmi as of june   and was owned by tmi as of june  
table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
accordingly  revenue is recognized generally upon shipment  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
sales to resellers  which may eventually be subject to requests for return or price protection  are deferred and recognized when any such rights or expectations expire upon sale and shipment to the end user customers 
approximately and of revenues in the years ended june  and  respectively  were recognized upon sales through distributors 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions  historical returns  inventory levels at distributors and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb no 
 compensation cost is generally recognized based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of our stock on the date of grant and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
before the acquisition of the minority interest in our tti subsidiary  we established the fair market value of non public stock in our then majority owned tti subsidiary 
we relied in part on valuations implied from fairness opinions received in connection with tti related transactions on investment banking valuations at different points in time  the prices of occasional rd party transactions in tti stock and interpolations between these data points to estimate fair market value of the non public stock at the date of grant of any options in these securities to employees 
we made these interpolations and estimates in good faith  recognizing that establishing a fair value is difficult and requires an appropriate degree of judgment and experience in the absence of an independent liquid market to establish fair value in any given security 
the fairness opinions and third party valuations were in part relied upon valuation metrics of comparable publicly traded securities in taiwan 
these metrics change constantly and reflect the relative high 
table of contents volatility of these securities 
in general management believes that there is also a high correlation between the value of tti common stock and the us market based characteristics such as volatility of the tmi or parent company stock 
this correlation was also factored into the valuation of tti stock for the purposes of measuring compensation expense 
as these characteristics and factors can vary over time  we used an average over a period of time to minimize potential distortion of the measurement at any one point in time 
as of march   our board of directors approved the exchange of tti options for tmi options on a ratio of respectively as approved by the shareholders at the annual meeting held march  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical trends 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated principally at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of cost first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets 
we currently evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as developed technologies  are amortized to expense over time 
we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process r d  which is immediately expensed in the period the acquisition is completed 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we will engage an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this type of analysis 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to long lived assets  factors  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period 
table of contents of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas generally within our strategic focus  one of which is publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
litigation and other contingencies 
we account for litigation and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual losses from loss contingencies or restructuring liabilities are significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be materially affected 
we have been required to make such adjustments to these types of estimates in the past 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages that consolidated statement of operations items are to revenues for the years ended june   and year ended june  restated revenues cost of revenues cost of revenues amortization of intangible assets gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in process research and development income loss from operations gain loss on investments  net interest and other income expense  net minority interests in subsidiaries gain loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss the following table provides statement of operations data and the percentage change from the prior year in thousands year ended june  year ended june  change change revenues cost of revenues cost of revenues amortization of intangibles gross profit research and development expenses sales  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles in process research and development income loss from operations revenues total revenues in fiscal increased to million from million reported in fiscal sales of digital media products represented approximately million or of total revenues in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal the increase in sales of digitally processed television products in fiscal was primarily due to continued success of our svp and mv products largely in the digital process television markets 
the volume of digital media units sold increased by more than  however the average selling price declined by approximately 

table of contents total revenues in fiscal were million  which is slightly lower than the million reported in fiscal sales of digital media products represented approximately million or of total revenues in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal the increase in sales of digitally processed television products in fiscal was primarily attributed to continued success of the d and mv products largely in digital crt markets as well as a favorable reception from new customers for our svp and lcd panel based products 
in fiscal the volume of digital media units increased by more than  however as is typical in consumer electronics markets  the average selling price eroded by an amount in the range of 
the aggregate average selling price in fiscal was in a range of per unit 
no revenue was recorded for graphics products in the year ended june  as a result of the transfer of the graphics division to xgi in july sales to asian customers  primarily in china  japan  korea and taiwan accounted for of our revenues in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in china  korea and taiwan accounted for of our revenues in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in japan  taiwan and china accounted for of revenues in fiscal in the year ended june   three customers sony  skyworth and samsung each accounted for more than of total revenues 
in the year ended june   three customers skyworth  konka and samsung each accounted for more than of total revenues 
in the year ended june   two customers toshiba and skyworth each accounted for more than of total revenues 
substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all periods 
approximately of sales in fiscal went through distributors  compared to approximately of sales in fiscal gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of the amortization of intangible assets in cost of sales as result of the acquisition of the minority interest in our tti subsidiary without which gross margin would have remained essentially unchanged 
the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a relative increase in sales of digital media products which have higher margins than pc graphics products 
our strategy is to maintain or improve gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins  and reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yield and utilizing newer process technology 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and from million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses  both in actual dollars and as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of additional personnel approximately million  facilities expenses approximately million  expenditures relating to the release of design data bases to foundry approximately million and deferred compensation expense related to the acquisition of our minority interest in tti of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses to million in fiscal from million in fiscal was primarily the result of decreased spending on research and development relating to graphics products 
we plan to continue developing the next generation dptv product as well as other advanced products for digital tv and digital set top boxes stb for the digital television market in china  japan  korea and taiwan

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to deferred compensation expense related to the acquisition of our minority interest in tti of million  offset by a one time reversal of approximately million in legal fees accrued for neomagic s claims against us  which were finally settled in august selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal due to an increase in professional fees and an increase in administrative expenses relating to our restructuring activities 
in process research and development expenses in connection with our acquisition of the minority interest in the equity interests in tti  in fiscal we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the amounts allocated to the acquired ipr d were immediately expensed in the period that the acquisition was completed because the projects associated with the acquired ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and no future alternative uses existed for the technology 
the calculation of the amount allocated to acquired ipr d was determined using management s estimates after consultation with an independent appraiser and was determined using a discounted cash flow method and factors including projected financial results  relative risk of successful development  time value of money and level of completion 
we expect that the in process technologies will be successfully completed by the december quarter of calendar with approximately million in remaining costs 
at the time of acquisition  trident had four material development projects in process as follows lx px cx next generation dptv video processing products 
tafe trident analog front end companion chip to hidtv deployment hidtv pro nd generation integrated video processing and hd mpeg decode 
hidtv st generation integrated video processing and hd mpeg decode as of june   we continued to expect the above projects to be completed by the end of december the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition 
revenues for the incremental core technologies developed are expected to commence in the second quarter of fiscal and extend through revenue projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions 
interest and other income expense  net net interest and other expense of  in fiscal was comprised primarily of interest income of  which was due to higher cash balances during fiscal compared to  favorable currency exchange gains of  and other expenses of  net interest and other expense of  in fiscal  was comprised of an expense of  primarily due to currency exchange losses and investment expenses  partially offset by interest income of  net interest and other expense was  in fiscal representing an expense of  partially offset by interest income of  interest income declined in fiscal due to lower applicable interest rates as compared to fiscal the amount of interest income we earn varies directly with the amount of our cash and cash equivalents balances and prevailing interest rates 

table of contents minority interests in subsidiaries minority interests in subsidiaries decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in minority interest in fiscal was primarily due to our acquisition of the minority interest in our tti subsidiary  which we acquired in fiscal we own approximately of the equity interests of our tti subsidiary  as of june  minority interests represent the share of income relating to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries 
the minority interests remaining in our tti subsidiary is and no significant minority interest charge will be incurred in future periods 
provision benefit for income taxes a provision for income taxes of million was recorded for the fiscal year ended june  which was primarily the result of foreign income taxes on our taiwan operations 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded for the fiscal year ended june  of which million related to our operations in taiwan 
for fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of million to increase our valuation allowance and reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset to zero 
based on our assessment of all available evidence  including consideration of historical and future estimated taxable losses  we concluded that it was more likely than not our net deferred tax asset would not be realized 
the net deferred tax asset arose during fiscal due to decreases in our deferred tax liabilities associated with cumulative unrealized holding gains on our umc investment 
investment in umc and other investments as of june   we owned approximately million shares of united microelectronics corporation umc which represented approximately of the outstanding stock of umc at that time 
the million shares of umc is up from the million we owned as of june  due to a stock dividend of umc shares issued during the quarter ended september  during fiscal year the company sold million shares of its investment in umc for cash of million 
this resulted in a gain of million 
we have sold in the past and may sell additional umc shares in the near future if we determine that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to do so 
see part ii  item  notes and above investment in umc and comprehensive income loss  respectively for discussion of this investment
