item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative drugs 
we specialize in developing safer or more efficacious drugs for use in pain management  particularly in the area of opioid painkillers 
us sales of opioid painkillers exceeded billion in we own worldwide commercial rights to all of our drug candidates 
our clinical pipeline consists of three proprietary drug candidates 
we are developing these three oral  small molecule drugs to treat patients who suffer from severe chronic pain  such as pain associated with advanced osteoarthritis  low back pain or ibs 
our drug candidates are oxytrex  a new oral opioid painkiller that is currently in two phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of severe chronic pain  
table of contents pti  a drug candidate to treat men and women with ibs that is currently in two phase iii clinical trials  and remoxy  an anti abuse version of long acting oxycodone that is currently in one phase iii clinical trial and non clinical studies 
we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
we have not been profitable and  since our inception on may  through december   we have recorded an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  salaries and other personnel related costs and general corporate expenses 
research and development activities include costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our drug candidates 
salaries and other personnel related costs include non cash stock based compensation associated with options granted to employees and non employees 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates and our need for clinical supplies 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the next several years 
our cash requirements for operating activities and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the future as we continue to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  including the phase iii clinical trials of oxytrex  pti and remoxy as well as formulation and development activities for remoxy  seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our drug candidates 
if our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our drug candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our drugs and or  if we license our drugs to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from sales of licensed products 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  our collaborators  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
since our inception  we have focused all our research and development efforts on the research and development of opioid drugs for the treatment of pain 
research and development expenses related to this project for the period from inception through december  total million 
the following table summarizes expenses by category for research and development efforts in thousands years ended december  may  inception through december compensation contractor fees supplies other 
table of contents contractor fees generally include expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
supplies generally include costs for formulation and manufacturing activities 
other generally includes the allocation of common costs such as facilities 
our technology has been applied across our portfolio of drug candidates 
data  know how  personnel  clinical results  research results and other matters related to the research and development of any one of our drug candidates also relate to  and further the development of  our other drug candidates 
as a result  costs allocated to a specific drug candidate may not necessarily reflect the actual costs surrounding research and development of that drug candidate due to cross application of the foregoing 
estimating the dates of completion of clinical development  and the costs to complete development  of our drug candidates would be highly speculative  subjective and potentially misleading 
pharmaceutical products take a significant amount of time to research  develop and commercialize 
the clinical trial portion of the development of a new drug alone usually spans several years 
we expect to reassess our future research and development plans based on our review of data we receive from our current research and development activities 
the cost and pace of our future research and development activities are linked and subject to change 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to contract agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments expenses for clinical trials 
expenses for clinical trials are incurred from planning through patient enrollment to reporting of the underlying data 
we estimate expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on patient enrollment and based on clinical data collection and management 
costs that are associated with patient enrollment are recognized as each patient in the trial completes enrollment 
costs that are based on clinical data collection and management are recognized based on estimates of unbilled goods and services received 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would accrue an amount based on estimates of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with winding down the trial 
stock based compensation 
the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes to the assumptions used in the black scholes model may materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of current accounting standards related to employee stock options 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and research and development research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in phase iii clinical trials activities for oxytrex  pti and remoxy as well as continued development activities for remoxy 
we expect research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our development efforts 
our development efforts should result in our drug candidates progressing through various stages of clinical trials  including our phase iii trials of oxytrex  pti and remoxy 
also  we expect to continue other development efforts on our product candidates 
the increase in research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical trials and studies 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years in connection with precommercialization and commercialization activities for our product candidates 
the increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of clinical trials and studies 
interest income interest income increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in average balances of marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to decrease during as we use cash to fund our operations 
years ended december  and research and development research and development expense consists primarily of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including costs of preclinical studies  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in expense was primarily due to the development costs related to our new drug candidate remoxy as well as for the ongoing development and phase iii programs for oxytrex and pti 
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses as well as non cash stock based compensation 
general and administrative expense decreased to from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from lower non cash equity related expense as well as a reclassification of certain occupancy and other expenses to research and development 
interest income interest income decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as lower returns on the investment of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private securities offerings 
we intend to continue to use the proceeds from these offerings to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
in october  we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a follow on public offering and received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
our other financing activities provided million in the year ended december   primarily from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock plan 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities in both years related primarily to the funding of operating losses 
our investing activities to purchase property  equipment and leasehold improvements used cash of million for the year ended december  other investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of the purchase and sale of marketable securities 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our operations 
we lease approximately  square feet of general office space 
in addition to office space  we also lease equipment pursuant to operating leases 
our leases expire at various dates through under the terms of our real property and equipment leases  annual minimum lease payments are as follows as of december  in thousands and thereafter total minimum lease payments we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of milestones  including clinical milestones 
our formulation agreement with durect corporation obligates us to make certain milestone payments upon achieving clinical milestones and regulatory milestones 
we believe the amount of each of these milestone payments will be immaterial within the period such milestone is achieved 
our license agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
all of these potential future payments are cancelable as of december  since our inception we have used cash of million in operating activities and have an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur significant additional losses for the next several years and expect our cash requirements to increase in the future 
the amount and timing our future cash 
table of contents requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our drug candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
risk factors our future operating results may vary substantially from anticipated results due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations 
you should carefully consider these factors before making an investment decision 
if any of the following factors actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
in that case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could experience losses on your investment 
risks relating to our financial position and need for financing our operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business to date and to assess its future viability 
we were founded in may and are in the development stage 
our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company  acquiring  developing and securing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates 
we have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approval  formulate and manufacture our drug candidates on a commercial scale or conduct sales and marketing activities 
consequently  any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history 
we have a history of losses and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception 
as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our drug candidates  we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future  and we may never become profitable 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  including the phase iii clinical trials of oxytrex  pti and remoxy as well as formulation and development activities for remoxy  seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we cannot successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our drug candidates  we will not be able to generate such revenues or achieve profitability in the future 
our failure to achieve or maintain profitability would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to complete planned clinical trials of any or some of our drug candidates or to pursue attractive business opportunities 
we have funded all of our operations and capital expenditures with the proceeds from public and private stock offerings 
we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds within such twelve month period or thereafter and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
even if we succeed in selling additional securities to raise funds  our existing stockholders ownership percentage would be reduced and new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we raise additional capital through strategic alliance and license arrangements  we may have to trade our rights to our technology  intellectual property or drug candidates to others in such arrangements on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we determine that we need to raise additional funds and we are not successful in doing so  we may be unable to complete the clinical development of some or all of our drug candidates or to seek or obtain fda approval of our drug candidates 
we then could be forced to discontinue product development  enter into a relationship with a strategic partner earlier than currently intended  reduce sales and marketing efforts or forego attractive business opportunities 
clinical and regulatory risks if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be allowed to commercialize our drug candidates  and we will not generate product revenues 
satisfaction of all regulatory requirements typically takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research and development and testing 
our research and clinical approaches may not lead to drugs that the fda considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses we are studying 
the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical testing  in which case we would have to expend additional time and resources and would likely delay the date of potentially receiving regulatory approval 
in particular  the fda may require additional toxicology studies for certain excipients used in remoxy or any of our other drug candidates 
the approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation  future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals will delay commercialization of  and product revenues from  our drug candidates  and diminish the competitive advantages that we may have otherwise enjoyed  which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
even if we comply with all fda regulatory requirements  we may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates we will have fewer saleable products  if any  and corresponding lower product revenues  if any 
even if we receive regulatory approval of our drug candidates  such approval may involve limitations on the indications and conditions of use or marketing claims we may make for our products 
further  later discovery of previously unknown problems or adverse events could result in additional regulatory restrictions  including withdrawal of products 
the fda may also require us to commit to perform lengthy phase iv post approval studies  for which we would have to expend additional resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in jurisdictions outside the united states  we must receive marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs 
regulatory approval processes outside the united states generally include all of the aforementioned requirements and risks associated with fda approval 
if we are unable to design  conduct and complete clinical trials successfully  we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates 
in order to obtain fda approval for any of our drug candidates  we must submit to the fda a new drug application  or nda  that demonstrates that the drug candidate is safe and effective in humans for its intended 
table of contents use 
this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests  which are referred to as preclinical studies  as well as human tests  which are referred to as clinical trials 
oxytrex  pti and remoxy are in phase iii clinical trials in the united states 
our phase iii clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of our drug candidates 
success in pre clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful 
results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre clinical testing 
fda guidelines recommend that the efficacy of new painkillers be demonstrated in more than one clinical model of pain 
this means that even if one of our phase iii clinical trials demonstrates positive results for our drug candidates  we are likely to have to demonstrate positive results in one or more additional phase iii clinical trials prior to receiving broad label fda approval for treatment of severe chronic pain 
even if the results of our phase iii clinical trials are positive  we may have to commit substantial time and additional resources to conducting further preclinical and clinical studies before we can submit ndas or obtain fda approvals for our drug candidates 
clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement  in part because they are subject to rigorous requirements 
the clinical trial process is also time consuming 
furthermore  if participating patients in clinical studies suffer drug related adverse reactions during the course of such trials  or if we or the fda believe that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  we will have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials 
failure can occur at any stage of the trials  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat clinical studies 
in addition  completion of clinical trials can be delayed by numerous factors  including delays in identifying and agreeing on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites  slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment  increases in time required to complete monitoring of patients during or after participation in a trial  and unexpected need for additional patient related data 
any of these delays  if significant  could impact the timing  approval and commercialization of our drug candidates and could significantly increase our overall costs of drug development 
even if our clinical trials are completed as planned  their results may not support our expectations or intended marketing claims 
the clinical trials process may fail to demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe and effective for indicated uses 
such failure would cause us to abandon a drug candidate and could delay development of other drug candidates 
clinical trial designs that were discussed with authorities prior to their commencement may subsequently be considered insufficient for approval at the time of application for regulatory approval 
we discuss with and obtain guidance from regulatory authorities on certain of our clinical development activities 
these discussions are not binding obligations on the part of regulatory authorities 
regulatory authorities may revise previous guidance or decide to ignore previous guidance at any time during the course of our clinical activities or after the completion of our clinical trials 
even with successful clinical safety and efficacy data  we may be required to conduct additional  expensive trials to obtain regulatory approval 
developments by competitors may establish standards of care that affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials as planned 
we have conducted clinical trials of our drug candidates comparing our drug candidates to both placebo and other approved drugs 
changes in standards related to clinical trial design could affect our ability to design and conduct clinical trials as planned 
for example  regulatory authorities may not allow us to compare our drug candidates to placebo in a particular clinical indication where approved products are available 
in that case  both the cost and the amount of time required to conduct a trial could increase 

table of contents the drug enforcement administration  or dea  limits the availability of the active ingredients in certain of our current drug candidates and  as a result  our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials  or to meet commercial demand or may result in clinical delays 
the dea regulates chemical compounds as schedule i  ii  iii  iv or v substances  with schedule i substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and schedule v substances the lowest risk 
certain active ingredients in our current drug candidates  such as oxycodone  are listed by the dea as schedule ii under the controlled substances act of consequently  their manufacture  research  shipment  storage  sale and use are subject to a high degree of oversight and regulation 
for example  all schedule ii drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician  physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription 
furthermore  the amount of schedule ii substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the dea and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand 
there is a risk that dea regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials  and  in the future  our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand 
government agencies may establish and promulgate usage guidelines that directly apply to our drug candidates 
government agencies  professional and medical societies  and other groups may establish usage guidelines that apply to our drug candidates 
these guidelines could address such matters as usage and dose  among other factors 
application of such guidelines could limit the use of our drug candidates 
conducting clinical trials of our drug candidates or potential commercial sales of a drug candidate may expose us to expensive product liability claims and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all 
the risk of product liability is inherent in the testing of pharmaceutical products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or terminate testing of one or more of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
we currently carry clinical trial insurance but do not carry product liability insurance 
if we successfully commercialize one or more of our drug candidates  we may face product liability claims  regardless of fda approval for commercial manufacturing and sale 
we may not be able to obtain such insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses  such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise 
if we receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates  we and our collaborators will also be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory review  such as continued safety reporting requirements  and we and our collaborators may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations or new regulations  all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our potential drugs 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our drug candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies 
in addition  if the fda approves any of our drug candidates  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping for the drug will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drug  and could include withdrawal of the drug from the market 
the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse 
table of contents government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
any of these events could prevent us from marketing our drugs and our business could suffer 
risks relating to commercialization if physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs  we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
even if the fda approves our drugs  physicians and patients may not accept and use them 
acceptance and use of our drugs will depend on a number of factors including perceptions by members of the healthcare community  including physicians  about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs  published studies demonstrating the cost effectiveness of our drugs relative to competing products  availability of reimbursement for our products from government or healthcare payers  our ability to implement a risk management plan prior to the distribution of any schedule ii drug  and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors  if any 
because we expect to rely on sales generated by our current lead drug candidates for substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future  the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing 
if we are unable to develop our own sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or if we are not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms  or at all  our product revenues could be disappointing 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize our products  if any are approved by the fda  we will either have to develop such capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties who can perform these services for us 
if we decide to commercialize any of our drugs ourselves  we may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales  marketing and distribution operations which are capable of successfully launching new drugs and generating sufficient product revenues 
in addition  establishing such operations will take time and involve significant expense 
if we decide to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to locate acceptable collaborators because the number of potential collaborators is limited and because of competition from others for similar alliances with potential collaborators 
even if we are able to identify one or more acceptable collaborators  we may not be able to enter into any collaborative arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the nature of the market for pain management products  it may be necessary for us to license all or substantially all of our drug candidates to a single collaborator  thereby eliminating our opportunity to commercialize other pain management products independently 
if we enter into any collaborative arrangements  our revenues are likely to be lower than if we marketed and sold our products ourselves 
in addition  any revenues we receive would depend upon our collaborators efforts which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments  management turnover  change of strategic focus  further business combinations or other factors outside of our control 
depending upon the terms of our collaboration  the remedies we have against an under performing collaborator may be limited 
if we were to terminate the relationship  it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement collaborator on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents if we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
the market for our drug candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our drug candidates receive fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products  or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
if our products are unable to capture and maintain market share  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
we will compete for market share against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies or other companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
many of these competitors have opioid painkillers already approved or in development 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do  as well as significantly greater experience in developing drugs  conducting preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of drugs  formulating and manufacturing drugs  and launching  marketing  distributing and selling drugs 
our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from healthcare payers 
our ability to commercialize our drugs  alone or with collaborators  will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health maintenance organizations and health insurers  and other healthcare payers 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
healthcare payers  including medicare  health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and or are seeking pharmacoeconomic data to justify formulary acceptance and reimbursement practices 
we currently have not generated pharmacoeconomic data on any of our products 
government and other healthcare payers increasingly are attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs  and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has or has not granted labeling approval 
adequate third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any products we discover and develop  alone or with collaborators 
if government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  market acceptance of our product candidates could be limited 
risks relating to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our competitors could develop and market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our products 
our success  competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
if we  albert einstein college of medicine or our other collaborators fail to file  
table of contents prosecute or maintain certain patents  our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of our products  and demand for our products could decline as a result 
in january  the us patent and trademark office  or pto  disclosed that a law firm for an unidentified third party filed requests for an ex parte reexamination related to certain claims on patents we exclusively licensed from albert einstein college of medicine 
as of february  reexamination certificates have been issued resolving the majority of the proceedings by confirming the patentability of the claims of the patents and adding new claims to several patents 
in addition  notices of intent to issue reexamination certificates have been issued in the remaining proceedings 
we may be involved in additional challenges to our intellectual property 
an adverse outcome of the reexamination process or any other challenges to our intellectual property could result in loss of claims of these patents that pertain to certain drugs we currently have under development and could have a material adverse impact on our future revenues 
we intend to file additional patent applications relating to our technology  products and processes 
we may direct albert einstein college of medicine or our collaborators to file additional patent applications relating to the licensed technology or we may do so ourselves 
however  our competitors may challenge  invalidate or circumvent any of our current or future patents 
these patents may also fail to provide us with meaningful competitive advantages 
we may become involved in expensive litigation or other legal proceedings related to our existing intellectual property rights  including patents 
we expect that we will rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know how or require us to license such information and pay significant fees or royalties in order to produce our products 
our technology could infringe upon claims of patents owned by others 
if we were found to be infringing on a patent held by another  we might have to seek a license to use the patented technology 
in that case  we might not be able to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if a legal action were to be brought against us or our licensors  we could incur substantial defense costs  and any such action might not be resolved in our favor 
if such a dispute were to be resolved against us  we could have to pay the other party large sums of money and our use of our technology and the testing  manufacture  marketing or sale of one or more of our proposed products could be restricted or prohibited 
risks relating to our business and strategy competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense  and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  we could experience delays in completing necessary clinical trials  in the regulatory approval process or in formulating  manufacturing  marketing and selling our potential products 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in clinical research  preclinical testing  government regulation  formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals  particularly in the san francisco bay area  is intense  and our search for such personnel may not be successful 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success 
if third party manufacturers of our drug candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns  or if their performance is substandard  our clinical trials and product introductions may be delayed and our costs may be higher than expected 
we have no manufacturing facilities and have limited experience in drug product development and commercial manufacturing 
we lack the resources and expertise to formulate  manufacture or test the technical 
table of contents performance of our drug candidates 
we currently rely on a limited number of experienced personnel and a small number of contract manufacturers and other vendors to formulate  test  supply  store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials 
our reliance on a limited number of vendors exposes us to the following risks  any of which could delay our clinical trials  and  consequently  fda approval of our drug candidates and commercialization of our products  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues contract commercial manufacturers  their sub contractors or other third parties we rely on  may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy clinical needs or commercial demand  may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the manufacture of pharmaceutical products  and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations 
our contract manufacturers could default on their agreements with us to provide clinical supplies or meet our requirements for commercialization of our products 
the use of alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary governmental licenses to produce narcotic products is limited 
additionally  the fda and the dea must approve any alternative manufacturer of our product before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce our supplies 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly  or at all 
our contract manufacturers and vendors may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce  store and distribute our products 
if any contract manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to such innovation 
our employees and consultants are generally subject to confidentiality or other agreements with their former employers and they may inadvertently or otherwise violate those agreements 
many of our employees and consultants were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
while we require our employees and consultants to honor any agreements they may have entered into prior to working with us  we may be subject to claims that we inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other confidential information belonging to former employers 
failure to defend such claims could result in loss of valuable rights or personnel  which in turn could harm or prevent commercialization of our drug candidates 
successful defense against such claims can be expensive and might distract us from our execution of our strategies 
law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioids and social issues around abuse of opioids may make the regulatory approval process very difficult for our drug candidates 
media stories regarding the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are commonplace 
law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may apply policies that seek to limit the availability of opioids 
such efforts may adversely affect the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates 
developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
alternative technologies and products are being developed to improve or replace the use of opioids for pain management  several of which are in clinical trials or are awaiting approval from the fda 
in addition  the active ingredients in nearly all opioid drugs are available in generic form 
drug companies that sell generic opioid drugs represent substantial competition 
many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
our competitors may market less expensive or more effective drugs that would compete with our product candidates 
table of contents or reach market with competing drugs before we are able to reach market with our drug candidates 
these organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and partners for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations as well as those of our collaborators on which we depend are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  electrical and telecommunication failures  international acts of terror and similar events 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses we may suffer 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations 
risks relating to manufacturing we rely on third party commercial drug manufacturers for drug supply 
approved third party commercial drug manufacturers may subsequently be stopped from producing  storing  shipping or testing our drug products due to their non compliance with federal  state or local regulations 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda  the dea  and corresponding state and foreign government agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
in addition  even if we enter into long term supply arrangements with third party suppliers  we cannot control changes in strategy by third party suppliers that affect their ability or willingness to continue to supply our drug products on acceptable terms 
if our drug supply for one of our drug candidates was interrupted  our operations could be negatively affected 
if we cannot formulate and scale up a wide range of dosage forms of remoxy  we might determine that the commercial opportunity for remoxy is too limited to warrant further investment in clinical testing and development 
we plan to formulate and scale up a wide range of dosage forms of remoxy 
we may not be able to successfully complete our formulation or scale up activities or we may determine that the commercial opportunity for remoxy in certain dosage forms is too limited to warrant further investment 
if we unsuccessful in our formulation or scale up activities with remoxy  our future sales may be less than expected and our operations may suffer 
risks relating to our collaboration agreements if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  our regulatory submissions and our product introductions may be delayed 
we depend on independent investigators and collaborators  such as universities and medical institutions  to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us 
these collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
these investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves 
if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  the approval of our regulatory submissions and our introductions of new drugs will be delayed 

table of contents our collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
if outside collaborators assist our competitors to our detriment  the approval of our regulatory submissions will be delayed and the sales from our products will be less than expected 
we may not succeed at in licensing drug candidates or technologies to expand our product pipeline 
we may not successfully in license drug candidates or technologies to expand our product pipeline 
the number of such candidates or technologies may be limited 
competition among large pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies for promising drug candidates or technologies is intense because such companies generally desire to expand their product pipelines through in licensing 
our collaborative agreements may not succeed or may give rise to disputes over intellectual property or other issues 
our strategy to focus on development of novel drug candidates discovered by third parties requires us to enter into license agreements with such third parties 
in addition  we may enter into collaborative agreements to commercialize our products 
such agreements are generally complex and contain provisions that could give rise to legal disputes 
such disputes can delay the development of potential new drug products  or can lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
other factors relating to collaborative agreements may adversely affect the success of our drug candidates  including the development of parallel products by our collaborators or by a competitor  arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing certain products or technologies  premature termination of a collaborative agreement  or failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development of our potential products 
risks relating to an investment in our common stock our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
the following factors  in addition to other risk factors described in this section  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock results of or delays in our preclinical and clinical trials  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  
table of contents period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 
the national association of securities dealers  inc  or nasd  and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  have adopted certain new rules 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new rules  we could be delisted from trading on the nasdaq national market  or nasdaq  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the nasd 
as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 
our charter documents contain provisions that may prevent or delay removal of incumbent management or a change of control 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management  engage in proxy contests and effect changes in control 
these provisions include a classified board so that only one third of our board of directors is elected each year  elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals  the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval  and the ability of our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights  privileges and preferences as our board of directors may determine 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  section prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in section these provisions  alone or together  could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management  proxy contests or changes in control 
volatility in the stock prices of other companies may contribute to volatility in our stock price 
the stock market in general  nasdaq and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of early stage and development stage life sciences companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
our share ownership is concentrated  and our officers  directors and principal stockholders can exert significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
due to their combined stock holdings  our officers  directors and principal stockholders stockholders holding greater than of our common stock acting collectively may have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of 
table of contents significant corporate transactions 
in addition  this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of these stockholders 
publicly available information regarding stockholders ownership may not be comprehensive because the sec does not require certain large stockholders to publicly disclose their stock ownership positions 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include  among other items  the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates  our need for clinical supplies and the re measurement of certain deferred stock compensation 
thus  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not indicative of what we might expect in the future 
as a result  in some future quarters our clinical  financial or operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors that could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on nasdaq 
investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instrument 
as of december   our investments consisted of available for sale investments in corporate and government notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable  market rates of interest
