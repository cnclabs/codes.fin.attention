part i item business overview hms holdings corp 
furnishes cost containment  revenue recovery  cost reporting and business office outsourcing services to healthcare providers and payors 
we help our clients increase revenue  accelerate collections  and reduce operating and administrative costs 
we operate two businesses through our wholly owned subsidiaries  health management systems  inc health management systems and accordis inc 
accordis 
health management systems works on behalf of government healthcare programs to contain costs by recovering expenditures that were the responsibility of a third party  or that were paid inappropriately 
health management systems clients include state and county medicaid programs  their managed care plans  child support enforcement agencies  state prescription drug programs and other public programs 
accordis provides business office outsourcing services for hospitals  emergency medical transport agencies  and other healthcare providers 
these business office services may include identifying third party resources  submitting timely and accurate bills to third party payors and patients  recovering and properly accounting for the amounts due  responding to customer service questions from patients  and securing the appropriate cost based reimbursement from entitlement programs 
clients may outsource the entirety of their business office operations to us  or discrete components of the revenue cycle 
on march   we announced that we had commenced a strategic review of all of the alternatives available to us for increasing the return on the resources we employ in delivering services to providers through our accordis subsidiary 
subsequent to the issuance of our press release on march  announcing the results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended december   the following items were recorded we reclassified million of municipal auction rate securities as short term marketable securities  which were previously disclosed as cash and cash equivalents 
this change in classification had no effect on the amounts of total current assets  total assets  net income or cash flow from operations 

table of contents on march   we received million in settlement of two accounts receivable from the district of columbia and also recognized contingent recovery fees and settlement expenses approximating million resulting from the settlement 
although this settlement was negotiated and received subsequent to december   we reflected it in the results of operations as the subsequent settlement of this litigation eliminated the need for a bad debt allowance against these accounts receivable at december  accordingly  we adjusted accounts receivable at december  to million  the amount of the settlement  and reduced bad debt expense by million  which is included in direct project costs 
we reclassified million of deferred tax assets to current assets 
healthcare reform and regulatory matters the healthcare reimbursement landscape continues to evolve 
federal  state  and local governments  as well as other third party payors  continue their efforts to reduce the rate of growth in healthcare expenditures 
many of these policy initiatives have contributed to the complex and time consuming nature of obtaining healthcare reimbursement for medical services 
our clients are subject to comprehensive federal and state regulation  which affects hospital reimbursement 
medicaid and medicare account for a significant portion of hospital revenue 
since adoption  the medicaid and medicare programs have undergone significant and frequent changes  and it is realistic to expect additional changes in the future 
our services are subject to regulations pertaining to billing for medicaid and medicare services  which primarily involve record keeping requirements and other provisions designed to prevent fraud 
we believe that we operate in a manner consistent with such regulations  the enforcement of which is increasingly more stringent 
violations of such regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the medicare program is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  an agency of the united states department of health and human services 
cms currently contracts with several intermediaries and fiscal agents to process regional claims for reimbursement 
although cms has established the regulatory framework for medicare claims administration  medicare intermediaries have the authority to develop independent procedures for administering the claims reimbursement process 
the medicaid program is subject to regulation by cms  but is administered by state governments 
state governments provide for medicaid claims reimbursement either through the establishment of state operated processing centers or through contractual arrangements with third party fiscal agents who operate their own processing centers 
the requirements and procedures for reimbursement implemented by medicaid differ from state to state 
similar to the claims administration processes of medicare and medicaid  many national health insurance companies and self insured employers adjudicate claims through local or regional offices 
consequently  because guidelines for the reimbursement of claims are generally established by third party payors at local or regional levels  hospital and other provider reimbursement managers must remain current with the local procedures and requirements of third party payors 
generally  we are required to maintain standards of confidentiality that are comparable to those of an agency administering the medicare or medicaid program when we use data obtained from such programs 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of requires the secretary of health and human services to adopt national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions and to adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information 
all covered entities providers  payors  and clearinghouses will be mandated to implement administrative  physical  and technical safeguards to protect health data covered by hipaa 
the regulations are in the following stages of finalization and implementation transaction and code set standards 
the final regulation governing transaction and code set standards was published and was expected to become effective on october  however  on december  the administrative simplification compliance act asca was enacted providing for a one year extension of the date for complying with the hipaa standard transactions and code set requirements for any covered entity that submits to the secretary of health and human services a plan on how the entity will come into compliance with the requirements by october  we submitted such a plan to be in full compliance with the standard transaction and code set requirements by the october  deadline 
as of october   however  a number of providers  payors and clearinghouses were still not ready to submit and or 
table of contents accept certain standard transactions 
cms  as well as a number of fiscal intermediaries and other payors  announced transition time periods during which legacy transaction and code set formats would still be accepted  albeit for a limited time only 
as of december   a limited number of these transition periods  including the one announced by cms  are still in effect 
in these instances  as applicable  we continue to test with those trading partners operating under transition plans and expect to be fully compliant by the time the transition time periods expire 
privacy regulation 
the privacy regulation was published as a final regulation and became effective on april   requiring all covered entities to be fully compliant by april  we believe we were in full compliance with the privacy regulation by the april  deadline and continue to be compliant 
data security 
the data security regulation was published as a final regulation on february   with an effective date of april  full compliance is required by april  we are working toward being fully compliant by that date and have every expectation of being so 
any material restriction on the ability of healthcare providers and payors to obtain or disseminate health information could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
with the release of the final hipaa privacy and security rules  the protection of individually identifiable healthcare information becomes a key component of the way we and other covered entities perform our day to day business 
principal products and services health management systems health management systems offers a variety of services that help government healthcare entitlement programs  most notably state medicaid agencies  contain costs and recover revenue 
to date  these revenue recoveries total more than billion  after having passed the billion milestone in october our services derive from the complexity of medicaid and other healthcare entitlement programs  and the many rules that govern relationships among them 
established in  medicaid is administered by individual states  and is jointly funded by the federal and state governments 
because medicaid is the payor of last resort  the federal government imposed statutory obligations in the early s requiring states to actively recover payments made on behalf of beneficiaries who have other forms of third party health insurance 
in  health management systems began offering state medicaid agencies services to identify third parties with prior liability for medicaid claims 
using proprietary information management techniques  we have developed methodologies that generally include the following steps identification we use proprietary software to match medicaid and other program data files to insurance eligibility files obtained by us from third parties such as medicare  commercial insurers  hmos  third party administrators  tricare  and others 
this process identifies potential third party eligibility 
validation after identification of potential third party liability  we validate insurance eligibility by verifying coverage for specific benefits 
this process is performed by deploying automated electronic transactions and call center representatives 
recovery when eligibility and coverage are in effect for a specific medicaid member and related episode of care  we pursue recovery of the medicaid payment from the liable third party 
most often we recover from third parties through direct billing of insurers or disallowance of overpayments to the provider of services 
on occasion  we recover payments through negotiated settlements 
cost avoidance upon verification of coverage or payment of claims by liable third parties  we electronically submit this coverage data to our medicaid clients 
this data is used to avoid paying similar claims for the medicaid member on a going forward basis 

table of contents these proprietary methodologies are the foundation for our suite of coordination of benefits cob services 
in addition  we use a variety of auditing and information management techniques to help clients identify and recover other inappropriate payments for example  duplicate payments  payments that are made on behalf of a deceased beneficiary  or payments that result from fraud and abuse 
accordis accordis offers emergency medical transport providers  hospitals and other healthcare providers business office services and reimbursement services 
emergency medical transport provider services 
we offer our clients a combination of technology  data processing capacity  and revenue cycle expertise to assist ambulance providers in improving cash flow and reducing the cost to bill and collect 
accordis applies its revenue management expertise to ensure optimal reimbursement for all types of ambulance service providers hospital based and municipal  reducing the significant administrative burden of billing third parties and patients 
we utilize our proprietary accessline system to track all liquidation activity associated with ambulance accounts  and provide clients with real time access to account information 
reimbursement services 
our reimbursement services ensure that healthcare providers correctly document services which qualify for special reimbursement through the medicare cost report and other governmental payment mechanisms 
coinsurance and deductible balances constitute a significant and growing component of medicare reimbursement 
the federal government recognizes that these balances often remain uncollected  and allows for a cost report adjustment to claim these amounts as bad debt expense  however  the reporting requirements are very demanding 
our medicare bad debt reporting service accurately documents qualifying balances and assists clients in supplying all documentation required for governmental audit 
since  medicare has allowed hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income patients to claim additional federal reimbursement to offset the expense of serving this population 
again  the reporting requirements are significant  and require an increasing amount of reconciliation between the hospital s own records and government systems 
our disproportionate share reporting service assists hospitals in qualifying for reimbursement under this program  through the medicare cost report related filings and professional support during audits 
business office services 
our business office services encompass all or a portion of the patient accounting activities that make up a healthcare provider s revenue cycle 
such revenue cycle activities may include third party resource identification and validation  submission of timely and accurate bills to primary and secondary payors  generation of patient statements  response to patient and third party questions  recovery of payments due  and proper accounting for payments  contractual allowances and write offs 
these services are designed to increase the provider s revenue  improve the proportion of provider gross charges ultimately collected  accelerate cash flow  lower days in accounts receivable  and reduce administrative costs 
a client may outsource one or more aspects of its patient accounting processes or may outsource the business office in its entirety 
in some cases  our services are used by providers who need assistance in liquidating aged or complex accounts 
at the request of a client  we are also able to provide bad debt collection services through a wholly owned subsidiary 
customers health management systems clients primarily consist of government healthcare and human services agencies within state and county governments 
we also serve managed care plans that work with these agencies 
typically  clients award contracts for three to five year terms  and we receive contingency fees calculated as a percentage of the amounts recovered 
we now have contracts with states and managed care plans 

table of contents accordis clients are public  voluntary and for profit acute care hospitals and associated clinics  emergency medical transport agencies and large physician practices 
among accordis clients are the nation s three largest public health systems and the two largest emergency medical transport agencies 
we engage in both multi year and short term engagements with our clients and substantially all of the engagements provide for contingent fees calculated as a percentage of the amounts recovered or collected for the client 
our largest client is the los angeles county department of health services in california 
this client accounted for   and of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on accordis and hms holdings corp 
we provide los angeles county or designated facilities within los angeles county with  among other services  secondary third party resource identification and recovery services  commercial insurance billing services  medi cal billing and follow up services  and financial management and consulting services relating to both inpatient and outpatient accounts 
either party may terminate the agreement with or without cause upon written notice days notice for los angeles county and days notice from us  except that financial management and consulting services require days written notice of termination 
we provide services to this client pursuant to a contract awarded in april for a one year period with two annual automatic renewals through june we have been providing services to this client for more than years 
the clients constituting our ten largest clients change periodically 
the concentration of revenue in such accounts was  and  of our revenue in the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
in many instances  we provide our services pursuant to agreements subject to competitive re procurement 
all of these agreements expire between and we cannot provide any assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed and  if renewed  that the fee rates will be equal to those currently in effect 
market trends opportunities health management systems health management systems business is defined by the nation s expensive and complex system of government funded healthcare including entitlement programs such as medicaid  medicare  and programs administered by the department of defense and the public health service 
in addition  state governments operate their own programs to address the healthcare needs of their citizens 
several factors drive the financial characteristics of this market the hierarchy of programs and payors  the shared funding of programs between federal and state governments  the government budget and appropriations process  and the steadily rising cost of healthcare in the country 
in  government programs accounted for  or billion  of the trillion spent on healthcare in the united states  according to cms 
since then  government healthcare spending  especially for medicaid  has only increased 
more americans have enrolled in the medicaid program  bringing the total number of beneficiaries to million 
in calendar year  medicaid s total spending is estimated to have reached billion  making medicaid the largest healthcare payor in the country and the program s total spending is forecast to grow at to annually in coming years 
in  medicaid spending also grew to become the single largest expenditure by states  larger even than education 
and state medicaid spending is expected to grow at an average of in fiscal year the most significant increase in recent years according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured 
this dramatic growth is a result  in part  of the expiration of federal emergency relief in the growth far outstrips the recent progress states have made in reversing the decline of their tax revenues 
no wonder that in fiscal year  every state in the nation plans to implement new cost containment measures for medicaid 
in addition  states now are preparing to take on additional costs related to the medicare modernization act  which was enacted during while the act s prescription drug benefit  which goes into effect in  ultimately will alleviate some of the costs states have borne  the act also saddles them with a host of new 
table of contents administrative responsibilities 
moreover  states will forego most of their potential savings by making required clawback payments to the federal government 
as a result  the congressional budget office estimates  states will not see significant savings for years to come and will pay a net cost of more than billion in as these fiscal pressures and government healthcare spending have grown  so too has the need for proper coordination of benefits and overpayment recovery 
from the office of management and budget  the congressional management office and other data  it is estimated that as much as of medicaid expenditures result from overpayment errors and payments where third party liability existed 
accordis a number of factors are forcing healthcare providers to manage their patient accounts more efficiently 
although the aggregate medicare and medicaid funding received by hospitals may be growing  federal and state healthcare cost control initiatives are acting to reduce the proportion of medicare and medicaid classified hospital charges that are reimbursed by government sources 
the coordination of benefits associated with ongoing changes to the eligibility for  and coverage available under  governmental  managed care  and commercial insurance programs is increasingly complex 
the rising underinsured and uninsured populations pose a significant challenge especially to public hospitals  which comprise a considerable portion of our client base 
as providers deliver increasingly more services in outpatient settings  their accounts receivable portfolios have become skewed toward high volume  low balance accounts  creating significantly more work for the business office staff 
with the increasing complexity of the healthcare reimbursement environment and shortages of qualified labor in many areas  it is more and more difficult for an individual provider institution to maintain in house the expertise required to operate patient accounting functions 
as a result of these pressures  and as well to reduce cost  providers are now engaging outside help at an earlier stage in the revenue cycle and are seeking help in executing more of the functions of their business offices 
a number have entirely outsourced the management of their patient accounting functions  as they seek to focus limited management and financial resources on the delivery of patient care 
we offer providers a cost effective outsourcing alternative by virtue of our specialized workforce  through which we offer business office expertise  aptitude with patient accounting technology based tools  extensive knowledge of federal  state  and local health regulations and experience in dealing with government agencies  commercial insurance companies  and others involved in administering medical assistance or insurance programs 
competition health management systems health management systems targets federal and state healthcare programs  medicaid managed care plans  state prescription drug programs  child support enforcement agencies  and other public programs 
we compete primarily with public consulting group  with large national public accounting firms  and with small regional firms specializing in one or more of our services 
we compete on the basis of our dominant position in the coordination of benefits marketplace  our extensive eligibility database  our proprietary systems  historically high recovery rates  and pricing

we compete on the basis of our healthcare business office and payor program expertise  proprietary technology and systems  existing relationships  long standing reputation in the provider market segment  and pricing 

table of contents business strategy health management systems the health management systems business strategy includes the following initiatives grow client base 
health management systems plans to add clients by tapping the built in demand created by the growth of government funded healthcare 
we expect our new clients to include state medicaid programs  medicaid managed care plans  and other state human service agencies 
in addition  we intend to dedicate resources to pursuing clients within the federally funded healthcare system  such as the medicare program and the department of defense tricare program 
continue to leverage technology 
in  hms implemented a variety of technology tools to streamline interaction with providers and speed the recovery of third party costs at near real time 
going forward  we intend to continue using technology in innovative ways to enhance the efficiency of our efforts and improve service to clients 
expand our portfolio of services 
in response to client demand  hms plans to draw on its core competencies to expand its range of services and revenue recovery techniques 
for example  we are exploring new approaches to pharmacy cost containment  as well as identification and recovery of costs related to fraud  abuse  and waste 
expand client engagements 
as we identify new types of opportunities for government healthcare agencies to contain costs  we expect to grow the scope of our engagements with clients 
in some cases  this expansion will be incremental  accomplished through value added services that build upon our ongoing work with clients 
in other cases  we expect these engagements to migrate into full outsourcing relationships  as clients recognize the increasing need for external resources 
this is the model that our work has followed in the state of florida  where we have served as the cob outsourcer since november and successfully renewed our contract in accordis the accordis business strategy is to offer hospitals  emergency medical transport services and other healthcare providers a comprehensive solution for their business office requirements

 revenue recognition in financial statements sab for our fiscal year ended october   implementing a change in accounting in regard to revenue generated from clients seeking reimbursement from third party payors where our fees are contingent upon the client s collections from third parties 
as of november   we recognized revenue pertaining to such clients once the third party payor remitted payment to our client 
this policy change reduced revenue by million and increased net loss by million for fiscal year  excluding the cumulative effect of the change 
the million cumulative effect reflects million of unbilled receivables partially offset by million of related direct costs and million of income tax benefit 
as of october   we had unbilled accounts receivable of million related to our prior revenue recognition policy that had not been invoiced to clients because we were contractually obligated to invoice the client only after they received payment from the responsible third party payors 
of this amount  we subsequently recognized the following amounts in revenue and operating results period revenue in thousands fiscal two months ended dec 
 fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal we were unable to subsequently recognize as revenue million of the million in accounts receivable that were included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of november  the uncollectible amounts are primarily attributable to projects for state agencies that were undertaken to recoup payments from parties with prior liability for medicaid claims 
in the case of several of these projects  the state agencies  after the completion of the projects on our part and after the recognition of revenue based on our estimate of the clients ultimate financial recovery  made various decisions that significantly reduced the prospects for such recovery 
these decisions included narrowing the scope of the completed project  implementing additional requirements prior to seeking reimbursement and  for public policy reasons in some cases  foregoing recovery of amounts otherwise reimbursable to the state agencies 
the agencies took these actions over time  and it was not until the end of fiscal that it became evident that the entire million of accounts receivable would not be realized 
as a result of the implementation of sab  we were required to report in subsequent periods the amount of revenue if material to income before income taxes recognized in those periods that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
our footnote disclosure in our previously issued financial statements subsequent to the change in revenue recognition policies did not properly distinguish between amounts that were ultimately billed as revenue and amounts that were determined not to be collectable and accordingly not included in revenues 
we believe that this mistake had no effect on reported earnings or cash flows on the interim or annual periods subsequent to the adoption of sab discontinued operations 
in fiscal year  we sold health care microsystems  inc which operated as our decision support group dsg  and implemented a formal plan to close the payor systems group psg through an orderly wind down of its operations 
as these two businesses were previously presented as separate reportable segments and represented separate classes of customers and major businesses  the operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we principally recognize revenue for our service offerings when third party payors remit payment to our customers 
this policy is in effect because our fees are principally contingent upon our customers collections from third parties 
due to this revenue recognition policy  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of the timing of such collections by our customers and the fact that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed 
accounting for income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses for tax purposes during the five years prior to the year ended december  and were marginally profitable in the year ended december  after utilizing net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in  we have cumulative federal net operating loss carry forwards of million as of december  in addition to other items expensed for financial reporting purposes that were not currently deductible for tax purposes  these net operating loss carryforwards result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carry forwards before they expire 
the decrease in the valuation allowance from million in the prior year is principally attributable to the 
table of contents utilization in the current year of net operating loss carryforwards to offset current year taxable income 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that these estimates differ or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  for which a valuation is currently provided  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  which is net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill  representing the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
for the purposes of performing this impairment test  our business segments are our reporting units 
the fair values of those reporting units  to which goodwill has been assigned  is compared with their recorded values 
if recorded values are less than the fair values  no impairment is indicated 
since adoption  no impairment losses have been recorded 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets based on a projection of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the fair value of the asset 
for identifiable intangibles  we determine fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  such as bad debts  and restructuring charges 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
in particular  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  management has reviewed its estimates related to restructuring activities at december  and believes that the estimated liability is based on a reasonable assessment of the probable costs to be incurred 
as additional information becomes available  we may revise the estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential restructuring liabilities could materially impact the results of operation and financial position 

table of contents discontinued operations 
the accompanying financial statements are prepared using discontinued operations accounting for our discontinued dsg and psg businesses 
under discontinued operations accounting  amounts are accrued for estimates of our expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through their eventual discharge 
in july  we determined to proceed with an orderly closure of psg by accelerating a wind down of its remaining operations 
the dsg business was sold in december at december   there were no remaining liabilities of the discontinued operations 
any adjustments related to costs to be incurred during the close down or losses from operations have been reflected in and as discontinued operations 
in the event that any liabilities should arise from these discontinued operations  there could be a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be determined at this time because it will depend upon levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss income and net loss income per share pursuant to sfas no

the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
overview in general  our business is driven by the consistently rising costs of healthcare in the united states 
the nation s healthcare costs are expected to total trillion in  representing an increase of nearly since these costs seriously affect both healthcare payors and healthcare providers  creating demand for the services we offer through our two distinct operating subsidiaries  health management systems and accordis 
our work also is highly customized to the needs of each client  and to the specifications of individual projects 
each client engagement is unique  and requires significant up front investment  sometimes well before the engagement generates revenue 
ultimately  each project results in revenues and costs that must be carefully controlled 
we accomplish this by striving to minimize the lead time between project start up and revenue generation  and by adapting common core processes to the particular needs of our clients as efficiently as possible 
we also establish very specific operational metrics and profitability targets at the project level  which in turn roll up to create measurable financial objectives at the business unit level 
the following discussion goes into further depth regarding the macroeconomic considerations that drive our revenues 
the discussion of expenses then focuses on some of the factors that historically have determined the relationship between our revenues and costs 

table of contents revenue considerations revenue from our health management systems business  most of which is derived from contingent fees  has grown in tandem with the rise in expenditures for entitlement programs such as medicaid 
medicaid costs have grown by an average of approximately annually over the past several years  and similar growth is expected for years to come 
in addition  state governments have increasingly engaged vendors to provide coordination of benefits and cost containment services 
however  there is no certainty that health management systems will be successful in obtaining these contracts 
in addition  it is unclear what impact the increased scrutiny of entitlement programs and the ongoing debate about healthcare reform may have on health management systems revenues 
in the provider arena  hospitals face a steady increase in the cost of providing medical care even as reimbursement from governmental and other entitlement programs is under continuous scrutiny 
given this financial pressure  we expect that hospitals will continue to delegate various business office functions to accordis as a way of optimizing reimbursements and reducing costs for non core activities 
these activities include medicare bad debt recovery  disproportionate share claiming  and accounts receivable management  for which accordis has developed technology based solutions 
as we have seen in the past year  emergency medical transport providers are also increasingly outsourcing their billing and collections to specialists in order to improve cash flow and reduce administrative costs 
we expect this trend to continue 
as always  however  there are no assurances that accordis will be able to secure contracts for its services 
finally  it should be noted that the nature of our business sometimes leads to significant variations in revenue flow 
for example  since we receive contingency fees for nearly all our services  we recognize revenue only after our clients have received payment from a third party 
in addition  much of our work occurs on an annual or project specific basis  and does not necessarily recur monthly or quarterly  as our operating expenses do 
see a more detailed discussion in the risk factors section  below 
operating expenses as a service company  to of our operating expenses are compensation 
we adjust our employee headcount based on known business needs and expectations about the near term future 
based on recent operating results  we realize that compensation expense does tend to grow with increases in revenue although not on a proportional basis  since many employee functions do not require additional staff as revenue increases 
our revenue growth over the past several years has not resulted in significant changes in occupancy and data processing expenses 
these expenses are largely infrastructure costs  which typically would be affected only by extraordinary growth or decline in the business  or a dramatic change in our operational delivery model 
direct project expenses are incurred based on the requirements of each client engagement 
on average  these expenses have amounted to approximately to of revenues annually 
other operating expenses reflect the customary costs of doing business  such as insurance  legal fees  accounting and tax fees  and costs associated with the requirements of being a publicly traded company 
significant components of this expense category are costs of necessary external professional services  travel and entertainment  employee recruiting  training  and office materials 

table of contents years ended december  and continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs us attorney investigation costs total cost of services operating income net interest income income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income operating results aside from the discussion above regarding revenue fluctuations due to our revenue recognition policy and the project nature of some of our revenues  our operating expenses can increase based on discrete spending activities such as the legal fees and settlement charges we incurred in and related to the investigation by the united states attorney s office and in  the costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended december  health management systems  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily reflected million of revenue during the current year from two new state and one managed health plan clients and million related to the expansion of services for two existing clients 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client which we do not expect will recur in the current year or which did not exist in the prior year 
there were no client terminations during accordis  which provides outsourced business office services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this increase 
table of contents primarily consisted of million of revenue from seven new customers since the prior year period and a million increase with three customers resulting from expansions in the scope of services provided 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million associated with five terminated or inactive customer relationships 
effective november   our contract with george washington university hospital gw was terminated in connection with a decision by gw s parent to consolidate billing and collection activities in centralized billing offices 
this contract originally had been scheduled to end june  as a result of this early termination  the company and gw elected to accelerate the wind down of services 
accordingly  by december   all services to gw were completed and we closed our columbia  maryland office 
in  revenue and operating margin from the gw contract were million and million  respectively 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to prior year operating expenses of million 
the increased operating expenses in were principally due to the increases in revenue in both of the operating businesses 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this dollar increase resulted from higher headcount  general increases in compensation rates and the cost of employee benefits 
at december   we had employees  compared to employees at december  data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current fiscal year compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
the current year increase is primarily due to increased software costs 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  a decrease of million or from the prior year expense of million 
this net decrease reflects the full impact of subletting one floor at our new york city headquarters and reducing office space in our springfield  illinois office partially offset by nominal increases in rent and other occupancy expenses 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this increase reflects a million increase in expense related to health management systems partially offset by a million decrease in expense related to accordis 
the health management systems increase resulted from greater participation of subcontractors related to revenue composition and growth 
the accordis decrease was principally due to the reversal of million in bad debt expense due to the march settlement of two accounts receivable from the district of columbia which had been fully reserved previously  a net million reduction in subcontractor fees based on the particular mix of client engagements  and partially offsetting increases in temporary agency and subcontractor expenses of million associated with new business 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
this net increase resulted from million in expenses primarily for professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance partially offset by reductions of general corporate legal fees 
there were no restructuring costs in the current year  compared to million in the prior year  reflecting an additional charge associated with higher than estimated real estate taxes on sublet office space 
costs resulting from the united states attorney s investigation as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  a decrease of million or

operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year 
the accordis operating loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
health management systems had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year 
the decrease in the accordis operating loss largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increased compensation and direct costs expense as discussed above 
the increase in health management systems operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increased direct costs and compensation expense as discussed above 
in  we recognized income tax expense of  principally an alternative minimum tax liability resulting from our utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards to offset current taxable income 
in  we did not recognize any income tax expense or benefit against our net losses 
we have incurred significant taxable losses in prior years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carry forwards 
a recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of  in fiscal year compared with  in the prior year reflects an increase in market interest rates 
income from continuing operations was million in the current year compared with million in the prior year 
the million increase in income largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increases in operating expenses as discussed above 

table of contents years ended december  and continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs us attorney investigation costs total cost of services operating income loss net interest income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended december  health management systems  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily reflected million of revenue during the current year from two new state clients and million related to the expansion of services for an existing client 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client which we do not expect will recur in the current year or which did not exist in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue resulting from the termination of two client relationships in the prior year 
accordis  which provides outsourced business office services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily consisted of million of revenue from four new customers since the prior year period and a million increase with four customers resulting from an expansion in the scope of services provided 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
there was also a reduction in revenue of million associated with terminated or inactive customer relationships 
these decreases in revenue across the comparable client base and the decrease associated with terminated or inactive client relationships include an estimated permanent revenue loss in 
table of contents the second quarter of million attributable to processing delays and other impacts of the redirection of operational resources to regulatory matters 
see part i item legal proceedings 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to prior year operating expenses of million 
the increased operating expenses in were principally due to the increases in revenue in both of the operating businesses 
as discussed below in more detail  legal fees associated with our response to the subpoena from the united states attorney s office were substantially offset by several non recurring charges in compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this dollar increase resulted from general increases in compensation rates and the cost of employee benefits 
at december   we had employees  compared to employees at december  the current year headcount and related compensation expense reflects a shift to service center employees for the provision of business outsourcing services from higher paid information technology employees 
data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
the prior year costs included million associated with service development and system enhancement and reconfiguration activities that were terminated in the second quarter of  including a charge of million for the disposal and impairment of hardware and software items 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior year and for was million  a decrease of million or from the prior year expense of million 
this net decrease reflects subletting one floor at our new york city headquarters  partially offset by nominal increases in rent and other occupancy expenses 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this increase reflects a million increase in expense related to accordis  and a million increase in expense related to health management systems 
the accordis increase was principally due to increased subcontractor expenses of million and million of increased mailing costs partially offset by a million reduction in professional fees based on the particular mix of client engagements 
the increase related to health management systems is consistent with a increase in revenues 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
this net decrease resulted from a decrease of million primarily for consulting and professional service fees associated with a service development initiative and a system reconfiguration effort  both of which were terminated in the second quarter in  a decrease of million relating to expense in the prior year period related to certain stock option grants to members of the board of directors  and a reduction in all other expenses of million 
restructuring costs as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and in were million  a decrease of million from restructuring costs in reflect an million restructuring charge associated with reducing the amount of office space we occupy at our headquarters in new york city based on an executed sublease and an additional million in facility exit costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office 
in  restructuring charges reflect an additional million associated with higher than estimated real estate taxes on sublet office space 
costs resulting from the united states attorney s investigation as a percentage of revenue were or million in there were no similar costs in operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to an operating loss of million for the prior year 
the accordis operating loss was million for the year ended december  
table of contents compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
health management systems had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year 
the decrease in the accordis operating loss largely reflects several non recurring items in including million in expenses for service development initiatives and system enhancement and reconfiguration activities partially offset by the million in expenses primarily for legal fees associated with the investigation by the united states attorney s office 
the increase in health management systems operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue discussed above 
in and  we did not recognize any income tax benefit expense against our income loss from continuing operations or the income from discontinued operations 
we have incurred significant taxable losses the last several years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carry forwards 
a recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of million in fiscal year compared with million in the prior year reflects a shift to shorter term investments and a reduction in market interest rates 
income from continuing operations was million in compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
the million increase in income largely reflects the reduction of non recurring charges  restructuring charges  asset impairments and asset write offs during the current fiscal year discussed above as well as the effects of increased revenue  particularly in our health management systems business 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in part item business  note b and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of psg and dsg as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations in of million was principally attributable to a million termination fee which was not included in the original loss on disposal estimate for psg  a reduction in the estimated loss on disposal of psg of million based on actual operating results  and million resulting from the favorable resolution of certain dsg operating liabilities 
income from discontinued operations for psg in of million reflects the actual operating results for that period which were not previously included in the estimated loss on disposal estimate for psg 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of funds are operations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital were million and million  respectively 
although we expect that operating cash flows will be a primary source of liquidity  the current significant cash and short term investment balances and working capital position are also fundamental sources of liquidity and capital resource 
the current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances are more than sufficient to meet our short term funding needs that are not met by operating cash flows 
operating cash flows could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for our services 
our typical customer relationship  however  usually has a duration of several years  such that we do not expect any current decrease in demand 
we estimate that we will purchase approximately million of property and equipment during  which is consistent with the amount purchased in the current year 
the payments due by period for our contractual obligations  consisting principally of facility lease obligations and equipment rental and software license obligations  are as follows in thousands less than total one year years years after years operating leases 
table of contents we have entered into sublease arrangements for some of our facility obligations and expect to receive the following rental receipts in thousands less than total one year years years after years for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million compared with million for the prior year 
the current year cash provided by operations of million primarily results from million of net income plus depreciation and amortization charges of million  and an increase in current liabilities of million reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
during the current year  cash used in investing activities was million reflecting the net purchase of million in short term investments which was reclassified to short term investments from cash and cash equivalents  purchases of million for property and equipment  and a million investment in software 
inflation historically  inflation has not been a material factor affecting our revenue  and general operating expenses have been subject to normal inflationary pressure 
however  our business is labor intensive 
wages and other employee related expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the skilled labor market occur 
we also have a performance based bonus plan to foster retention of and incent certain employees 
risk factors private securities litigation reform act of safe harbor compliance statement for forward looking statements in passing the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act  congress encouraged public companies to make forward looking statements by creating a safe harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward looking statements 
we intend to qualify both our written and oral forward looking statements for protection under the reform act and any other similar safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements are defined by the reform act 
generally  forward looking statements include expressed expectations of future events and the assumptions on which the expressed expectations are based 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to those uncertainties and risks  prospective investors are urged not to place undue reliance on written or oral forward looking statements of the company 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise this safe harbor compliance statement for forward looking statements to reflect future developments 
in addition  we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time 
we provide the following risk factor disclosures in connection with our continuing effort to qualify our written and oral forward looking statements for the safe harbor protection of the reform act and any other similar safe harbor provisions 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the following 
table of contents our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to variability in the timing of when we recognize contingency fee revenue and other factors 
as a result  you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance our revenue and consequently our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of a number of factors  including the loss of customers due to consolidation in the healthcare industry  fluctuations in sales activity given our sales cycle of approximately three to eighteen months  and general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payors 
further  we have experienced fluctuations in our revenue of up to between reporting periods due to the timing of periodic revenue recovery projects and the timing and delays in third party payors adjudication of claims and ultimate payment to our clients where our fees are contingent upon such collections 
the extent to which future revenue fluctuations could occur due to these factors is not known and cannot be predicted 
as a consequence  our results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations and our results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed  and are based primarily on revenue and sales forecasts 
any inability on our part to reduce spending or to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or receive anticipated revenues could magnify the adverse impact of such events on our operating results 
we are subject to claims if our service offerings contain errors or experience failures or do not meet customer expectations and could lose customers and revenue the healthcare claiming environment is complex 
on behalf of our clients  our accordis business processes a very high volume of transactions in this environment 
from time to time  we have been subject to claims by clients and could be subject to claims by clients in the future for errors in our service offerings  primarily for failures to secure reimbursement amounts otherwise payable to our clients 
we have often resolved such claims by providing additional services to the client or by reducing fees on additional projects 
there can be no assurance that contractual limitations of our responsibility for damages will be effective in these situations or that clients will not seek significant damages for errors in our services 
further  these performance failures could result in a loss of customers and resulting loss of revenue 
in addition  service performance failures could result in a delay in market acceptance for our services  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation or increased service costs 
the majority of our contracts with customers may be terminated for convenience the majority of our contracts with customers are terminable upon short notice for the convenience of either party 
although to date none of our material contracts have ever been terminated under these provisions  we cannot assure you that a material contract will not be terminated for convenience in the future 
any termination of a material contract  if not replaced  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition for our services competition for our services is intense and is expected to increase 
increased competition could result in reductions in our prices  gross margins and market share 
we compete with other providers of healthcare information management and data processing services  as well as healthcare consulting firms 
some competitors have formed business alliances with other competitors that may affect our ability to work with some potential customers 
in addition  if some of our competitors merge  a stronger competitor may emerge 
current and prospective customers also evaluate our capabilities against the merits of their existing information management and data processing systems and expertise 
major information management systems companies  including those specializing in the healthcare industry  that do not presently offer competing services may enter our markets 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources  and market recognition than we have 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  changes in customer requirements and changes in the political  economic or regulatory environment in the healthcare industry 
in addition  several of our competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their services than us 

table of contents simplification of the healthcare transfer payment process could reduce the need for our services the complexity of the healthcare transfer payment process  and our experience in offering services that improve the ability of our customers to recover incremental revenue through that process  have been contributing factors to the success our service offerings 
complexities of the healthcare transfer payment process include multiple payors  the coordination and utilization of clinical  operational  financial and or administrative review instituted by third party payors in an effort to control costs and manage care 
if the payment processes associated with the healthcare industry are simplified  the need for our services  or the price customers are willing to pay for our services  could be reduced 
we are subject to government regulation in our collections services the collection industry in the united states is regulated both at the federal and state level 
in addition to specific regulation regarding debts for healthcare services and among other collection regulations  the federal fair debt collection practices act ffdcpa regulates any person who regularly collects or attempts to collect  directly or indirectly  consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person 
the ffdcpa establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors  including the time  place and manner of such communications and places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt 
additionally  the ffdcpa contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors 
many states require that we be licensed as a debt collection company and we believe that we are currently hold applicable licenses from all states where required 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could result in the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our revenue and net income the healthcare industry in the united states is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
our services are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates  certain capital expenditures  and data confidentiality and privacy 
from time to time  certain proposals to reform the healthcare system have been considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for our clients 
healthcare organizations may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring their retention of service providers such as us 
see also part item business healthcare reform and regulatory matters for additional discussion on this topic 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our results of operations  financial condition or business 
recently  the general accounting office  an investigative arm of congress  added medicaid to its list of high risk programs 
according to the gao  states have used various financing schemes to generate excessive federal medicaid matching funds while their own share of expenditures has remained unchanged or decreased 
also on january   the united states senate finance committee chairman requested that the hhs  cms  and oig respond to a lengthy request for information about vendors that provide contingency fee based revenue maximizing or revenue enhancement services to state medicaid agencies specifically with the intent to increase federal medicaid reimbursement 
this type of service represents a very small portion of our health management systems  inc suite of offerings and corresponding revenue streams 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  this inquiry might have on our future results of operations  financial condition or business 

table of contents our business is subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations and violations of any of those regulations could result in significant penalties most of the services offered by our accordis business involve the billing and collection of healthcare claims 
these services require the interpretation and application of sometimes ambiguous reimbursement regulations under various government entitlement programs such as medicaid and medicare 
in addition  during the past several years  federal and state governments have placed an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in medicare  medicaid  and other health care programs 
violation of health care billing laws or regulations governing our services could result in the imposition of substantial civil or criminal penalties  including temporary or permanent exclusion from participation in government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid  and loss of customers 
the interpretation and application of the healthcare reimbursement rules to particular customer patient accounting environments involves judgment 
if a regulatory agency were to disagree with certain judgments we have made or will make in providing healthcare billing services to a customer we could be subject to penalties  or fines or other sanctions by regulators 
in addition  we could find it necessary to alter or eliminate some of our services 
certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts  which could depress the market price of our common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  which could adversely affect the voting power or  other rights of holders of our common stock 
in the event of issuance  preferred stock could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock  we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future 
in addition  our by laws provide for a classified board of directors  which could also have the effect of discouraging a change of control
