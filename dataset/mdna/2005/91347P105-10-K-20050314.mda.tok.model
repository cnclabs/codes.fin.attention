item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in the section below entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in a variety of flat panel display and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and commercial chemicals  technology development and evaluation agreements and license fees 
in the future  we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
we have incurred significant losses and will continue to do so until our oled technologies become more widely adopted by flat panel display manufacturers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding o the timing of our receipt of license fees and fees for future technology development and evaluation  o the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  o the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and o the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may  under different assumptions and conditions  differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenues represent reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenues associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we also receive non refundable advance payments under certain of our development and technology evaluation agreements 
these payments are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party 
if a license agreement is executed  these revenues will be recorded over the expected life of the licensed technology  otherwise  they will be recorded at the time negotiations with the other party show no further likelihood of success 
if we estimate differently the expected life of this licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period will differ 
to date  no deferred license fees have been recognized as revenue 
as of december    was recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty revenue is received from ovpd equipment sold under a development and license agreement with aixtron ag 
revenue is recognized upon notification of equipment sold and royalties due from aixtron ag 
valuation of acquired technology we regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of these technologies may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
as of december   we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for  nor was such a revision needed in or if such a write down is required in the future  it could be for up to  the net book value of our acquired technology as of december  valuation of stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which no compensation cost is recognized for options issued to employees at fair market value on the date of grant 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
sfas no 
requires that a company s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for the plan 
we account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
sfas no 
and eitf require that we account for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of making the disclosure required by sfas no 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to o increased contract revenues by  o an increase in interest income of  and income tax benefit of  o and a decrease in deemed dividends of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase in was primarily due to o our commencement of work under seven new or continuing government contracts  and o final billings on two phase i contracts and one subcontract 
in  contract revenue was derived from eight government contracts  three of which were completed by the second quarter of and one which commenced in the third quarter of we earned  from our sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  for corresponding sales in the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our technology development and evaluation partners 
we commenced sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in our commercial chemical revenue and license fees for were  and  respectively  compared to  and  for the corresponding period in the increase was due to continued and expanded sales of one of our proprietary pholed materials to a customer for use in the exterior sub display of a mobile phone being sold in japan 
we recorded royalty revenue of  in from sales of ovpd equipment by the exclusive licensee of our ovpd technology  aixtron ag 
we had no corresponding royalty revenue in we recognized  in technology development revenue in in connection with two technology development and evaluation agreements  one of which was executed in october and the other in september  compared to  in the latter of these two agreements  which represented  of the  in  expired in accordance with its terms at the end of march the amount and timing of our receipt of fees fir technology development services is difficult to predict due to the early stage of the oled industry 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease of  in charges in connection with our development and license agreement with ppg industries see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  offset in part by an increase in additional employees  salary increases and patent legal costs 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to o increased salaries in connection with accruals for year end stock bonuses  and o increased costs as a result of stock issuances to members of the board of directors for board and committee service 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this was the result of increased cash balances from our august and march registered offerings of common stock 
during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  for the sale of these nols and recorded it as an income tax benefit 
deemed dividends were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  in  we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock and completed an offering that were deemed dilutive under the terms of a warrant we had previously issued and resulted in the reduction of the exercise price of that warrant and an increase in the number of shares issuable under that warrant 
we treated this occurrence as a deemed dividend of  in  we recorded a deemed dividend in the amount of  for similar reasons 
in september  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock we issued to motorola  inc in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for that stock 
we accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature cbcf 
as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  in september  we recorded a deemed dividend in the amount of  for similar reasons 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss attributable to holders of our common stock was primarily due to o an increase in total revenue  as described below  and o a decrease in non cash expense relating to the debt conversion and extinguishment of convertible promissory notes we issued in august  as well as a decrease in non cash interest expense see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to o additional payments under technology development and evaluation agreements and additional purchases of materials by our development partners  and o the provision of oled material to a customer for its use in the manufacture of commercial oled displays under an arrangement entered into in we earned  from sales of our oled materials for evaluation purposes for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our current development partners 
we entered into an arrangement in the third quarter of under which we began supplying one of our proprietary oled materials to a customer for use in the manufacture of commercial passive matrix oled displays 
as a result  we earned  in commercial chemical revenue and  in license fees in connection with this arrangement for the year ended december  there were no such arrangements in effect during we recognized  in technology development revenue for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase related to new and continuing technology development and evaluation agreements in we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the dollar value and the number of our government contracts remained relatively constant during and  and several of these contracts are expected to continue into we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o an increase of  in non cash operating expense associated with our development and license agreement with ppg industries  due to the increased market price of our common stock  o an increase of  in costs associated with the increased number of patents we filed in as compared to  o an increase of  in costs for the further development and operation of our facility in ewing  new jersey  and o stock performance bonuses of  to research and development employees 
no such bonuses were awarded in the increase was offset by a  decrease in costs associated with our scientific advisory board sab  due to the timing of payments to members of our sab 
we incurred general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from an increase of  in costs associated with new and existing personnel and with employee stock performance bonus awards of  there were no such stock performance bonus awards issued in in september   of the  in convertible promissory notes that we had issued in august the notes were converted into shares of our common stock  with the remaining amount being repaid in cash 
as of the date of conversion and repayment  the  face value of the notes exceeded their then carrying value due to an unamortized original issuance discount oid and beneficial conversion feature bcf on the notes 
as a result  upon the conversion and repayment of the notes  we recognized a non cash debt conversion and extinguishment expense of  related to the unamortized portion of the oid and bcf and the intrinsic value of the notes repurchased 
during  there were no such expenses see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we had no interest expense for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the retirement and conversion of the notes in september and the fact that we incurred no new debt in this compares to  during which we recorded the amortization of oid and bcf of the notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock we issued to motorola  inc in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for that stock 
we accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature cbcf 
as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  in  the adjustment resulted in a deemed dividend of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  we completed an offering that was deemed dilutive under the terms of certain warrants we had previously issued and resulted in a reduction of the exercise prices of these warrants and an increase in the number of shares issuable under certain of these warrants 
we treated and recorded this occurrence as a deemed dividend in the amount of  no such deemed dividends were recorded in the weighted average anti dilution provisions of these warrants will be triggered in the future if we issue additional shares below the various exercise prices of these warrants 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of  was primarily due to an increase in funds from our offering of common stock in march  less cash used in operations and restricted cash that is being used as collateral on a loan we entered into in connection with acquiring the building and property at which our main facility is located 
cash used in operating activities was  in  as compared to  in the increase was mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable was  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase in receivables resulted from an increase in contract revenue and from our entering into a new joint development agreement in december for which we did not receive payment until after year end 
the latter also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue  however  it was offset by the recognition of revenue during on two technology development and evaluation agreements which were previously classified as deferred revenue 
in march  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in proceeds to us of  net of  in costs associated with completion of the offering 
in april  we sold an additional  shares of our common stock at per share to cover over allotments 
the sale of these shares resulted in proceeds to us of  net of  in associated costs 
working capital increased to  as of december   from working capital of  as of december  the net increase was due primarily to the completion of the march public offering of our common stock 
we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and enforcement of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations into we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that would enable us to offer  from time to time  up to  of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities  subject to market conditions and other factors 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain and maintain patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
for example  under our research agreement with princeton university  we are required to pay princeton university  per year through july there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap other obligations sponsored research obligation    minimum royalty obligation      year total      year under our amended license agreement with princeton university and the university of southern california  we are obligated to pay princeton university minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs  which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
sfas no 
is an amendment to apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provision of sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based compensation  which supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity investments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the impact on net earnings as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  from a historical perspective  is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r and will adopt it in  as required 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the following factors  as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected 
we have a history of losses and may never be profitable 
since inception  we have generated limited revenues while incurring significant losses 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and until such time  if ever  as we are able to achieve sufficient levels of revenue from the commercial exploitation of our oled technologies and materials to support our operations 
you should note  however  that o oled technologies may never be adopted for broad commercial usage  o markets for flat panel displays utilizing oled technologies may be limited  and o we may never generate sufficient revenues from the commercial exploitation of our oled technologies and materials to become profitable 
we may require additional funding in the future in order to continue our business 
our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
we may require additional funding in the future for the research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs 
when we need additional funds  such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot obtain more money when needed  our business might fail 
additionally  if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants or depositary shares  or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities  the issuance of these shares will dilute our then existing shareholders 
if our oled technologies and materials are not feasible for broad based product applications  we may never generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations 
our business strategy is to license our oled technologies and sell our oled materials to display manufacturers for incorporation into the flat panel display products that they sell 
consequently  our success depends on the ability and willingness of these manufactures to develop  manufacture and sell commercial flat panel display products integrating our technologies and materials 
before display manufacturers will agree to utilize our oled technologies and materials for wide scale commercial production  they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our oled technologies and materials are feasible for broad based product applications 
this  in turn  may require additional advances in our research and development efforts  as well as those of others  for applications in a number of areas  including o device reliability  o the development of oled materials with sufficient lifetimes  brightness and color coordinates for full color oled displays  and o issues related to scalability and cost effective fabrication technologies for product applications 
our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies  including  without limitation  unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products 
technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses 
if we cannot complete research and development of our oled technologies and materials successfully  or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our oled technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications  particularly after incurring significant expenditures  our business may fail 
even if our oled technologies are technically feasible  they may not be adopted by display manufacturers 
the potential size  timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us are uncertain at this time 
market acceptance of our oled technologies will depend  in part  upon these technologies providing benefits comparable to cathode ray tube  or crt  display and liquid crystal display  or lcd  technologies the current standard display technologies at an advantageous cost to manufacturers  and the adoption of products incorporating these technologies by consumers 
many potential licensees of our oled technologies manufacture flat panel displays utilizing competing technologies  and may  therefore  be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our oled technologies 
during the entire product development process for a new flat panel display product  we face the risk that our technology will fail to meet the manufacturer s technical  performance or cost requirements or will be replaced by a competing product or alternative technology 
for example  we are aware that some of our licensees and prospective licensees have entered into arrangements with our competitors regarding the development of competing technologies  including the potential production of polymer based oled displays 
even if we offer technologies that are satisfactory to a display manufacturer  the manufacturer may choose to delay or terminate its product development efforts for reasons unrelated to our technologies 
mass production of oled displays will require the availability of suitable manufacturing equipment  components and materials  many of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  there may be a number of other technologies that display manufacturers need to utilize to be used in conjunction with our oled technologies in order to bring oled displays and products containing them to the market 
thus  even if our oled technologies are a viable alternative to competing flat panel display technologies  if display manufacturers are unable to obtain access to this equipment and these components  materials and other technologies  they may not utilize our oled technologies 
there are numerous potential alternatives to oleds for flat panel displays  which may limit our ability to commercialize our oled technologies and materials 
the flat panel display market is currently  and will likely continue to be for some time  dominated by displays based on lcd technology 
numerous companies are making substantial investments in  and conducting research to improve characteristics of  lcds 
plasma and other competing flat panel display technologies have been  or are being  developed 
advances in lcd technology or any of these other technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies for flat panel displays  either of which could limit the potential market for flat panel displays utilizing our oled technologies and materials 
this  in turn  would cause display manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us  or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us 
other oled technologies may be more successful or cost effective than ours  which may limit the commercial adoption of our oled technologies and materials 
our competitors have developed oled technologies that differ from or compete with our oled technologies 
in particular  eastman kodak company s competing fluorescent oled technology  which entered the marketplace prior to ours  may become entrenched in the flat panel industry before our oled technologies have a chance to become widely utilized 
moreover  our competitors may succeed in developing new oled technologies that are more cost effective or have fewer display limitations than our oled technologies 
if our oled technologies  and particularly our phosphorescent oled technology  are unable to capture a substantial portion of the oled display market  our business strategy may fail 
many of our competitors have greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully against them 
the flat panel display industry is characterized by intense competition 
many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel and research capabilities than us 
because of these differences  we may never be able to compete successfully in the oled display market 
the flat panel display industry has historically experienced significant downturns  which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our oled technologies and materials 
because we do not sell any display products to consumers  our success depends upon the ability and continuing willingness of our display manufacturer licensees to market commercial products integrating our technologies and materials  and the widespread acceptance of those products 
any slowdown in the demand for our licensees products would adversely affect our royalty revenues and thus our business 
the markets for our display manufacturer licensees products are highly competitive  with pressure on prices and profit margins due largely to additional and growing capacity from flat panel display industry competitors 
success in the market for end user products that may integrate our oled technologies and materials also depends on factors beyond the control of our licensees and us  including the cyclical and seasonal nature of the end user markets that our licensees serve  as well as industry and general economic conditions 
the flat panel display industry has experienced significant periodic downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by lower product demand  production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices 
our business strategy is dependent on display manufacturers building and selling displays that incorporate our oled technologies and materials 
industry wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for flat panel displays  and oled displays in particular  could cause significant harm to our business 
if our research partners fail to make advances in their research  or if they terminate or elect not to renew their relationships with us  we might not succeed in commercializing our oled technologies and materials 
further advances in our oled technologies and materials depend  in part  on the success of the research and development work conducted by our research partners 
we cannot be certain that our research partners will make additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials 
moreover  although we fund oled technology research  the scope of and technical aspects of this research and the resources and efforts directed to this research are in large part subject to the control of our research partners 
our most significant research and development relationships are with princeton university and the university of southern california 
our research agreement with princeton university expires in july and both this agreement and our amended license agreement with princeton university and the university of southern california the agreement under which we license our key oled technology patents can be terminated for various reasons 
for example  the research agreement provides that if dr 
stephen r 
forrest  the principal investigator for our research program with princeton university  is unavailable to continue to serve in this capacity  because he is no longer associated with princeton university or for any other reason  and a successor acceptable to both us and princeton university is not available  princeton university has the right to terminate the research agreement without impacting the amended license agreement 
termination of the research agreement would negatively affect our ability to research  develop and commercialize our oled technologies and materials 
if we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with oled display manufacturers  our business strategy will fail 
our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high volume manufacturers of oled displays 
as of december   we had entered into only two such relationships  one with dupont displays  inc and one with tohoku pioneer corporation 
all of our other relationships with display manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our oled technologies and materials for possible use in commercial production 
some or all of these relationships may not succeed or  even if they are successful  may not result in the display manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us 
under our existing technology development and evaluation agreements  we are working with display manufacturers to incorporate our technologies into their products for the commercial production of oled displays 
however  these technology development and evaluation agreements typically last for limited periods of time  such that our relationships with the display manufacturers will expire unless they continually are renewed 
the display manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis 
in addition  we regularly continue working with display manufacturers evaluating our oled technologies and materials after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them 
should our relationships with the display manufacturers not continue or be renewed  our business would suffer 
our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships  or to maintain our existing technology development and evaluation relationships  may require us to make financial or other commitments 
we might not be able  for financial or other reasons  to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to do so may cause our business strategy to fail 
conflicts may arise with our licensees or joint development partners  resulting in renegotiation or termination of  or litigation related to  our agreements with them 
this would adversely affect our revenues 
conflicts could arise between us and our licensees or joint development partners as to royalty rates  milestone payments or other commercial terms 
similarly  we may disagree with our licensees or joint development partners as to which party owns or has the right to commercialize intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship or as to other non commercial terms 
if such a conflict were to arise  a licensee or joint development partner might attempt to compel renegotiation of certain terms of their agreement or terminate their agreement entirely  and we might lose the royalty revenues and other benefits of the agreement 
either we or the licensee or joint development partner might initiate litigation to determine commercial obligations  establish intellectual property rights or resolve other disputes under the agreement 
such litigation could be costly to us and require substantial attention of management 
if we were unsuccessful in such litigation  we could lose the commercial benefits of the agreement  be liable for other financial damages and suffer losses of intellectual property or other rights that are the subject of dispute 
any of these adverse outcomes could cause our business strategy to fail 
we rely solely on ppg industries to manufacture the oled materials we use and sell to display manufacturers 
our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary oled materials for our own use and for sale to display manufacturers 
our development and license agreement with ppg industries  inc provides us with a source for these materials for research  development and evaluation purposes  and our supply agreement with ppg industries provides us with a source for these materials for commercial purposes 
however  the development and license agreement is currently scheduled to expire at the end of and the supply agreement is currently scheduled to expire at the end of our inability to continue obtaining these oled materials from ppg industries or another source would have a material adverse effect on our revenues from sales of these materials  as well as on our ability to perform research and development work and to support those display manufacturers currently evaluating our oled technologies and materials for possible commercial use 
if we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection for our oled technologies and materials  our business will suffer 
the value of our oled technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection 
although we own or license many patents respecting our oled technologies and materials that have already been issued  there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained  or that any of these patents  once issued  will afford commercially significant protection for our oled technologies and materials  or will be found valid if challenged 
moreover  we have not obtained patent protection for some of our oled technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which oled displays or materials might be manufactured or sold 
in any event  the patent laws of other countries may differ from those of the united states as to the patentability of our oled technologies and materials and the degree of protection afforded 
the strength of our current intellectual property position results primarily from the essential nature of our fundamental patents covering phosphorescent oled devices and certain materials utilized in these devices 
these patents begin expiring in while we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications whose expiration dates extend and in the case of patent applications  will extend beyond  many of which are also of key importance in the oled industry  none are of an equally essential nature as our fundamental patents  and therefore our competitive position after may be less certain 
we may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights  or in international trade commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees 
in addition  we may have to participate in interference or reexamination proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  or in opposition  nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices  with respect to our patents or patent applications 
all of these actions would place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention 
moreover  if successful  these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key oled technologies and materials on which our business depends 
in addition  we rely in part on unpatented proprietary technology  and others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology 
to protect our trade secrets  know how and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  financial advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements 
these agreements may not ultimately provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of those trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
in particular  we may not be able to fully or adequately protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners 
if we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our technology  it will harm our business 
we or our licensees may incur substantial costs or lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent and other intellectual property rights 
there are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to oled technologies and materials  including eastman kodak company  cambridge display technology  fuji film co  ltd  canon  inc  pioneer corporation  semiconductor energy laboratories co 
and mitsubishi chemical corporation 
as a result  there may be issued patents or pending patent applications of third parties that would be infringed by the use of our oled technologies or materials  thus subjecting our licensees to possible suits for patent infringement in the future 
such lawsuits could result in our licensees being liable for damages or require our licensees to obtain additional licenses that could increase the cost of their products  which might have an adverse affect on their sales and thus our royalties or cause them to seek to renegotiate our royalty rates 
in addition  in the future we may assert our intellectual property rights by instituting legal proceedings against others 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in enforcing our patents in any lawsuits we may commence 
defendants in any litigation we may commence to enforce our patents may attempt to establish that our patents are invalid or are unenforceable 
thus  any patent litigation we commence could lead to a determination that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable 
if a third party succeeds in invalidating one or more of our patents  that party and others could compete more effectively against us 
our ability to derive licensing revenues from products or technologies covered by these patents could also be adversely affected 
whether our licensees are defending the assertion of third party intellectual property rights against their businesses arising as a result of the use of our technology  or we are asserting our own intellectual property rights against others  such litigation can be complex  costly  protracted and highly disruptive to our or our licensees business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
as a result  the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property litigation to which we or our licensees are subject could disrupt business operations  require the incurrence of substantial costs and subject us or our licensees to significant liabilities  each of which could severely harm our business 
plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief in addition to money damages 
any intellectual property litigation commenced against our licensees could force them to take actions that could be harmful to their business and thus to our royalties  including the following o stop selling their products that incorporate or otherwise use technology that contains our allegedly infringing intellectual property  o attempt to obtain a license to the relevant third party intellectual property  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  or o attempt to redesign their products to remove our allegedly infringing intellectual property to avoid infringement of the third party intellectual property 
if our licensees are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  they may be unable to manufacture and sell their products that incorporate our technology at a profit or at all 
furthermore  the measure of damages in intellectual property litigation can be complex  and is often subjective or uncertain 
if our licensees were to be found liable for infringement of proprietary rights of a third party  the amount of damages they might have to pay could be substantial and is difficult to predict 
decreased sales of our licensees products incorporating our technology would have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues under existing licenses 
any necessity to procure rights to the third party technology might cause our existing licensees to renegotiate the royalty terms of their license with us to compensate for this increase in their cost of production or  in certain cases  to terminate their license with us entirely 
were this renegotiation to occur  it would likely harm our ability to compete for new licensees and have an adverse effect on the terms of the royalty arrangements we could enter into with any new licensees 
as is commonplace in technology companies  we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies 
to the extent our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers  we may be subject to claims that such employees or we have  inadvertently or otherwise  used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims 
the costs associated with these actions or the loss of rights critical to our or our licensees business could negatively impact our revenues or cause our business to fail 
the us government has rights to our oled technologies that might prevent us from realizing the benefits of these technologies 
the us government  through various government agencies  has provided and continues to provide funding to us  princeton university and the university of southern california for research activities related to certain aspects of our oled technologies 
because we have been provided with this funding  the government has rights to these oled technologies that could restrict our ability to market them to the government for military and other applications  or to third parties for commercial applications 
moreover  if the government determines that we have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these oled technologies in any field of use in a reasonable time  the government could require us to grant licenses to other parties in that field of use 
any of these occurrences would limit our ability to obtain the full benefits of our oled technologies 
if we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow  our business might not succeed 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of senior management and other key personnel  and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to our employees 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our management or other key personnel 
additionally  competition for highly skilled technical  managerial and other personnel is intense 
we might not be able to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate the highly skilled managers and employees we need to be successful 
if we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  our business will suffer and might fail 
we can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of shareholders of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock 
for example  an issuance of shares of preferred stock could o adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders of our common stock  o make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  o discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  or o otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we have issued and outstanding  shares of series a nonconvertible preferred stock  all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of sherwin i 
seligsohn  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
our board of directors has authorized and issued other shares of preferred stock in the past none of which are currently outstanding and may do so again at any time in the future 
if the price of our common stock goes down  we may have to issue more shares than are presently anticipated to be issued under our agreement with ppg industries 
under our development and license agreement with ppg industries  we are required to issue to ppg industries shares of our common stock for services rendered by it 
the number of shares of common stock that we are required to deliver to ppg is determined based on a formula requiring that the lower the price of our common stock at and around the time of issuance  the greater the number of shares that we would be required to issue to ppg industries 
lower than anticipated market prices for our common stock  and correspondingly greater numbers of shares issuable to ppg industries  with a resulting increase in the number of shares available for public sale  could cause people to sell our common stock  including in short sales  which could drive down the price of our common stock  thus reducing its value and perhaps hindering our ability to raise additional funds in the future 
in addition  such an increase in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock would further dilute existing holders of this stock 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including takeover attempts 
our executive officers and directors  their respective affiliates and the adult children of sherwin seligsohn  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  beneficially own  as of march   approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
moreover  pine ridge financial inc and first investors holding co  inc  as successor to strong river investments  inc  assigned to our management their rights to vote the shares of our common stock they received or are entitled to receive upon conversion of warrants  notes and preferred stock issued in an august private placement transaction  of which warrants to purchase  shares remain outstanding as of march  accordingly  these shareholders and members of management may  as a practical matter  be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
because the vast majority of oled display manufacturers are located in the asia pacific region  we are subject to international operational  financial  legal and political risks which may negatively impact our operations 
many of our licensees and prospective licensees have a majority of their operations in countries other than the united states  particularly in the asia pacific region 
risks associated with our doing business outside of the united states include o compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  o legal uncertainties regarding taxes  tariffs  quotas  export controls  export licenses and other trade barriers  o economic instability in the countries of our licensees  causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our royalties  o political instability in the countries in which our licensees operate  particularly in south korea relating to its disputes with north korea and in taiwan relating to its disputes with china  o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could impair our ability to license our oled technologies and sell our oled materials  thereby harming our business 
the market price of our common stock might be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock might be highly volatile  as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies  particularly other small and emerging growth companies 
we have included a section in this report entitled market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters that contains a table indicating the high and low closing prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market for the periods indicated 
factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future o our expenses and operating results  o announcements by us or our competitors of technological developments  new product applications or license arrangements  and o other factors affecting the flat panel display and related industries in general 
our operating results may have significant period to period fluctuations  which would make it difficult to predict our future performance 
due to the current stage of commercialization of our oled technologies and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we and our licensees must achieve to be successful  our quarterly operating results will be difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indicator of our future performance at this time 
among other factors affecting our period to period results  our license and technology development fees often consist of large one time or annual payments  resulting in significant fluctuations in our revenues 
if  in some future period  our operating results or business outlook fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price would be likely to decline and investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the initial public offering price 
broad market  industry and global economic factors may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock 
the price of our common stock can be expected to decrease if o other shares of our common stock that are currently subject to restriction on sale become freely salable  whether through an effective registration statement or based on rule under the securities act of  as amended  or o we issue additional shares of our common stock that might be or become freely salable  including shares that would be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding warrants and options 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to finance further research and development and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which shareholders have purchased their shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments
