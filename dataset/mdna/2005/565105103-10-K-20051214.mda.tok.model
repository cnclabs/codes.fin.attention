sources of revenue we derive our revenue from product licenses software and data and services fees 
we also derive revenue from annual maintenance fees on both our software and data products 
we market our solutions through a worldwide network comprised of a direct sales organization  vars  systems integrators  distributors and oems 
revenues generated in the united states represented approximately of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended september  as of september   we had sales offices located internationally in canada  the united kingdom  germany  australia  spain  italy  sweden and the netherlands 
product revenue we earn product revenues from licensing our software and data products 
we license our software and data products primarily under perpetual licenses  and we offer maintenance on our software and data products under agreements that typically cover one year 
we recognize revenue from licensing of products to an end user when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the product has been delivered to the customer  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the revenue related to maintenance for software and data products is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which  in both cases  is typically one year 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms that extend beyond twelve months not to be fixed or determinable  and revenue is recognized for these arrangements when the fee becomes due within twelve months 
if collectibility is not considered probable for reasons other than ext ended payment terms  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
services revenue historically  we derived services revenue primarily from systems integration and custom application development  technical support arrangements and training 
since our acquisition of thompson site selection research  inc in january  we derive a significant portion of our services revenue from analytical services and business consulting services 
revenue from business consulting services  analytical services  and systems integration and custom application development is recognized as the services are performed and upon customer acceptance when required 
we recognize technical support revenue using the straight line method over the period that the support is provided  which is typically one year 
revenue from training arrangements is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue at september   we had deferred revenues of approximately million  primarily consisting of revenues related to post contract customer support  including maintenance for software and data products and technical support  which is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management evaluates these estimates  including those related to reserves for product returns  bad debts  and inventories  investments valuation  intangible assets and goodwill useful lives and impairment  provision for income taxes  reserves for restructuring  contingencies and litigation  on an on going basis 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
when the basis for carrying values of assets and liabilities are not apparent from other sources  they are determined from these estimates 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  an additional allowance may be recognized 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns is based on historical collections and sales returns experience 
we review the status of the current trade receivables  reserving amounts deemed to pose a material collection or sales return risk 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue earned on product and services arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
multiple element arrangements consist primarily of perpetual product licenses sold with year maintenance arrangements 
the maintenance arrangements are primarily sold separately from or as a premium to the product license fee and accordingly  vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is determinable 
the fair value used to allocate revenue to the elements is based on vsoe of fair values of the elements 
in general  r evenue related to postcontract customer support  including maintenance and technical support  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from customer training  business consulting services  analytical services and systems integration and custom application development is generally recognized when the service is performed 
impairment of intangible assets 
intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years  with the exception of certain trademarks  which have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and therefore are not subject to amortization 
we review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when a triggering event occurs and write down the asset if it is determined that the asset has been impaired 
management s determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is 
table of contents considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairment 
effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when a triggering event occurs and write down goodwill if it is determined that the asset has been impaired 
management s determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
deferred tax assets 
at september   we had net deferred tax assets of million  reflecting tax credit carryforwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which reduce taxable income in future years 
we are required to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets 
significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments in future periods 
our future tax benefits related to capital losses are fully reserved as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized due to their relatively short carryforward periods 
although realization is not assured  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized principally based upon forecasted taxable income generally within the ten year foreign tax credit  the twenty year research and development credit and net operating loss carryforward periods  giving consideration to the substantial benefits realized to date through our restructuring pr ogram and successful growth 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets actually realized could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income 
if our forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions or improvement in our results of operations does not continue  our long term forecast will require reassessment 
as a result  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
contingencies and litigation 
certain conditions may exist as of the date of the financial statements  which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities  and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment 
in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings  the company s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein 
if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated  then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company s financial statements 
if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible  or is probable but cannot be estimated  then the nature of the contingent liability  together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material  would be disclosed 
loss contingencies considered remote are generally not accrued or disclosed unless they involve guarantees  in which case the guarantees would be disclosed

the company s preliminary estimate is that this expense will reduce net income by approximately million to million in fiscal year factors affecting future performance in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors and risks  among others  could affect our future performance and should be considered in evaluating our outlook 
we may never realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and investments 
we have made a number of acquisitions and investments  including our august acquisition of dimasi strategic research  our june acquisition of marketech systems  inc  our february acquisition of geobusiness solutions limited  our september acquisition of southbank systems limited  and our january acquisition of thompson site selection research  inc a key part of our growth strategy is to engage in acquisitions  therefore  we continue to review future acquisition and investment opportunities 
we cannot assure you that acquisition candidates will continue to be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to possible decreases in capital resources or dilution to existing stockholders  difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition and the subsequent assimilation of the operations and the services or products of an acquired company  the difficulties of operating a new business  potential inherited liability for the past actions of an acquired company  
table of contents the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  a limited ability to predict future operating results of an acquired business  and the potential loss of key employees and customers of an acquired company 
in the event that the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations  we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business  including goodwill 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will be successfully integrated into our operations or will have the intended financial or strategic results 
consolidations in the telecommunications industry may adversely impact our business 
the telecommunications industry has recently experienced significant consolidation and this trend is expected to continue 
these consolidations could result in delays in purchasing decisions by the merged companies and or reduced demand for our products and services to the merged companies 
as a result  our revenues from the telecommunications vertical market could continue to be increasingly dependent on a smaller number of telecommunications companies 
the loss of  or a decreased role with  a significant customer due to industry consolidation may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
our business is exposed to the risks inherent in our international operations 
revenues outside the united states represented approximately of our revenues in fiscal year the international portion of our business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including difficulties in building and managing international operations  reliance on financial commitments from certain international distributors  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into foreign languages  fluctuations in import export duties and quotas  potentially adverse tax consequences  and regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
in addition  we have historically experienced increased credit risk in some of our international markets 
our operating results are also affected by changes in exchange rates and limitations on the repatriation of funds 
approximately of our revenues in fiscal year were denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in international business conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to successfully execute on our strategic plan to increasingly focus on vertical markets 
our increasing focus on vertical markets such as telecommunications  retail  the public sector  and financial services  which includes insurance and retail banking  is an integral part of our overall strategic plan 
opportunities in these markets are hard to predict 
for example  our ability to earn revenues from sales to the us government is affected by factors outside of our control  including the government s ability to terminate its contracts with us  the complex and time consuming process for procuring government contracts as well as the requirement that we comply with various government regulations and policies 
in addition  our success and strategy depend on our ability to continue to develop domain expertise in our targeted vertical markets 
if customer demand does not grow as anticipated or our products and services are not accepted in these markets  our business and results of opera tions could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may be unable to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in our industry or to timely introduce new or enhanced products that achieve market acceptance 
our industry is characterized by extremely rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changing customer demands and frequent new product introductions 
these conditions require continuous expenditures on product research and development to enhance existing products  create new products and avoid product obsolescence 
we believe that the timely development of new products and continuing enhancements to existing products is essential to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace 
during recent years  we introduced a number of new or substantially updated releases of products  including routing j server  targetpro  envinsa  exponare  mapmarker and mapinfo discovery 
our future success depends in part upon customer and market acceptance of these new products and initiatives  which is uncertain 
any failure to achieve increased acceptance of these and other new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products in a timely manner or successfully manage transitions from one product release to the next 
we have incurred losses in past fiscal years  and we may incur losses in the future 
we reported losses for fiscal years and although we reported positive net income for the last two quarters of fiscal year  all four quarters of fiscal year  and all four quarters of fiscal year  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
to maintain profitability  we will have to generate significant revenues to offset our cost of revenues and our research and development  selling  marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our current customer base  increase our revenues and decrease our costs  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending upon factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and new versions of existing products  the ability to reduce expenses or increase revenues at a level sufficient to offset increases in expenses  the level of technology spending and the activities of our competitors 
because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  minor variations in the timing of orders and shipments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter results from software and data licenses issued in that quarter 
accordingly  our ability to accurately forecast future revenues and income for any period is necessarily limited 
also  we could experience reduced revenues in our targeted vertical marke ts as a result of decreased spending in those industries 
in addition  we typically derive a significant portion of our revenue each quarter from the orders we receive in the last month of the quarter 
we may be unable to adequately secure and protect our patent  trademark and other proprietary rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and the technologies we use to implement and operate our business in the united states and foreign countries 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret protections  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  patent rights and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products  reverse engineer or obtain and use information we regard as proprietary  and the scope or enforceability of our patent rights may be successfully challenged by third parties 
in addition  our shrink wrap licenses  under which we license our products  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
also  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
any misappropriation of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  and we cannot assure you that the measures we take to protect our proprietary rights are adequate 
claims that we infringe the proprietary rights of third parties could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products and services 
third parties may claim that our current or 
table of contents future products or services infringe their proprietary rights 
any infringement or other claim  whether with or without merit  would be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert our management s attention from our core business 
as a result of an infringement claim  we may have to pay significant damages  incur substantial legal fees  develop costly technology that does not infringe the rights of others  if possible  or enter into license agreements  which may require us to pay substantial royalties and may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
for example  one of our former resellers has made copyright infringement and other claims against us 
see part ii  item i legal proceedings for a description of this proceeding 
in addition  we have agreed in some of our agreements  including our shrink wrap end user licenses  to indemnify other parties for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the proprietary rights of others 
we may incur substantial indemnification obligations under these agreements if third parties make an infringement claim against the other parties to these agreements 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive 
we may be unable to successfully compete  which may decrease our market share and harm our operating results 
we encounter significant competition in the market for business mapping systems worldwide 
our competitors include environmental system research institute  the gis division of autodesk  claritas  buxton  and microsoft 
as we continue to expand into new vertical or geographical markets  we may encounter additional competitors 
many of our competitors have significant name recognition  as well as substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and production facilities  than we do 
future consolidation within this market may adversely impact our ability to compete 
increased competition may lead to pricing pressures that could reduce our gross margins 
prices of software in emea and asia are generally higher than in the americas to cover localization costs and higher costs of distrib ution 
these higher prices could decrease in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our market share or compete effectively in our industry 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees 
our continued success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  sales and marketing  executive and other personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
further  if we decide to change our equity based compensation plan strategy for future grants  our ability to retain existing employees and to attract qualified candidates could be affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
loss of key personnel or changes in management could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on third parties for a portion of our data 
the loss of access to this data would harm our business  and we could become subject to liability for the use or distribution of the data we receive from third parties 
we rely in part on independent developers for the development of specialized data products that use our software 
in some cases we rely on sole source suppliers for data 
failure by these independent developers to continue to develop such data products  or changes in the contractual arrangements with these independent developers  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may experience delays in finding and securing alternative suppliers in the event of the loss of any of these independent developers  especially sole source suppliers 
in addition  when we integrate and distribute information we obtain from third parties  we could become liable for such things as defamation  invasion of privacy  fraud  negligence  intellectual property infr ingement and product or service liability 
market  competitive and other factors could prevent us from selling our products or services at prices that yield an economic return to our stockholders 
future prices we are able to obtain for our products may decrease from previous levels depending upon market or competitive 
table of contents pressures or distribution channel factors 
any decrease could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our financial performance will suffer if we are unable to contain our cost of revenues 
the cost of our revenues varies with the mix of technology development and licensing fees  product revenues  services revenue and services utilization rates  as well as with the distribution channel mix and the success of our cost reduction measures 
changes in our revenue mix  including an increasing percentage of sales attributable to services which have lower margins associated with them  as well as changes in our distribution model  may increase the cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the future 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our distribution channels  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we primarily market and distribute our products in north america  europe and australia through a worldwide network comprised of a direct sales organization  vars  system integrators  distributors and oems 
in the rest of the asia pacific region  africa and latin america  our products are marketed and distributed through exclusive and non exclusive distribution relationships 
while we have contractual agreements with such resellers and distributors  we cannot control their continued performance 
in addition  some of our reseller and distributorship agreements permit the reseller or distributor to terminate its agreement with us at its election by giving us advance written notice 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current resellers and distributors  that the resellers and distributors will perform to our expectations or that we will be able to expand our di stribution channels by entering into arrangements with new resellers and distributors in our current markets or in new markets 
unfavorable economic conditions may affect the level of technology spending by our customers and the demand for our products and services 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for software products and related services  particularly within our target vertical markets 
because we sell our products and services primarily to customers in the public sector  retail  telecommunications  and financial services including insurance markets  our business depends on the overall economy and the economic and business conditions within these vertical markets 
for example in   and part of  the stock market decline and the broad economic slowdown affected the demand for software products and related services  lengthened sales cycles and decreased technology spending of many of our customers and potential customers  particularly in the united states 
these events could have a material effect on us in the future  including  without limitation  on our fut ure revenue and earnings 
in addition  in cases where we enter into product licensing agreements with our customers  since some of those agreements permit the customer to terminate its agreement with us at its election  any decrease in technology spending by these customers may result in termination of our agreements with them 
from time to time  we are or may be subject to litigation that could result in significant costs to us 
from time to time  we have been  and may continue to be  subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
litigation against us may include claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by us  claims for damages related to errors and defects in our products and services and other claims 
as a result  we could incur significant expenses to defend against these claims or we could have to pay substantial amounts of damages  which could materially harm our business and divert our management s attention from our core business 
we are currently involved in litigation with one of our former resellers 
that reseller has alleged claims based on  among other things  breach of contract and copyright infringement 
although we are vigorously defending against the claims of this reseller  we cannot assure you that we will prevail 
see part ii  item i legal proceedings for a further description of this proceeding 

table of contents our software products may contain defects or errors  which could decrease sales  injure our reputation or delay shipments of our products 
the software products that we develop are complex and must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers 
in addition  to keep pace with the rapid technological change in our industry and to avoid the obsolescence of our software products  we must quickly develop new products and enhancements to existing products 
because of this complexity and rapid development cycle  we cannot assure you that our software products are free of undetected errors  especially in newly released software products and new versions of existing software products 
if our software is not free of errors  this could result in litigation  fewer sales  increased product returns  damage to our reputation and an increase in service and warranty costs  which would adversely affect our business 
an impairment of the value of our investments or acquired intangible assets could significantly reduce our earnings 
we periodically review several items on our balance sheet for impairment and record an impairment charge if we determine that the value of our assets has been impaired 
during the quarter ended december   we wrote off the remaining value of our equity investment in alps 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of september   we had approximately million in goodwill  million in other intangible assets and thousand in investments 
we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with our acquisition of southbank in  and million in goodwill in connection with our acquisition of thompson in we periodically review these assets for impairment 
if we determine that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable  we would record an impairment charge against our results of operations 
such an impairment charge may be significant  and we are unable to predict the amount  if any  of potential future impairments 
in addition  if we engage in additional acquisitions  we may incur additional goodwill and intangible assets 
we may not be able to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future taxable income  if any 
as of september   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards 
these net operating loss carryforwards could reduce our taxable income in future years 
however  they are scheduled to expire at various dates beginning in  and we may not be able to fully use these net operating carryforwards to offset any future taxable income we may earn 
unauthorized access to our systems  an interruption of our services or a system failure would harm our business 
our operations depend in part on our ability to maintain our computer equipment and systems in effective working order 
unauthorized access or damage or interruption from fire  natural disaster  power loss  sabotage  network failure or similar events could halt or interrupt our operations 
although we have established procedures designed to prevent or address these events  we cannot assure you that our computer equipment and systems are not vulnerable to such an interruption 
we may require additional financing  and our future access to capital is uncertain 
developing new products and enhancements to existing products and providing technical  training and analytics services is very expensive 
in the course of our business  we incur significant costs of revenues and operating costs  such as research and development  general and administrative and selling and marketing expenses 
our current operations may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our future operations and our growth strategy or service our outstanding or future debt 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations and available financing  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
any financing activities we undertake  whether to fund acquisitions  operations  growth or otherwise  could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
additional debt financing could require us to pay a greater amount of interest and impose covenants that could impede our ability to manage our operations  raise additional capital  undertake acquisitions or other strategic 
table of contents transactions or pay dividends 
for example  our current credit facilities contain covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain certain debt ratios and restrict how we invest our cash and liquid assets 
any financing through the sale of stock would result in dilution to existing stockholders 
market volatility may affect our stock price  and the value of our common stock may experience sudden decreases 
there has been  and will likely continue to be  significant volatility in the market price of securities of technology companies  including ours 
these fluctuations can be unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
during the period from january  to september   the lowest and highest reported trading prices of our common stock on the nasdaq national market were and  respectively 
factors such as the following could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially announcements of new products by us or our competitors  litigation involving us  quarterly fluctuations in our financial results or other software companies financial results  shortfalls in our actual financial results compared to our guidance or results previously forecasted by stock market analysts  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  our stock repurchase program  the gain or loss of a significant customer  and general conditions in the software industry and conditions in the financial markets 
a decline in the market price of our common stock may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees  acquire other companies or businesses and raise capital 
in addition  stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly  which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware general corporation law may deter a change of our control  which may affect our stockholders 
certain provisions of our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include granting our board of directors the authority to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  limitations on our stockholders ability to call special meetings  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters to be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with certain persons who own or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions could adversely affect the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock and prevent stockholders from realizing a premium that they may receive in connection with a corporate takeover

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
we export products to diverse geographic locations 
most of our international revenues through subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies 
in total  the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar improved revenue by approximately million  or percentage points 
to date  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition 
our exposure is mitigated  in part  by the fact that we incur certain operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which revenues are denominated 
interest rate 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
a significant portion of our cash is invested in auction rate securities 
assuming an average investment level in auction rate investments of million which approximates the average amount invested in these securities during fiscal year  each percentage point decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a thousand decrease in annual investment income 
to date  interest rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in addition  we have an outstanding term loan under which we make principal payment of approximately thousand per month  plus monthly interest payments of libor plus 
the outstanding balance on this term loan as of september  was million 
to date  interest rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in order to reduce exposure to movements in interest rates  in january we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert our variable rate mortgage loan to a fixed rate 
the agreement involves the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payments over the year life of the mortgage loan 
the notional rate of million and the termination date of january  match the principal amount and maturity date of the mortgage loan 
the variable interest rate on the mortgage loan is the greater of or the sum of the day libor rate plus 
the interest rate swap has fixed the effective interest rate that we will pay at 
the interest rate is based on the assumption that the day libor rate plus is or higher  due to the interest rate minimum which applies to the mortgage 
the impact of the fluctuations in interest rates on the interest rate swap agreement will be naturally offset by the opposite impact on the related mortgage debt 
we account for this int erest rate swap in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at september   the fair value of the swap agreement  which represents the cash we would receive or pay to settle the agreement  was a receivable of thousand 
the current portion of thousand is included on the balance sheet under the caption other current assets and the long term portion of thousand is included under the caption investments and other assets 
at september   the fair value of the swap agreement was a payable of thousand 
the current portion of thousand is included on the september  balance sheet under the caption accrued liabilities and the long term portion of thousand is included under the caption other long term liabilities 
we record the payments or receipts on the agreement as adjustments to interest expense 
we recognized interest expense related to the swap agreement of thousand for fiscal year  thousand for fiscal year and thousand for fiscal year
