item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations and leasing of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
as of january  parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in eleven states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
as a result of job losses and over supply of office properties  vacancy rates increased nationally and in parkway s markets 
the office sector is beginning to recover from high vacancy rates due to an improving economy 
as of january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to as of october  and as of january  not included in the january  occupancy rate are signed leases totaling  square feet  which commence during the first through third quarters of and will raise our percentage leased to 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form lease and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have helped the company maintain occupancy around during a time when the national occupancy rate is approximately 
parkway projects occupancy ranging from to during for its office properties 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate  which today is often lower than the existing lease rate 
customer retention is increasingly important in controlling costs and preserving revenue 
customer retention 
keeping our existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great deal of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that we are in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with our customers and our stockholders 
over the past eight years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention for the year ending december  was compared to for the year ending december  in  customer retention was below the company s historical average primarily as a result of the loss of two major customers effective december  burlington industries  which occupied  square feet at north belt in houston  texas and skytel  a subsidiary of mci worldcom  inc worldcom  which occupied  square feet at the skytel centre in jackson  mississippi 
subsequent to december   parkway has leased approximately of the former burlington space at north belt to several customers including cal dive international  ecfmg  grant prideco and mmi 
this additional leasing has raised the occupancy at northbelt to 
also subsequent to december   the company renamed the skytel centre to city centre  signed leases which raise the city centre building occupancy to approximately and began the development of a million  space parking facility to accommodate building customers 
the largest lease at city centre was signed with forman perry watkins krutz tardy llp for  square feet  commencing upon completion of the improvements to the space between august and may forman perry will occupy the space through december   subject to certain termination rights beginning july the firm is consolidating employees from two buildings in jackson and will vacate approximately  square feet in one jackson place  another parkway owned asset 
the other large new customers at city centre include entergy mississippi  inc and ross yerger  which leased  and  square feet  respectively 
strategic planning 
for many years  parkway has been engaged in a process of strategic planning and goal setting 
the material goals and objectives of parkway s earlier strategic plans have been achieved  and benefited parkway s stockholders through increased ffo and dividend payments per share 
effective january   the company adopted a three year strategic plan referred to as value square value square 
this plan reflects the employees commitment to create value for its shareholders while holding firm to the core values as espoused in the parkway commitment to excellence 
the company plans to create value by venturing with best partners  asset recycling  leverage neutral growth  uncompromising focus on operations and providing an equity return to its shareholders that is greater than that of its peer group  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit office index 
equity return is defined as growth in funds from operations ffo per diluted share 
the highlights of and reflect the strategy set forth in value square as described below venture with best partners 
during and  we sold joint venture interests in six office properties 
parkway continues to evaluate its existing portfolio for joint venture candidates and anticipates joint venturing more properties  as well as purchasing new properties with the intention of joint venturing them 
asset recycling 
in  the company sold one office property  while maintaining a year non cancelable management contract  and a 
acre parcel of land 
using the proceeds from the joint ventures  property sales  stock offerings and bank lines of credit  parkway purchased four office buildings totaling million in and three office buildings totaling million in leverage neutral growth 
parkway began with a debt to total market capitalization of and operated and at an average of 
the decrease in debt to total market capitalization is a result of timing delays in reinvesting proceeds from joint ventures  asset sales and stock offerings in addition to a rising stock price 
the company anticipates that the debt to total market capitalization will average around for the three years of value square 
during  the company assumed one mortgage for million in connection with the citrus center purchase in orlando  closed four mortgages for approximately million  issued  common shares for a net million  redeemed  shares of series a preferred stock and issued million shares of series d preferred stock 
during  parkway assumed two mortgages totaling million in connection with the capital city plaza purchase in atlanta and the squaw peak corporate center purchase in phoenix and placed three mortgages totaling million 
as of december   the company s debt to total market capitalization ratio was as compared to as of september  and as of december  uncompromising focus on operations 
recognizing that in this difficult real estate environment  operating efficiently and consistently is more important than ever  parkway implemented the uncompromising focus on operations ufo program in the first quarter of  whereby parkway s customer advocate grades each property in all areas of consistency and high standards 
this is done in conjunction with the customer advocate interviews with each customer each year 
parkway continues to focus on the basics of our business customer retention  leasing  and controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures  to maintain our occupancy  all of which have the effect of maintaining and increasing net operating income 
equity returns to shareholders greater than the nareit office index 
parkway is two thirds of the way through the value square plan and achieved this financial goal for the first two years of the plan 
ffo growth for the first months of value square was 
for the company  which exceeded the ffo growth of the nareit office index by more than 
discretionary fund 
the company has begun efforts to form a discretionary fund  which would acquire office properties similar to those currently held in the portfolio 
the targeted size of the fund is million comprised of million in debt and million of equity 
the company may contribute approximately million to the equity of the fund 
targeted potential investors are institutions  pension funds  state retirement systems and endowments 
the company would generate additional economic returns through the asset  property and construction management fees and the leasing commissions 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to raise a fund  and even if it is successful  the economic benefits will most likely not be realized until or beyond 
financial condition comments are for the balance sheet dated december  compared to the balance sheet dated december  office and parking properties 
in  parkway continued the application of its strategy of operating and acquiring office properties  joint venturing interests in office assets  as well as liquidating non core assets and office assets that no longer meet the company s investment criteria and or the company has determined value will be maximized by selling 
during the year ended december   the company purchased three office properties  and sold a joint venture interest in three office properties 
total assets increased  and office and parking properties and parking development before depreciation increased  or

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 
in accordance with the company s three year strategic plan  value square  parkway is committed to forming joint ventures with best partners for the purpose of acquiring office assets in the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
we believe these investments result in a higher return on equity than owned assets 
parkway will operate  manage and lease the properties on a day to day basis  provide acquisition and construction management services to the joint venture  and receive fees for providing these services 
the joint venture partner will provide to of the joint venture capital  with parkway to provide the balance 
in  investment in unconsolidated joint ventures increased  or 
the primary reason for the increase is the result of parkway entering into a joint venture agreement with respect to three office properties 
see detailed information regarding the joint venture transaction under the caption joint ventures appearing in item business 
the joint venture transaction is summarized in the following table in thousands

note receivable from moore building associates lp 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  parkway began consolidating moore building associates lp mbalp effective january  accordingly  the note receivable from mbalp reported in the financial statements at december  in the amount of  has been eliminated in consolidation at december  interest  rents receivable and other assets 
interest  rents receivable and other assets increased  for the year ending december  the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in unamortized lease costs due to the purchase of office properties in and an increase in escrow bank account balances 
the increase in unamortized lease costs represents the portion of office property purchase prices allocated to lease costs 
in  the total purchase price allocated to lease costs was million 
the increase in escrow bank account balances of million is primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditure reserve requirements for mortgages assumed in connection with office property purchases 
intangible assets  net 
during  intangible assets net of related amortization increased  and was primarily attributable to the allocation of the purchase price of office property purchases to above market in place leases and the value of in place leases

additionally  in connection with the rubicon joint venture  intangible assets disposed totaled  parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to acquired tangible and intangible assets 
notes payable to banks 
notes payable to banks decreased  or for the year ending december  at december   notes payable to banks totaled  and resulted primarily from advances under bank lines of credit to purchase additional properties and to make improvements to office properties 
mortgage notes payable without recourse 
mortgage notes payable without recourse increased  or during the year ending december   as a result of the following in thousands increase decrease assumption of first mortgage on office property purchases placement of mortgage debt impact of consolidation of mbalp scheduled principal payments principal paid on early extinguishment of debt market value adjustment on reverse swap interest rate contract item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation financial condition purchases and improvements includes a description of mortgages assumed in connection with office property purchases 
on may  the company closed with a lender two non recourse first mortgages totaling  which were secured by two properties 
the mortgages are interest only in years one and two  have a fixed interest rate of with a year term and a year amortization 
proceeds from the mortgage were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s lines of credit 
the company expects to continue seeking fixed rate  non recourse mortgage financing with maturities from five to ten years typically amortizing over to years on select office building investments as additional capital is needed 
the company targets a debt to total market capitalization rate at a percentage in the mid s 
this rate may vary at times pending acquisitions  sales and or equity offerings 
in addition  volatility in the price of the company s common stock may affect the debt to total market capitalization ratio 
however  over time the company plans to maintain a percentage in the mid s 
in addition to this debt ratio  the company monitors interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the interest coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued  principal payments made on mortgage loans and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
the computation of the interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and the reconciliation of net income to ebitda are as follows for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income adjustments to net income interest expense amortization of financing costs prepayment expenses early extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred compensation gain on sale of joint venture interests and real estate tax expenses ebitda adjustments unconsolidated joint ventures ebitda adjustments minority interest in real estate partnerships ebitda interest coverage ratio ebitda interest expense interest expense capitalized interest interest expense unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense minority interest in real estate partnerships total interest expense interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends preferred distributions unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments excluding early extinguishment of debt principal payments unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments monitory interests in real estate partnerships total fixed charges fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  means operating income before mortgage and other interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors and parkway s management as an indication of the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity 
accounts payable and other liabilities 
during  accounts payable and other liabilities increased  the increase is primarily attributable to the allocation of office property purchase prices to below market in place leases in accordance with sfas which totaled  at december  subsidiary redeemable preferred membership interests 
in connection with the capital city plaza purchase  the limited liability company that owns the building issued million in preferred membership interests to the seller 
the preferred membership interests pay the seller a coupon rate and were issued to accommodate their tax planning needs 
the seller has the right to redeem million of the membership interests within six months of closing and million of the membership interests within nine months of closing 
parkway has the right to retire the preferred interest months after closing

critical accounting policies and estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc and its majority owned subsidiaries 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary  as defined in fasb interpretation r consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
real estate assets are classified as held for sale or held and used in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on the estimated and realizable contract sales price if available for the asset less estimated costs to sell 
if a sales price is not available  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset for the remaining useful life are used to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
the cash flow estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease in net income 
no impairment losses were recognized for the year ending december  or depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market leases  customer relationships  lease costs and the value of in place leases 
parkway allocates the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to tangible assets based on the relative fair value of those assets 
value is allocated to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar customers with similar terms 
the difference between the purchase price and the as if vacant value represents the fair value of the intangible assets or the intangible gap 
the intangible gap is then allocated among the identifiable intangible assets 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectibility of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure that enhances the comparability of our operations by adjusting net income for items not reflective of our principal and recurring operations 
this measure  along with cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities  provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
in addition  ffo has widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net income to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands  except per share data total dollar amount diluted per share year ended year ended december december net income adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization minority interest depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends convertible preferred dividends original issue costs redemption of preferred stock gain on real estate and joint venture interests amortization of deferred gains and other diluted share adjustment for convertible preferred stock funds from operations applicable to common shareholders inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
