item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
industry overview the solid waste industry is a local and highly competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and  to a lesser extent  the quality of service  and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable industry operators are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
executive overview we are an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly secondary markets in the western and southern us we also provide intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo containers in the pacific northwest through a network of six intermodal facilities 
we seek to avoid highly competitive  large urban markets and target markets where we can provide either non integrated or integrated solid waste services under exclusive arrangements  or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
our corporate wide theme for all employees in focused on execution and accountability 
the benefits of both our differentiated strategy and focus on employee execution and accountability were demonstrated in our results in operating results in february  we provided investors a financial outlook for which excluded the impact of any acquisitions that were completed during the year 
revenue in exceeded the high end of our initial expectations as internal growth averaged approximately during the year  and acquisitions closed during the year contributed an additional growth in revenue 
in  the margin benefits from operational improvements  customer price increases and increased internalization rates were more than offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions closed in late and during that had margins lower than our existing business  a loss on sale of assets  and higher costs primarily insurance  incentive compensation and fuel 
operating margins also declined due to increased depreciation  depletion and amortization costs associated with higher capital expenditures  increased internalization of waste into our landfills and amortization of intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we classified as discontinued operations the results of our georgia operations that were sold on december  all periods presented have been restated to present the results for these operations as discontinued operations  as well as the results of the previously sold operations in washington 
free cash flow free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  exceeded our initial expectations and reached a record level in we expected net cash provided from operating activities to be between and of revenue for the year and free cash flow  defined as net cash provided from operating activities plus cash proceeds from disposal of assets less capital expenditures and distributions to minority interest holders  to be between and of revenue 
in  net cash provided from operating activities and free cash flow  including the effect of discontinued operations  were and of revenues  respectively 
tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and bonus depreciation on qualified capital expenditures in the year were the primary reasons free cash flow results exceeded our initial expectations 
acquisitions we acquired approximately million of annualized revenue in to be attractive  acquisition candidates must be located in markets consistent with our growth strategy and satisfy our targeted financial returns 
while there remains a large number of acquisition candidates  our disciplined approach is somewhat opportunistic depending on when these more attractive candidates are available for sale 
in  we acquired solid waste companies in colorado  kansas  kentucky  minnesota  mississippi  nebraska  oklahoma  tennessee  texas  and washington  including a g certificate company in eastern washington 
we also completed a multi market asset swap with another publicly held solid waste company in which we sold our operations in georgia and acquired operations in the eastern tennessee and northern mississippi 
the transaction allowed both companies to expand and strengthen their respective positions in these markets 
we frequently evaluate potential asset swaps with other solid waste companies in order to improve our position in certain markets and increase potential returns on invested capital 
in november  we completed the acquisition of northwest container services  inc  or nwcs  an intermodal services provider in the pacific northwest 
nwcs existing business is benefiting from increased flow of cargo between the us and asia and the increased use by international shipping companies of less congested ports in the pacific northwest for point of entry rather than in southern california 
our decision to acquire nwcs was based on unique attributes of the solid waste disposal market in the pacific northwest 
we estimate that approximately million tons of solid waste are transported via rail from western parts of washington to competitor owned landfills in the eastern parts of washington and oregon 
longer term  we believe our ability to market both intermodal and disposal services will enable us to more effectively compete for a portion of this rail hauled waste disposal volume and dispose such waste into our existing landfill network in that region 
capital structure stockholders equity increased million and total debt decreased million during from year end to year end  debt as a percent of total capitalization declined from to  respectively  and debt to ebitda  as defined in our credit facility  declined from approximately x to x  respectively 
the improvement in our leverage ratios resulted in us having what we believe is one of the strongest balance sheets in the solid waste sector 
this improvement was due to our record free cash flow in the year  conversion into equity of million principal amount of our previously outstanding million convertible notes that were redeemed in april  and receipt of million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
stock buyback we maintain targeted total debt ratios between and of total capitalization and around x ebitda 
as a result of the significant changes in our capital structure during  our board of directors in may authorized a million common stock repurchase program over two years in an effort to rebalance our capital structure 
we believe our strong financial profile and operating performance provide us the flexibility to fund our acquisition program and repurchase stock while remaining under our targeted capital ratios 
during  we repurchased million of common stock and expect to repurchase million of additional stock under the program in  representing approximately of outstanding shares based on our stock price as of january  financial outlook the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s prospects and make informed investment decisions 
our outlook for reflects a full year of nwcs expected results and excludes the impact of any additional acquisitions that may be completed during the year and any new landfills that might be opened during the year 
our outlook also excludes the impact related to expensing of stock options and reclassification in the statement of cash flows of the tax benefit related to exercise of stock options under the fasb s statement r  which is effective for quarters beginning after june  we caution investors that our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  and consequently actual results for may differ materially from our current outlook 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current outlook are described in risks and uncertainties elsewhere in this report 
we undertake no obligation to update our outlook  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
revenue is estimated to range between million and million 
this assumes internal growth of approximately to  excluding the impact of commodities  with around from price and the remainder from volume 
intermodal services revenue is estimated at approximately million and is included in the range 
selling  general and administrative expense is estimated at approximately of revenue  subject to quarterly fluctuations 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is estimated at approximately of revenue  subject to quarterly fluctuations 
operating income is estimated at approximately of revenue  subject to quarterly fluctuations 
minority interest expense is estimated at approximately  subject to quarterly fluctuations 
effective tax rate is expected to be  subject to quarterly fluctuations 
net cash provided by operating activities is estimated to be between and of revenue  subject to quarterly fluctuations 
capital expenditures are estimated to be to million  or approximately of revenue  which includes an estimated to million for the construction of a new collection facility in pierce county  washington and permitting and partial construction of portions of three new landfills in existing markets 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the securities and exchange commission  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of the company 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
self insurance liabilities 
during  we increased our scope of high deductible insurance  adding automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims 
previously  our high deductible insurance program covered only automobile collision and employee group health claims 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 
accounting for landfills 
our adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in a significant change to our accounting policies for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
for additional information and analyses of the impact that adopting sfas no 
had on our balance sheet and our results of operations for the year ended december   see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of a landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and expansion airspace 
landfill closure and post closure liabilities are calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
the resulting closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with expansion airspace 
expansion airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
we accrue for estimated final capping  closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own  and certain landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site operating contracts 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
in  we calculated the net present value of our closure and post closure commitments assuming a inflation rate and a discount rate 
the resulting closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and expansion airspace  at the landfills that we own and at the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site operating contracts 
expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of expansion but is not actually permitted 
expansion airspace that meets certain internal criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
the internal criteria we use to determine when expansion airspace may be included as disposal capacity are as follows the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  which we either own or the property is under option  purchase  operating or other similar agreement  total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  internal or external personnel are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion 
for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues existing that could impair the success of the expansion  and the land where the expansion is being sought has the proper zoning or proper zoning can readily be obtained 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for expansion disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such case  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate acquired assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions  anticipated cash flows and operational performance of our acquired assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could reduce our net worth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our credit agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum net worth 
a substantial reduction in net worth could limit the amount that we can borrow under our credit agreement and any failure to comply with the agreement could result in an event of default under the credit agreement 
as of december   goodwill and intangible assets represented of our total assets 
allocation of acquisition purchase price 
we allocate acquisition purchase prices to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
we deem the total remaining permitted and expansion airspace of an acquired landfill to be a tangible asset 
therefore  for acquired landfills  we initially allocate the purchase price to identified intangible and tangible assets acquired  excluding landfill airspace  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
any residual amount is allocated to landfill airspace 
we often consummate single acquisitions that include a combination of collection operations and landfills 
for each separately identified collection operation and landfill acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills based on their relative fair values 
following this initial allocation  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each collection operation and landfill based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs  as discussed above 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either remitted or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
one method we use to estimate the fair value of solid waste companies is based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we determine the appropriate ebitda multiple to be used in the valuation of exchange transactions based on factors such as the size of the transaction  the type and location of markets serviced  the existence of long term contracts and the ebitda multiples we have paid in other similar cash based transactions 
in  we completed an exchange transaction in which we acquired operations of another solid waste company in tennessee and mississippi for our operations in georgia 
based on the ebitda multiple used to value the operations we disposed of  the pre tax gain on the disposal was  a change in the ebitda multiple used to value the operations we disposed of would have resulted in a pre tax gain or loss of approximately million 
general our solid waste revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing residential  commercial and industrial services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and all of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
more than of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from market areas where services are provided predominantly under exclusive franchise agreements  long term municipal contracts and g certificates 
g certificates grant us perpetual and exclusive collection rights in the covered areas 
contracts with counties and municipalities and governmental certificates provide relatively consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
since we bill most residential customers quarterly  subscription agreements also provide a stable source of revenues for us 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended december   and we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing their solid waste at the transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer station and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices of our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
our revenues from intermodal services consist mainly of fees we charge customers for the movement of cargo containers between our intermodal facilities 
we also generate revenue from the storage  maintenance and repair of cargo containers  and the sale or lease of containers and chassis 
the table below shows for the periods indicated our total reported revenues attributable to services provided 
year ended december  collection    disposal and transfer    intermodal  recycling and other    intercompany elimination    cost of operations includes labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle insurance  claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our significant costs of operations in were labor  third party disposal and transportation  cost of vehicle maintenance  taxes and fees and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workers compensation exposure  comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
during  we increased our scope of high deductible insurance  adding automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims 
previously  our high deductible insurance program covered only automobile collision and employee group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  bad debt expense  and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of equipment and fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and expansion airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of definite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
at december   we had less than million in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
we own undeveloped property in harper county  kansas  where we are seeking permits to construct and operate a municipal solid waste landfill 
in  we received a special use permit from harper county for zoning the landfill and in we received a draft permit from the kansas department of health and environment to construct and operate the landfill 
in july  the district court of harper county invalidated the previously issued zoning permit after it was challenged by a citizens group 
on august   the kansas court of appeals reversed the district court ruling and upheld the zoning permit 
the landfill opponents appealed this decision to the kansas supreme court  which denied the appeal on december   and ordered the district court to re instate the previously approved zoning permit 
we now are awaiting receipt of the final permit from the kansas department of health and environment to construct and operate the landfill 
at december   we had million of capitalized expenditures related to this landfill development project 
we believe we will receive the final permit 
if we do not receive the final permit  however  we will be required to expense in a future period the million of capitalized expenditures  less the recoverable value of the undeveloped property and other amounts recovered  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our reported income for that period 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
if any impairment indicators are present  a test of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
as of december   there have been no material adjustments to the carrying amounts of intangibles resulting from these evaluations 
additionally  we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually using the process prescribed in sfas no 
as a result of performing the tests for potential impairment  we determined that no impairment existed as of december  and therefore  there were no write downs to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented of total assets and of stockholders equity

total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  acquisitions closed subsequent to december   and the full period inclusion of revenues from acquisitions closed during the year ended december   increased revenues approximately million 
increases in recyclable commodity prices increased revenues by million  and increased prices charged to our customers and volume changes in our existing business resulted in a net revenue increase of million 
the volume increase was partially offset by the loss of certain municipal contracts that expired subsequent to december   and were not renewed 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to operating costs associated with acquisitions closed in the latter half of and subsequent to december   higher fuel costs  increased third party trucking costs associated with bringing waste to our owned or operated landfills  labor expenses and equipment maintenance costs associated with higher collection volumes  higher surety bond expenses associated with increased bonding requirements at our facilities and higher workers compensation and auto liability expenses due to an increase in claims volume  claim development and severity  partially offset by decreased landfill disposal costs resulting from increased waste internalization 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   increased percentage point to from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to companies acquired in the latter half of and subsequent to december  having operating margins below our company average  increased fuel costs and increased insurance costs  partially offset by a decrease in labor and disposal expenses associated with improved internalization and leveraging existing labor to service volume increases

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to depreciation and depletion associated with acquisitions closed in the latter half of and subsequent to december   increased depreciation expense resulting from new equipment acquired to support our base operations  increased amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in acquisitions closed in the latter half of and subsequent to december   and increased depletion expense resulting from higher volumes at our landfill operations 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues was the result of depreciation expense associated with new equipment acquired subsequent to december   and the full period inclusion of depreciation expense associated with new equipment acquired during the year ended december   which replaced older equipment with lower depreciation costs  and increased amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in acquisitions closed in the latter half of and subsequent to december loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets for the year ended december   increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million loss we realized on the sale of a corporate aircraft in operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues  partially offset by increased operating costs  recurring sg a expenses to support the revenue growth  increases in employee bonus and stock compensation expense  increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased losses on the sale of assets 
operating income as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december   was due to the aforementioned percentage of revenue increases in cost of operations  sg a expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses and the increased losses on the sale of assets 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to declines in our total outstanding debt balances and a decrease in the effective interest rate of our aggregate debt balance primarily due to the expiration of two interest rate swap agreements in late that required fixed interest payments in excess of our variable rate borrowing cost 
the decrease in our total outstanding debt balance was primarily due to the redemption of our million aggregate principal amount  convertible subordinated notes due  which resulted in the conversion of million of the outstanding note principal into our common stock  generation of free cash flow  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by additional borrowings to fund acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock 
other income expense 
other income and expense increased to an expense total of million for the year ended december   from an income total of million for the year ended december  other expense in the year ended december   primarily includes million of early redemption premium payments  the write off of a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of our million aggregate principal amount  convertible subordinated notes due and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of our million term loan prior to its maturity date 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in minority interests was due to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  these increases were due to increased pre tax earnings and an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was  an increase from for the year ended december  the increase in our effective tax rate was due to a decrease in in the dollar amount of expiring tax contingencies 
we analyze our tax contingency reserves quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the reserve 
loss on discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we sold all of our operations in georgia and one of our hauling operations in the state of washington 
the amounts recorded as losses on discontinued operations for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  consist of the net earnings for these operations  including a million gain on sale recorded for the year ended december  the income tax expense allocated to discontinued operations for the year ended december   includes million resulting from differences between the basis for tax and financial reporting of the net assets sold 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december   consisted of a million gain  net of tax effects  resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
on january  our adoption of sfas no 
required us to record a cumulative change in accounting for landfill closure and post closure obligations retroactively to the date of the acquisition of each landfill 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income and decreased interest expense  partially offset by increased minority interest expense  other expense and income tax expense 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues in the year ended december  from acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of revenues from businesses acquired in totaled approximately million of the increase 
of the remaining increase in revenues  million was attributable to selected price increases and million was due to improved recyclable commodity prices offset by a decline in volumes in our existing business of million 
the volume reductions were primarily the result of the inclusion of one time projects in and decreased volume at our transfer station in wichita  kansas 
revenue resulting from one time projects varies from year to year and generally is influenced by collection and disposal activities related to weather and other natural phenomena and the volume of construction activity in our markets 
the decreased volume at our transfer station in wichita  kansas was a permanent reduction in revenues resulting from a loss of volumes from a competitor who had temporarily used our transfer station in the prior year 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was mostly attributable to acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of operating costs from businesses acquired in exclusive of the impact of acquisitions  total cost of operations increased million due to increases in vehicle maintenance and insurance  offset by lower disposal expense driven by higher levels of internalization and lower labor costs 
the decline in labor costs in the base business was primarily attributable to the incurrence in of million of non recurring costs resulting from an employee labor strike at our facilities in pierce county  washington 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the incurrence in of million of non recurring costs resulting from an employee labor strike at our facilities in pierce county  washington and greater integration in of collection volumes into landfills we own or operate  partially offset by increased insurance costs 
sg a 
total sg a expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel from acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of sg a costs from businesses acquired in exclusive of the impact of acquisitions  sg a expenses were relatively unchanged

depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation expense associated primarily with acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of depreciation from businesses acquired in  additional intangible amortization resulting from acquisitions and increased depreciation in our base business 
the increased depreciation in our base business is primarily the result of capital expenditures running at levels significantly higher than depreciation 
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues resulted from the significant capital expenditures in as well as an increase in contract amortization associated with contracts acquired in operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues  partially offset by higher operating costs  and higher depreciation  amortization and sg a expenses 
operating income as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization offset partially by lower cost of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher debt levels incurred to fund our acquisitions  partially offset by a lower average borrowing cost 
additionally  the expiration of our two high rate interest rate swap agreements in december resulted in savings in the month of december of approximately million 
at december   we had million of net floating rate balances  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  our floating rate convertible subordinated notes due  various floating rate notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations  offset by our debt effectively fixed under interest rate swap agreements scheduled to commence in february should interest rates rise  our interest costs on these borrowings would increase 
for example  a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a million increase in interest expense 
other income expense 
other income and expense changed from an expense total of million for the year ended december   to an income total of million for the year ended december  the components of other income and expense consist primarily of gains and losses from non operational activities 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased pre tax earnings  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate due to the reversal of state tax liabilities associated with contingencies that expired in as well as an overall decline in our effective state tax rate due to changes in the apportionment of our earnings 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is above the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state and local taxes  partially offset by a reduction in our effective tax rate due to the reversal of tax liabilities associated with contingencies that were resolved in we analyze our tax reserves at least annually and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the reserve 
for example  if the statutory period for assessing tax on a given tax return or period lapses  the reserve associated with that period will be reduced 
income loss on discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we sold all of our operations in georgia and one of our hauling operations in the state of washington 
prior year results have been restated to reflect these operations as discontinued 
the amount recorded in income loss on discontinued operations for the years ended december  and of a loss of million and income of million  respectively  consists of the net earnings or losses for these operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december   consisted of a million gain  net of tax effects  resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
on january  our adoption of sfas no 
required us to record a cumulative change in accounting for landfill closure and post closure obligations retroactively to the date of the acquisition of each landfill 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income in  partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher minority interests 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development  landfill closure activities and intermodal facility construction in the future 
we plan to meet our capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds  debt and equity financings 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and equivalents of million 
our working capital deficit decreased million from million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
the decrease in our working capital deficit from the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable related to increased revenues  slightly offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments at year end 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  which included million used to fund working capital for the period 
the primary components of the reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   consist of non cash expenses including million of depreciation and amortization  million of minority interest expense  million of debt issuance cost amortization  million of tax benefit from stock option exercises  million from loss on sale of assets  and the deferral of million of income tax expense resulting from temporary differences between the recognition of income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes

other cash inflows from investing activities include million received from the disposal of assets and million of restricted cash in for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions and to pay a portion of acquisition costs that were included as a component of accrued liabilities at december  cash used for capital expenditures was million  which was primarily for investments in fixed assets  consisting of trucks  containers  other equipment and landfill development 
other cash inflows from investing activities include million received from the disposal of assets 
other cash outflows from investing activities include million of restricted cash funding in for our landfill closure and post closure obligations and million paid to acquire a interest in a company that issues surety bonds for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million  which included million of proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises  less million of net payments under our various debt arrangements  million of repurchases of our common stock  million of cash distributions to minority interest holders and million of debt issuance costs  primarily related to our amended credit facility 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  which included million of net borrowings under our various debt arrangements for the funding of capital expenditures and acquisitions and million of proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises  less million of cash distributions to minority interest holders and million of debt issuance costs  primarily related to our amended credit facility 
we made million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we expect to make capital expenditures of between to million in in connection with our existing business  depending on the construction timing for certain new landfills 
we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through existing cash  internally generated funds  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which fleet national bank acted as agent 
in october  we amended our credit facility to increase the maximum borrowings to million  consisting of a million senior secured revolving credit facility and a million senior secured term loan 
in march  the senior secured term loan was refinanced to increase the total borrowing to million 
in november  we refinanced our credit facility 
the new credit agreement amends and restates the old credit facility agreement in its entirety 
the new credit facility consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which bank of america  na formerly fleet national bank acts as agent 
the principal amount of the senior secured term loan under the old credit facility was repaid in full 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility as follows million was outstanding under our senior secured term loan and million was outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  exclusive of outstanding stand by letters of credit of million 
as of december   million was outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  exclusive of outstanding stand by letters of credit of million 
the million increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in was primarily due to funding new acquisitions  capital expenditures  redemption of a portion of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due april and stock repurchases  partially offset by using cash generated from operations and the proceeds from stock option exercises to repay borrowings 
the new senior secured revolving credit facility requires monthly interest payments and matures in october under the new credit facility  there is no maximum amount of stand by letters of credit that can be issued  however  the issuance of stand by letters of credit reduces the amount of total borrowings available 
the new credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee ranging from to of the unused portion of the new credit facility 
we are able to increase the maximum borrowings under the new credit agreement to million  provided that no event of default  as defined in the credit agreement  has occurred  but none of the existing lenders has any obligation to increase its commitment 
the borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin on base rate loans  or the eurodollar rate plus the applicable eurodollar margin on eurodollar loans 
the base rate for any day is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of a the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent and b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its prime rate 
the eurodollar rate is determined by the administrative agent pursuant to a formula in the credit agreement 
the applicable margins under the revolving credit facility vary depending on our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  and range from to for eurodollar loans and up to for base rate loans 
virtually all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and places certain business  financial and operating restrictions on us relating to  among other things  indebtedness  liens and other encumbrances  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  sale and leaseback transactions  and dividends  distributions and redemptions of capital stock  which restrictions are substantially the same as those contained in the old credit facility 
consistent with the old credit facility  the new credit agreement requires that we maintain specified financial ratios and balances and obtain the lenders approval of acquisitions in certain circumstances 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in our then outstanding credit facility 
we use the credit facility for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in certain circumstances 
in april  we sold million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due  or the notes 
the notes bear interest at the month libor rate plus basis points  payable quarterly 
the notes are unsecured and rank junior to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
upon the incurrence of certain conditions  the notes  when originally issued  were convertible into common stock at shares per  principal amount of notes  or per share 
in the third quarter of  we completed an exchange offer with respect to all of our notes 
through the exchange offer  we updated certain features of the old notes with terms that are now prevalent in the convertible note market 
these features include required subject to certain exceptions payment of the principal value in cash and net share settle of the conversion value in excess of the principal value of the notes upon conversion  and dividend protection provisions 
the dividend protection provisions provide a lowering of the conversion price if a dividend is issued while the notes are still outstanding 
the initial conversion price of the new notes remained the same as in the original notes at per share  which is equal to approximately shares per  in principal amount of new notes 
no other material terms of the notes  including maturity date and interest rate  were changed 
in april  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due april  or the notes 
in april  we redeemed the notes 
holders of the notes chose to convert a total of million principal amount of the notes into  shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share  or approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  plus cash in lieu of fractional shares 
we redeemed the balance of million principal amount of the notes with proceeds from our credit facility at a redemption price of  per  principal amount of the notes 
all holders of the notes also received accrued interest of per  principal amount of notes 
as a result of the redemption  the company recognized million of pre tax expense million net of taxes in april as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period less than recorded obligations total year to years to year s over years long term debt      total recorded obligations     long term debt payments include million in principal payments due related to our senior secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   our credit facility allowed us to borrow up to million 
holders of the floating rate convertible subordinated notes due may require the company to purchase their notes in cash at a price of par plus accrued interest  if any  upon a change in control of the company  as defined in the indenture  or  for the first time  on may  amount of commitment expiration per per iod less than unrecorded obligations total year to years to year s over years operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   total unrecorded obligations     we are party to operating lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these lease agreements and purchase obligations are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities and products at competitive  market driven prices 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we have obtained stand by letters of credit as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and financial surety bonds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these stand by letters of credit and financial surety bonds are generally obtained to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december   nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the minority interest holders of a majority owned subsidiary of waste connections have a currently exercisable option the put option to require waste connections to complete the acquisition of this majority owned subsidiary by purchasing their minority ownership interests for fair market value 
the put option calculates the fair market value of the subsidiary based on its current operating income before depreciation and amortization  as defined in the put option agreement 
the put option does not have a stated termination date 
at december   the minority interest holders pro rata share of the subsidiary s fair market value is estimated to be worth between million and million 
because the put is calculated at fair market value  no amounts have been accrued relative to the put option 
from time to time we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to us 
if we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance  we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations 
although we believe our operations would not be impaired by such dispositions  we could incur losses on them 
new accounting pronouncements for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
free cash flow we are providing free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  because it is widely used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in the solid waste industry 
this measure should be used in conjunction with gaap financial measures 
management uses free cash flow as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities plus cash proceeds from disposal of assets less capital expenditures and distributions to minority interest holders 
other companies may calculate free cash flow differently 
our free cash flow for the year ended december  and is calculated as follows for the year end december  net cash provided by operating activities   plus cash proceeds from disposal of assets   less capital expenditures   less distributions to minority interest holders   free cash flow   inflation to date  inflation has not materially affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business 
however  competitive pressures may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  especially if cost increases exceed the average rate of inflation 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 
seasonality based on historic trends  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
we expect the fluctuation in our revenues between our highest and lowest quarters to be approximately to 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall  winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in the us in addition  some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months 
adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities  resulting in higher labor and operational costs 
greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected waste  resulting in higher disposal costs  which are calculated on a per ton basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and prices of certain commodities 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
in may  we entered into two forward starting interest rate swap agreements 
each interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and effectively fixes the interest rate on the notional amount at interest rates ranging from to  plus applicable margin 
the effective date of the swap agreements was february and each swap agreement expires in february these interest rate swap agreements are effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt and we apply hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
in march  we entered into two additional three year interest rate swap agreements 
each interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and effectively fixed the interest rate on the notional amount at an interest rate of  plus applicable margin 
the effective date of the swap agreements was march and each swap agreement expires in march these interest rate swap agreements are effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt and we apply hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the net floating rate balances owed at december  and of million and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  our notes  various floating rate notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations  offset by our debt effectively fixed under interest rate swap agreements 
a one percent increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million and million  respectively 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
certain of our municipal recycling contracts in washington specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
although there can be no assurance of market recoveries  in the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices  a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the prices that were in effect at december  and would have had a million and million impact on revenues as of december  and  respectively
