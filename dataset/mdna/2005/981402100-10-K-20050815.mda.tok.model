overview we are a provider of services and web based software for human capital management hcm 
hcm is the process by which companies recruit  train  evaluate  motivate and retain their employees 
we offer software and services that address the needs of companies to more effectively manage their human capital management function 
we believe that our one stop shopping approach for our clients hcm needs is more efficient and effective than traditional methods of human resource management 
we have two distinct operating segments  which are the enterprise workforce services and career networks segments 
the enterprise workforce services segment primarily consists of hcm software and professional services 
specifically  our enterprise workforce services segment offers a complete suite of hcm software solutions  which address recruitment  benefits  performance  compensation and rewards 
the career networks segment consists of career transition services  recruitment research and applicant sourcing and exchange 
our business changed significantly beginning in fiscal during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of paula allen holdings  omnipartners  figurejobs 
com  rezlogic  resumexpress and tech engine 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of icarian  purecarbon and xylo 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of perform  peopleview and kadiri 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of peoplebonus  bravanta  hrsoft and proact 
these acquisitions have enabled us to expand and enhance our hcm software  increase our service offerings and increase our revenue streams 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we have concentrated on integrating the acquired entities  expanding the reach of the existing business and identifying other potential acquisition targets 
when we complete an acquisition  we combine the business of the acquired entity into the company s existing operations 
we expect that this will significantly reduce the administrative and other expenses associated with the business prior to the acquisition 
the acquired business is not maintained as a standalone business operation 
therefore  we do not separately account for the acquired business  including its profitability 
rather  it is included in one of our two distinct business segments and is evaluated as part of the entire segment 
furthermore  we do not assess the impact of individual acquisitions on earning trends 
to monitor our results of operations and financial condition  we review key financial information including net revenues  gross profit  earnings per share  and cash flow from operations 
as acquired entities are integrated and our business evolves  we continue to seek methods to more efficiently monitor and manage our business performance 
we review key operating metrics such as revenue per average number of employee  days of sales outstanding  liquidity ratio  and debt to equity ratio 
days of sales outstanding represents both the age  in terms of days  of a company s accounts receivable and the average time it takes to turn the receivables into cash 
it is calculated by dividing accounts receivables by daily revenue 
daily revenue is calculated by dividing revenue for the year by the number of days in the year 
liquidity ratio represents the number of times that current assets can cover current liabilities  and it is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities 
debt to equity ratio represents the level of debt in relation to shareholders equity measuring a company s financial leverage 
the ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by shareholders equity 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies relate to the assessment of goodwill impairment  the valuation of acquired intangible assets  the assessment of intangible asset impairment and the valuation of deferred tax assets and related allowances 
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the value of assets and the reported amounts of revenues 
changes in assumptions used would impact our financial position and results 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we assess goodwill related to reporting units for impairment and write down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
we estimate the fair value of each business unit by preparing a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate 
the model is prepared by projecting results for five years making different assumptions for each reporting unit 
for the calculation done at the end of fiscal  we estimated that individual reporting unit revenue growth rates would range from to  that gross profit would increase slightly  and that operating expenses would increase but would decrease as a percentage of revenues 
an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
changes in the discount rate used  or in other assumptions in the model  would result in wide fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
any such changes may result in additional impairment write downs 
we value acquired intangible assets  which includes acquired technologies  customer base and intellectual property  based on the estimated fair value of the assets at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated fair value is primarily based on projected cash flows associated with the assets and the customer attrition rates 
different assumptions were used in estimating the intangible assets acquired in each business acquisition 
if the future cash flows or the customer attrition rates differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to record an impairment of intangible assets 
changes in circumstances impacting other assumptions used to value intangible assets could also lead to future impairments 
we apply significant judgment in recording deferred tax assets  which primarily are the result of loss carry forwards of companies that we acquired and loss carry forwards internally generated 
in addition  we make certain assumptions about if and when these deferred tax assets will be utilized 
these determinations require estimates of future profits to be forecasted 
actual results may differ from amounts estimated

our enterprise workforce services revenue per average number of clients increased primarily due to the higher revenue generating clients associated with some of the acquired companies  specifically kadiri  bravanta and proact 
within career networks  the monthly average number of job postings in our applicant sourcing and exchange business remained fairly constant between fiscal and fiscal with an increase of less than

typically  employee costs will increase for a period of time after an acquisition until the appropriate downsizing occurs 
the majority of the downsizing benefit is anticipated to occur with the employee costs included in general and administrative expenses 
travel expense increased in fiscal primarily due to travel required before and after the acquisitions

we anticipate that we will continue to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part by issuing our common shares 
however  to the extent that we use cash to fund acquisitions  the amount of funds available to satisfy our working capital needs will be reduced 
we believe that these acquisitions have been important to our evolution from a recruitment application service provider into an hcm business process aggregator 
we believe that these additions will continue to broaden our revenue base and diversify our product offerings 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors that pertain to our company 
the realization of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  business or the market for our common shares 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address any of these risks or address them on a continuing basis 
keep these risk factors in mind when reading forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k 
see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in item we may not become profitable 
since our inception  we have incurred losses which have been substantial in relation to our operations 
as of may   we had an accumulated deficit of  we reported a net loss of  for the year ended may  fiscal and a net loss of  for the year ended may  fiscal 
revenues for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
our ability to reduce our losses will be adversely affected if we continue to acquire companies reporting losses  if revenue grows slower than we anticipate or if operating expenses exceed our expectations 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability would materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to grow as we expand our operations 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we made several acquisitions of other companies and businesses  as part of our efforts to expand our operations  and we may continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products and businesses 
the risks we may encounter in acquisitions include o difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  o difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  o potential exposure to product liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  o diversion of management time and attention and other resources  o loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management  o difficulty and expense of managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances  o our due diligence processes may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  and legal and financial contingencies  among other things  o potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  o the incurrence of amortization expenses  o possible future goodwill impairment if the financial results and subsequent forecasted financial results are lower than those estimated at the time of the acquisition  and o possible dilution to our shareholders 
in the past  we have acquired financially distressed businesses which had lost customers prior to our acquisition due in part to their financial instability 
while we are generally successful in retaining the remaining customers of these businesses after we acquire them  we may be unable to recover customers already lost by these financially distressed businesses 
we have also frequently used our common shares to pay the purchase price for acquisitions 
our common shares may not remain at a price at which they can be used for acquisitions without further diluting our existing shareholders  and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 
these difficulties may increase our expenses  and our ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected

the current economic downturn and future economic downturns may adversely affect the demand for our services 
historically  the general level of economic activity has significantly affected the demand for employment and recruitment services 
we believe that we are currently experiencing the effects of the current economic downturn and  as a result  the demand for our employment and recruitment services has decreased 
if the general level of economic activity continues to slow  our clients may not require additional personnel and may delay or cancel plans that involve recruiting new personnel using our services and technology 
consequently  the time from initial contact with a potential client to the time of sale could increase and the demand for our services could decline  resulting in a loss of revenue harming our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  it is expected that in times of economic growth  demand for our outplacement business may decline 
we may not be able to grow our client base and revenue because of competition we face 
our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to grow and maintain our client base and revenue 
this requires that we offer services that are superior to the services being offered by the competition that we face and that we price our services competitively 
the market for human capital management  or hcm  services is highly fragmented and competitive  with thousands of companies offering products or services that compete with one or more of the services that we offer 
we compete for a portion of employers recruiting budgets with many types of competitors  as employers typically utilize a variety of sources for recruiting  including o traditional offline recruiting firms  o traditional offline advertising  such as print media  o resume processing companies  o web based recruitment companies  o internet job posting companies  and o client server based software services 
in addition  many employers are developing or may develop their own software to satisfy their recruitment needs 
we also compete with traditional offline and web based outplacement service companies and human resource  or hr  service providers 
while we do not believe that any of our competitors offer the full suite of services that we provide  there are a number of companies that have products or services that compete with one or more of the services we provide 
for instance  companies that compete with our recruitment systems services include taleo corporation formerly recruitsoft  webhire and kenexa 
companies such as monster worldwide  execunet and netshare have products or services that compete with our applicant sourcing and exchange services 
we also compete with vendors of enterprise resource planning software  such as peoplesoft  oracle  sap and performaworks 
in the area of career transition services  we compete with companies such as mckenzie scott and wsa corp 
finally  companies such as lifecare  next jump and sparkfly compete with our employee portal services 
we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future  with increased price competition developing for our services 
a number of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical and marketing resources and name recognition than we do  which could give them a competitive advantage 
our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result  we may not be able to expand or maintain our market share and our ability to penetrate new markets may be adversely affected 
if we experience client attrition  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our enterprise workforce services clients generally enter into subscription agreements covering various periods  typically for one year or less 
we have no assurance that these clients will maintain a long term relationship with us 
if these clients fail to renew their subscriptions with us  our business  revenues  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
since we have only been offering our services for a limited period of time  we do not know what rate of client attrition to expect 
to the extent we experience significant client attrition  we must attract additional clients to maintain revenue 
we may not be able to strengthen and maintain awareness of our brand name 
we believe that our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully develop  strengthen and maintain the recognition and reputation of our workstream brand name 
in order to strengthen and maintain our workstream brand recognition and reputation  we invest and will need to continue to invest substantial resources in our marketing efforts and maintain high standards for actual and perceived quality  usefulness  reliability  security and ease of use of our services 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our workstream brand name  particularly after incurring significant expenses in promoting our workstream brand name  or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our workstream brand name  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common shares could decline 
moreover  even if we continue to provide quality service to our clients  factors outside of our control  including actions by organizations that are mistaken for us and factors generally affecting our industry  could affect our workstream brand and the perceived quality of our services 
our failure to enter into strategic relationships with third parties may harm our business 
if we are unable to enter into or maintain certain strategic relationships  our business will suffer 
these relationships generally include those with job posting boards and other on line recruitment services such as monster 
com and yahoo hotjobs pursuant to which our clients can post their job openings on such boards 
these relationships allow us to expand the services that we provide our clients without our having to spend significant capital resources developing or acquiring such services 
because many of these third parties compete with each other  the existence of a relationship with any particular third party may limit or preclude us from entering into a relationship with that third party s competitors 
in addition  some of the third parties with which we seek to enter into relationships may view us as a competitor and refuse to do business with us 
any loss of an existing relationship or failure to establish new relationships may adversely affect our ability to improve our services  offer an attractive service in the new markets that we enter  or expand the distribution of our services 
because we have international operations  we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 
beginning in  we completed several acquisitions of businesses in the united states and began marketing our services outside of canada 
we expect to continue to expand our us and canadian operations through acquisitions and to spend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete successfully in international markets 
our international operations are subject to certain risks  including o changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and trade barriers  o changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o the impact of recessions in economies outside of canada  o the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and any unexpected changes therein  o political or economic constraints on international trade or instability  and o fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we may lose business if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  services and features 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  services  or enhancements to  or new features for  existing products or services  in a timely and successful manner  we may lose sales opportunities 
the market for our services is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements  the introduction of new products and services  changes in client demands and evolving industry standards 
the adoption of new technologies or new industry standards may render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
the process of developing new services or technologies is complex and requires significant continuing efforts 
we may experience difficulties or funding shortages that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of enhancements or new products and services 
moreover  new products  services or features which we introduce may not adequately address the needs of the marketplace or achieve significant market acceptance 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including our ability to generate positive cash flow  cash required by future acquisitions  anticipated capital expenditures  the development of new services or technologies and our projected operations 
we believe that we have sufficient credit facilities  cash flow from operations and cash reserves  which  together with further cost reductions  will permit us to meet our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements through at least may  however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected in order to fund expansion  develop new  and enhance existing  services or acquire complementary businesses or technologies or if our revenues are less or our expenses are greater than we expect 
our ability to obtain financing depends on a number of factors  including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations  the amount of our cash reserves  the amount and terms of our existing debt arrangements  the availability of sufficient collateral and the prospects of our business 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to o keep up with technological advances  o pursue acquisition opportunities  o develop product enhancements  o make capital expenditures  o respond to business opportunities  o address competitive pressures or adverse industry developments  or o withstand economic or business downturns 
future financings may be on terms adverse to your interests 
in the past we have issued and  in the future we may issue equity to raise additional funds 
in july  we issued  common shares at per common share for a total of  in december  we issued  common shares at per share and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share resulting in aggregate proceeds of  if we issue additional securities  our existing shareholders may be further diluted and holders of those new securities may have dividend  liquidation  voting and other rights senior to those of the holders of our common shares 
the power of our board of directors to designate and issue shares of stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common shares 
we are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares  which may be issued by our board of directors for such consideration as they may consider sufficient without seeking shareholder approval 
the issuance of additional common shares in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current shareholders 
our articles of incorporation also authorize us to issue an unlimited number of class a preferred shares  the rights and preferences of which may be designated by our board of directors without shareholder approval 
the designation and issuance of class a preferred shares in the future could create additional securities that would have dividend  liquidation and voting preferences prior in right to the outstanding common shares 
these provisions could also impede a change of control 
if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company  our us shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences 
we believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes for fiscal years  and generally  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes if for any taxable year of our gross income is passive income  or at least of our assets are held for the production of  or produce  passive income 
this characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to our shareholders 
these consequences may include having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income  rather than capital gain income  and having potentially punitive interest charges apply to the proceeds of share sales 
us shareholders should consult with their own us tax advisors with respect to the us tax consequences of investing in our common shares 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technologies and brand names 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could provide third parties with access to our technologies without payment 
if this were to occur  our proprietary technologies would lose value and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  however  may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or protect us if misappropriation occurs 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because of the global nature of the internet 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
third parties could claim that we infringe upon their proprietary technologies 
our products  services  content and brand names may be found to infringe valid copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
in the event of a successful infringement claim against us and our failure or inability to modify our technologies or services  develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  we may not be able to offer our services 
any claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention  require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements  modify our technologies or services or prevent us from using important technologies or services  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation which could increase our costs of doing business  restrict our activities and or subject us to liability 
uncertainty and new regulations relating to the internet could increase our costs of doing business  prevent us from providing our services  slow the growth of the internet or subject us to liability  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and prospects 
in addition to new laws and regulations being adopted  existing laws may be applied to the internet 
there are currently few laws and regulations directly governing access to  or commerce on  the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and continues to change 
new and existing laws may cover issues which include o user privacy  o pricing controls  o consumer protection  o libel and defamation  o copyright and trademark protection  o characteristics and quality of services  o sales and other taxes  and o other claims based on the nature and control of internet materials 
the canadian federal government enacted privacy legislation which requires us to appoint an individual responsible for the administration of personal information  to implement policies and practices to protect personal information  to provide access to information and to deal with complaints 
we must obtain individual consents for each collection  use or retention of personal information 
we implemented procedures to comply with this new privacy legislation 
the privacy legislation increases our cost of doing business due to the administrative burden of these laws  restricts our activities in light of the consent requirement and potentially subjects us to monetary liability for breach of these laws 
computer viruses or software errors may disrupt our operations  subject us to a risk of loss and or expose us to liability 
computer viruses may cause our systems to incur delays or other service interruptions 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or software errors in new services or products not detected until after their release could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
moreover  if a computer virus affecting our system is highly publicized or if errors are detected in our software after it is released  our reputation and brand name could be materially damaged and we could lose clients 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of system failures 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures 
our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
if we are unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  we could experience unanticipated system disruptions and slower response times 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses and similar events 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
we have experienced delays in providing our customers access to their data in the past  and we believe these system interruptions will continue to occur from time to time in the future 
any catastrophic failure at our network operations center could prevent us from serving our clients for a number of days  or possibly weeks  and any failure of our internet service provider may adversely affect our network s performance 
most of our system interruptions are due to heavy internet traffic and minor equipment failures which generally result in our customers being unable to access their data for a few seconds or several minutes 
our clients may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them or results in slower response times 
our subscription agreements generally provide that our customers will be able to access their data during certain guaranteed times 
if we fail to meet the service levels specified under our subscription agreements as a result of repeated outages  the customer can terminate its agreement with us 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our system or interruptions in our services 
breaches of our network security could be costly 
if unauthorized persons penetrate our network security  they could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we may be required to spend capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate these problems 
in addition  because we host data for our clients  we may be liable to any of those clients that experience losses due to our security failures 
as a result  security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common shares may decline 
our business may be adversely affected if internet service providers fail to provide satisfactory service to our clients to enable them to use our services and access job seeker candidates on line 
failure of internet service providers or on line service providers to provide access to the internet to our clients and job seekers would prevent them from accessing our web board  which would cause our business to suffer 
many of the internet service providers  on line service providers and other web site operators on which we depend have experienced significant service slowdowns  malfunctions  outages and capacity limitations 
if users experience difficulties using our services due to the fault of third parties  our reputation and brand name could be harmed 
failure of the internet infrastructure to support current and future user activity may adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  greater frequency of use and increased bandwidth requirements of users 
in the past  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays 
the internet is also subject to actions of terrorists or hackers who may attempt to disrupt specific web sites or internet traffic generally 
any future outages or delays could affect the willingness of employers to use our on line recruitment offerings and of job seekers to post their resumes on the internet 
if any of these events occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may not expand and upgrade our systems and hardware in a timely manner in order to accommodate growth in our business  which could adversely affect our business 
we must expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware in order to accommodate growth in our business 
we may not plan any such expansion and upgrades in a timely manner to satisfy actual growth in our business 
if we do not expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware in a timely manner to accommodate any growth in our business  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
our common shares have traded at prices below and could be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq small cap market and the boston stock exchange 
under the nasdaq requirements  a stock can be delisted and not allowed to trade on the nasdaq if the closing bid price of the stock over a consecutive trading day period is less than 
the boston stock exchange  however  does not maintain a similar minimum price requirement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our common stock failed to meet the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement because the closing bid price for consecutive trading days was below 
in july  nasdaq gave us notice that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule because the closing bid price of our common shares had been or more for at least consecutive trading days 
no assurance can be given that the closing bid price of our common shares will continue to satisfy the nasdaq minimum bid price requirements and thus continue to trade on the nasdaq small cap market 
although our common shares may remain listed on the boston stock exchange  if our common shares are delisted from the nasdaq small cap market  there may be a limited market for our shares  trading our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease even further 
if our common shares are not listed on a national securities exchange or nasdaq  potential investors may be prohibited from or be less likely to purchase our common shares  limiting the trading market for our stock even further 
we may become subject to the sec s penny stock rules  which may decrease the liquidity of our common shares and negatively impact the ability of purchasers of our common shares to sell our common shares in the secondary market 
sec regulations generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
we are not currently subject to the penny stock rules because our common shares qualify for two separate exceptions to the sec s penny stock rules 
the first exception from the penny stock rules for which we qualify is an exception for companies that have an equity security that is quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
since our common shares are traded on the nasdaq small cap market  we are not subject to the penny stock rules 
the second exception from the penny stock rules for which we qualify is an exception for companies that have an average revenue of at least  for the last three years 
our revenue for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was   and  respectively  resulting in an average revenue of  if our common shares are delisted or removed from the nasdaq small cap market and if we fail to meet the average revenue exception to the penny stock rules  our common shares may become subject to the penny stock rules  which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common shares 
for transactions covered by these rules  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction prior to purchase 
in addition  unless an exception is available  the regulations require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it 
if our common shares were considered penny stock  the ability of broker dealers to sell our common shares and the ability of our shareholders to sell their securities in the secondary market would be limited 
as a result  the market liquidity for our common shares would be severely and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that trading in our securities will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future which would negatively affect the market for our common shares 
the price of our common shares historically has been volatile  which may make it more difficult for you to resell our common shares when you want at prices you find attractive 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile in the past  and may continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  since june   the closing sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq small cap market has fluctuated between and per share 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common shares o quarterly variations in our results of operations  o announcement of new products  product enhancements  joint ventures and other alliances by our competitors or us  o technological innovations by our competitors or us  o general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and o the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common shares  regardless of our operating performance 
see risk factor our common shares have traded at prices below and could be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
the use of performance based payment provisions in our acquisitions may result in costly legal proceedings 
we often require that a portion of the total purchase price in our acquisitions be contingent upon the acquired company s achievement of certain performance based milestones 
we believe that the use of contingent performance based payment provisions more closely matches the price we pay with the value we receive 
however  the use of these provisions has resulted and may continue to result in disputes over whether the performance based milestones have been achieved 
resolving these disputes could result in costly legal proceedings and divert management attention 
we depend on our key employees to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain our key employees  our business may be adversely affected 
our success depends on the efforts  abilities and expertise of our senior management and other key employees  including in particular  michael mullarkey  our president and chief executive officer  and stephen lerch  our executive vice president  chief operation and financial officer 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees 
if any of our key employees leave before suitable replacements are found  there could be an adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance that suitable replacements could be hired without incurring substantial additional costs  or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and our bank loans 
we invest our surplus cash in an investment trust established by a canadian chartered bank  and in a certificate of deposit in a bank in the united states 
the investment trust holds various short term  low risk instruments  and can be withdrawn without penalty at any time 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial position 
we have established a cdn  line of credit with a canadian bank which bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
we have drawn cdn  on this facility as of may  we can draw an additional cdn  before additional collateral would be required 
we also have a term loan with the bank in the amount of cdn  as of may  the term loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
additionally  we have two letters of credit issued in may as collateral on leased facilities in the amounts of  and cdn  we pay an annual fee of on these letters of credit 
the majority of our interest rates are variable  and  therefore  we have exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
however  management believes that the exposure is limited as the majority of the exposure is related to the cdn  line of credit  which is fully collateralized with our restricted cash and therefore can be liquidated immediately if faced with a rising interest rate environment 
the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended may  would have been less than foreign currency risk we have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the us dollar will impact our reported net asset position and net income or loss 
a change in foreign exchange rates would result in a change in our reported net asset position of approximately  and a change in the reported net loss for the year ended may  of approximately
