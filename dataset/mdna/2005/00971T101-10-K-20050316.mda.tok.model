item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily derive revenue from the sale of akamai services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functions our customers purchase 
at the same time  we must ensure that our expenses do not increase at the same rate as our revenue 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price  quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
see factors affecting future operating results elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our improved financial results in as compared to and reflect our improvements in our ability to increase our monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth 
the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenue  consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated revenues cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets restructuring benefits charges total cost and operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income  net loss on early extinguishment of debt gain loss on investments  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss we were profitable during the year ended december   the first full fiscal year during which we had net income 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the future during each quarter in  the dollar volume of the recurring revenue contracts that we booked exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations  terminations and non payment 
a continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues 
during  one customer  microsoft corporation  accounted for of our total revenues 
we expect to continue to do business with microsoft  however  we do not expect that revenues from microsoft will be more than of our total revenues in as our customer base continues to grow  we expect our customer concentration levels to decline 

table of contents during  revenues derived from customers located outside the united states were of our total revenues 
we expect that the revenue from such customers will be approximately of our total revenue in during  we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions in the market 
in  even though we delivered more traffic over our network than in previous years  overall bandwidth costs have continued to increase at a lower rate because we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit 
we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will increase slightly as a result of expected higher traffic levels offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing and we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in costs associated with depreciation of our long lived assets continued to decrease on a quarterly basis in due to these assets becoming fully depreciated 
due to purchases of new network equipment in and additional equipment purchases expected in  however  we expect that deprecation of our network equipment will begin to increase in amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  is expected to increase slightly as we continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings 
we expect a net decline in equity based compensation costs during the first and second quarter of as equity awards issued in previous years become fully vested 
the impact of new accounting guidance  sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  relates to the expensing of employee stock options 
sfas no 
r will be effective during the third quarter of and will require us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards at fair value 
when this requirement becomes effective  increased equity based compensation expense will cause our net income to decrease significantly in the future because we have a significant number of employee options outstanding and expect to continue to grant additional options and other equity based incentives in the future 
as of december   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
however  we will continue to review the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income as we expect to continue to generate income and positive cash flows during we will continue to review our operating results to determine when it becomes more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future  at which time we would release a portion  or all  of the valuation allowance 
any reduction in our valuation allowance in the future would result in a current income tax benefit  higher stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
in december and during the year ended december   we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in december and january  we issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes 
by lowering our effective interest rate on outstanding debt  we believe that  in the absence of new debt  the interest expense on our debt obligations  including deferred financing amortization and capital lease interest expense  will not exceed million in based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and events  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly basis during  however  our future results will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled factors affecting future operating results  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  maintain the prices we charge for our services  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and 
table of contents maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives 
recent events on march   we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common and preferred stock  including vested and unvested stock options  of speedera by issuing approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million based on the closing stock price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on march  the acquisition is expected to be accounted for by us under the purchase method of accounting and is expected to close during the quarter ended june   subject to various regulatory approvals 
the merger agreement provides for a stay of all existing litigation between speedera and us until the closing of the merger or any earlier termination of the merger agreement 
upon the closing  all lawsuits between speedera and us would be released 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  investments  capitalized internal use software costs  intangible assets  income and other taxes  useful lives of property and equipment  restructuring accruals and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make highly judgemental estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and requires us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check  financial review  the receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history with the customer 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all unpaid invoices to that customer and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
changes in our estimates and judgments of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
for these 
table of contents services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for that excess in the period of the usage 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
we periodically enter into multi element service arrangements 
when we enter into such arrangements  each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period  provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements 
for example  objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the element when sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period 
for most multi element service arrangements to date  the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable 
therefore  all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period 
we license software under perpetual and term license agreements 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
as prescribed by this guidance  we apply the residual method of accounting 
the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements  if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
we recognize revenue from fixed fee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentage of completion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts  and with the applicable guidance provided by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project 
in certain customer arrangements  we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract 
the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change 
at the outset of a fixed fee arrangement  if we are not able to estimate the total cost to complete  nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones  we account for the arrangement using the completed contract method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables 
in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed fee contract indicates a loss  we will record the loss immediately 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  deferred installation and activation set up fees  amounts billed under extended payment terms  and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue 
table of contents recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts  cash basis customers and service credits 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers where collection is no longer assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
the reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business  as well as for billing disputes 
these credits result in a reduction to revenues 
decreases to the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to customers which have a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve until we receive consistent payments 
we evaluate customer receivable balances and reserves on a monthly basis 
in addition  we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for service credits 
reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits 
these credits typically relate to management s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
concurrent transactions from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless both the fair values of our services delivered to the customer and of the vendor s product or service we receive can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable 
investments we periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is other than temporary 
we consider several factors that may trigger an other than temporary decline in value  such as the length of time the investment s value has been below carrying value and the financial results of the entity in which we invest 
when we conclude that the reduction is other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is other than temporary could increase loss on investments 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such a triggering event occurs  we compare the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations 
we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

table of contents restructuring liabilities related to facility leases when we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease  we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us 
in the latter case  we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease  the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken  and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan 
beginning in  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record restructuring liabilities  discounted at the appropriate rate  for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 
as of december   we had million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities 
in  we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates  resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of million 
we expect that approximately million of the amount accrued as of december  will be paid within months 
in the event that we are able to sublease our restructured space  we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
tax reserves and valuation allowance for deferred income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
we provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in past years 
despite our profitability in  as of december   we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit  an increase in total assets and stockholder s equity  and could have a significant impact on earnings in future periods 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if the project is an enhancement to previously developed software  we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus 
table of contents qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we must estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to an increase in service revenue of million  partially offset by a reduction in software and software related revenue of  the increase in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to an increase in service revenue of million  partially offset by a reduction in software and software related revenue of million and related party revenue of million 
service revenue  which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services  increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue was million for the year ended december  the increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts  as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and in an increase in the average revenue per customer 
we believe these increases are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers

in september  we entered into an amendment to our agreement with microsoft corporation to adjust the pricing and commitment levels 
in addition  we also amended the service level agreement guarantees applicable to the various services purchased by microsoft 
the term of the agreement runs until september but may be renewed by the parties 
microsoft will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by for extensions of the term of the agreement and convert the contract to a month to month term after september if the parties fail to reach agreement as to appropriate price and service level changes at such time 
software and software related revenue decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue was million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under long term contracts 
the decreases in software and software related revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects performed and a decrease in the number of software and other technology licenses executed as we focused on our core services business 
we do not expect software and software related revenue to increase as a percentage of revenue in we had no revenue from related parties during service and software revenue from related parties was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in revenue from related parties in as compared to was primarily attributable to revenue in from

in december and june  the joint ventures of akamai japan and akamai australia  respectively  were terminated 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in japan 
we do not expect to have any revenue from related parties in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for network operations personnel  cost of licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software costs 
cost of revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the total cost of revenues decrease for both periods is primarily a result of a decline in depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the depreciation from the recent investments we have made in our network infrastructure 
in  however  a portion of this decrease in deprecation expense was offset by an increase in total bandwidth costs as a result of higher traffic delivered 
traffic delivered over our network increased significantly in as compared to despite this increase in traffic  overall bandwidth costs have continued to increase at a lower rate because we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit 
cost of revenues decreased in as compared to by million primarily as a result of a reduction in depreciation of network equipment  lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic 
cost of revenues during  and also included credits received of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to monitor and reduce our network costs  however  the timing and amount of these credits  if any  will vary 
cost of revenues is comprised of the following in millions for the year ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage payroll and related costs of network operations personnel  including equity compensation cost of software licenses depreciation and impairment of network equipment and amortization of internal use software total cost of revenues we have long term commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and isps 
for the years ending december   and  the minimum commitments are approximately million   and  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in as compared to we expect that bandwidth costs will increase slightly as a result of higher expenses associated with increased traffic on our network offset by expected lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  we expect increases in depreciation of our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  as well as an increase in payroll and payroll related costs as we continue to make investments in our network

restructuring charges benefits 
we did not record any restructuring charges or benefits during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded net restructuring benefits of million as a result of amendments to certain lease agreements 
during the year ended december   we amended or terminated three long term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of million in cash and restricted cash 
as a result of amendments to  or terminations of  long term leases  we reversed million of previously recorded restructuring liabilities  offset by a restructuring charge of million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility located in europe 
the reversals represent the difference between the previously estimated restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the landlords thereof 
beginning in  our monthly rental payments have been reduced to a lower amount more aligned with current market rates 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million  which represents million for employee severance benefits and million attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments 
during the year ended december   in connection with the termination of our facility leases for and technology square in cambridge  massachusetts  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued 
also during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under non cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties 
in addition  we impaired leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  deposits  deferred rent and other long lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of million

we have estimated the 
table of contents amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors 
interest income 
interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest earned on notes receivable for stock 
interest income increased  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income for the year ended december  was a result of an increase in our invested short term and long term marketable securities balance during the course of the decrease in interest income for as compared to was the result in a decrease in our holdings of short term and long term marketable securities and a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   interest expense remained relatively flat at million as compared to the year ended december  the decrease during the year ended december  was due to lower interest expense as a result of our repurchases of a substantial portion of our convertible subordinated notes in december and at various times in  offset by interest payable on our convertible senior notes issued in december and january during  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes 
as a result of these transactions  we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations  including deferred financing amortization and capital lease interest expense  will not exceed million in other income expense  net 
net other income expense represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented  as well as gains on legal settlements 
other net income of million for the year ended december  represents approximately  of gains on legal settlements and  of foreign exchange gains 
for the year ended december   other net expense was  as compared to other net income of  for the year ended december  the difference between and is attributable to exchange rate fluctuations 
net other income expense may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates 
loss gain on investments  net 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss on investments of  on the sale of marketable securities 
during  we recorded a net gain of million  of which million related to the sale of equity investments in publicly traded companies  offset by losses of approximately  on investments in privately held companies and sale of marketable securities 
loss on investments in of approximately million included a loss of approximately million related to our investment in netaxs  inc  a related party  which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between netaxs and fastnet corporation in april in addition  loss on investments in included a loss of million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value 
the loss on investments was partially offset by a gain of  on the sale of our equity interest in akamai japan to sbbm and by approximately  of realized investment gains 
we do not expect significant gain or losses on investments  as we no longer hold investments in publicly or privately held companies 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
loss on early extinguishment of debt increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt is a result of costs incurred in connection with our repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes during this loss of million consists of the reduction of million of deferred financing costs associated with repurchases of notes prior to their maturity  million in premiums above par value paid to repurchase such notes  and million of advisory services and offering costs incurred in connection with the repurchases 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  provision for 
table of contents income taxes for the year ended december  was  the provision for income taxes during all periods presented relates to foreign income taxes which may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign income 
despite our profitability in  as of december   we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions private sales of capital stock and notes  an initial public offering of our common stock in october that provided million after underwriters discounts and commissions  the sale in june of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  which generated net proceeds of million  the sale in december and january of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which generated net proceeds of million  and cash generated by operations

cash provided by operating activities increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities decreased million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities for as compared to was primarily due to the increase in cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings during  as well as a decrease in payments made on accrued restructuring liabilities during the period 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities for as compared to was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in net losses before non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  loss on investments  equity related compensation and loss on early extinguishment of debt 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to remain positive as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenue billings and a reduction in payments towards our real estate restructuring liabilities  partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays due to expected increases in headcount 
however  the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities

cash received from the issuance of common stock under equity compensation plans increased in as compared to prior years as a result of more option exercises in changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenues  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sale of equity investments and settlements of notes receivable for stock

table of contents we believe  based on our present business plan  that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
we may seek to retire or refinance our long term debt with cash  equity or a combination thereof 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  over the next five years and thereafter in millions payments due by period contractual less than to to more than obligations total months months months months convertible subordinated notes convertible senior notes interest on convertible notes outstanding assuming no early redemption or repurchases real estate operating leases bandwidth and co location agreements capital leases and purchase obligations vendor equipment purchase obligations open vendor purchase orders total contractual obligations letters of credit as of december   we had issued million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of third party beneficiaries  primarily related to long term facility leases 
the letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities  of which million are classified as long term and  are classified as short term on our consolidated balance sheet dated as of december  the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire as provided by the letters of credit 
these restrictions are expected to lapse through may off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  stockholders of acquired companies  joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology 
generally  these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events  such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in the financial statements

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  we expect to adopt this standard in july under the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  a company records compensation expense for all new awards and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
r to our consolidated results of operations but expect that the adoption will have a material impact 
in september  the emerging issues task force  or the eitf  reached consensus on issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  or eitf eitf provides guidance on when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt securities with a market trigger should be included in diluted earnings per share  or eps 
the guidance states that these securities should be treated the same as other convertible securities and included in diluted eps computation  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf is effective for all periods ending after december  and is applied retrospectively 
as a result of the adoption of eitf  our convertible senior notes  convertible into million shares  are now included in our diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december   which has resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of for that period 
item a

in our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit 
we may incur realized losses as a result of early redemptions of our debt securities 
our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior notes are subject to changes in market value 
under certain conditions  the holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the notes on or after december  as of december   the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes were million and million  respectively 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the convertible senior notes were million and million  respectively 
we have operations in europe and asia 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
additionally  we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations  which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations
