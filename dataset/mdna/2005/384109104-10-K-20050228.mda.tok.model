critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual amounts will differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
sales returns 
an allowance is established for possible return of products 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
also  the company s written agreements with distributors typically limit the amount that may be returned 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
product warranty 
a liability is established for estimated warranty and service claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales 
the company estimates these costs based on historical claim experience and other factors  including evaluating specific customer warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
excess and discontinued inventory 
the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for excess and discontinued product are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for most claims related to products liability  workers compensation and employee medical benefits 
third party insurance is carried for what is believed to be the major portion of potential exposures that would exceed the company s self insured retentions 
the company has established liabilities for potential uninsured claims  including estimated costs and legal fees 
the company employs actuaries to assist in evaluating its potential ultimate exposure for uninsured claims and then considers factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  sales trends and other relevant factors in setting the liabilities 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims would result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal  state and international issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits 
retirement obligations 
the measurement of the company s pension and post retirement medical obligation is dependent on a number of assumptions including estimates of the present value of projected future payments  taking into consideration future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an impact on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include discount rates  inflation  salary increases  retirement rates  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
the company determines its discount rate assumption at year end based on the prevailing interest rate on long term corporate bonds rated aa as quoted by moody s investor services  an established credit rating agency 
the company bases its inflation assumption on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary assumptions are based on actual historical experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement rates are based on actual experience 
the investment return assumption is based on the expected long term performance of plan assets 
in setting this number  the company considers the input of actuaries and investment advisors  long term historical returns  the allocation of plan assets  and projected returns on plan assets 
mortality rates are based on a common group mortality table for males and females 
pension income in was million and was allocated to cost of products sold and operating expenses based on salaries and wages 
at december   a one half percent decrease in the indicated assumptions would have the following effects in thousands assumption funded status expense discount rate expected return on assets new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment that requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
this standard will be effective for the company starting with the third quarter of future compensation cost  net of tax effects  related to unvested stock compensation as of december  is approximately million in  million in and million in as valued and calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
the company has not yet determined how it will value future grants or whether it will elect to adjust prior periods upon adoption of sfas no 
revised 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the new standard is effective for the company starting in and is expected to have no significant impact on operating results or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of and fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the company expects the benefits from the provisions of the american jobs creation act of addressed by these fsp s to be similar to the extra territorial income exclusion rules in place for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
the company manages foreign currency market risk  from time to time  through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses forward exchange contracts  options and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from anticipated currency transactions and net monetary asset and liability positions 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound  and korean won 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of foreign currency translation changes  however  the direct effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
when compared to results  the weaker us dollar versus foreign currencies helped to increase sales and net earnings 
for the year ended december   the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
when appropriate  the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in earnings due to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
there was no such debt at december  long term outlook the company does not provide analysts or shareholders with specific targets for net sales or net earnings growth 
rather  management is committed to achieving its stated financial objectives over a long term time horizon 
the company s financial objectives are net sales growth exceeding percent annually net earnings growth exceeding percent annually return on sales exceeding percent return on assets exceeding percent return on equity exceeding percent outlook the company is expecting higher net sales and net earnings in this expectation is based on management s belief that most of the company s major markets will continue to experience favorable economic conditions in it is important to note that management s vision regarding future sales activity is limited due to the small backlog that the company carries 
in addition to economic growth  the improved sales outlook is dependent upon many factors  including the successful launch of new products  expanding distribution coverage  price increases  the successful management and integration of acquisitions and stable or favorable exchange rates versus the earnings outlook assumes higher sales  continued improvements in manufacturing which minimize cost increases including purchased commodities  the continued disciplined management of operating expenses  the successful management and integration of acquisitions and a relatively stable effective income tax rate
