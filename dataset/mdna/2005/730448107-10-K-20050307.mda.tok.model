item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
statements in the following discussion may be forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s financial results are most directly affected by changing prices for its production 
changing prices can influence not only current results of operations but the determination of the company s proved reserves and available sources of financing  including the determination of the borrowing base under its bank credit facility 
the company s results depend not only on hydrocarbon prices generally  but on its ability to market its production on favorable terms in the areas in which it is produced  including foreign areas such as thailand where the company s operations may be subject to local constraints on demand  currency restrictions  exchange rate fluctuations  the possibility of increases in taxes or other charges and non renewal or other adverse action relating to concessions or contracts  and other political risks 
on a longer term basis  the company s financial condition and results of operations are affected by its ability to replace reserves as they are produced through successful exploration  development and acquisition activities 
the company s results could also be adversely affected by adverse regulatory developments and operational risks associated with oil and gas operations 
some of the other risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s results are mentioned in the discussion that follows 
executive overview the company s objective is to cost effectively explore for  develop  acquire and produce oil and gas in select locations worldwide 
in pursuit of that objective  the company s goal for each year is to add more oil and gas reserves than it produces 
marked the thirteenth consecutive year of reserve replacement for the company 
the company pursues a balanced approach in core areas located in major oil and gas provinces in the united states and internationally 
the company follows a strict set of criteria when selecting areas of the world in which to explore 
areas selected are viewed as having proven oil and gas resources  having reasonable economic terms and possessing low political risk 
following these criteria  the company operates internationally in several selected areas gulf of thailand  hungary and offshore new zealand 
the company also seeks to maintain a balanced mixture of the gas oil ratio of its proven reserves base 
at the end of  proven reserves topped  bcfe and production for the year averaged more than  boe per day  mcfe per day 
oil and gas pricing and production volumes are important components of an exploration and development company s growth in net income and cash flow 
in  oil and gas pricing for the company was strong  with the average price increasing over on an equivalent barrel basis 
the company continues to have a strong balance sheet and to improve its financial leverage  although long term debt increased  primarily as a result of acquisitions  to million at december  from million at year end interest charges were reduced from million in to million in the company s debt to total capitalization ratio  an indicator of a company s financial strength  was 
cash and cash equivalents increased from million to million at year end company management believes being fiscally conservative is essential to position the company for future growth 
oil and gas capital and exploration expenditures for were approximately  million 
exploration development operations were allocated approximately million  and approximately million was spent on selective acquisitions in the company s core areas of operations 
during  approximately bcfe of proven reserves were added to the company s reserves ledger 
hurricane ivan update company operated gulf of mexico platforms did not sustain major damage as a result of hurricane ivan 
however  damages to outside owned and operated platforms and pipelines are continuing to cause a portion of the company s gulf of mexico production to remain shut in 
as of february  some  barrels of oil per day and million cubic feet of natural gas per day from main pass  south pass and viosca knoll areas remain shut in 
repairs to the infrastructure are underway  and the company expects to restore approximately of the production from these fields by the end of march  in order to protect its cash flow  the company has business interruption insurance for certain of the blocks affected by the shut in  the company expects to receive payment from its business interruption insurance policy until production is fully restored for a period of up to one year 
the daily indemnity amount expected to be paid to the company is approximately  per day for the main pass blocks and approximately  per day for other blocks affected by the shut in 
these amounts will be reduced by cash flow from partially restored production 
capital budget the company has established a million exploration and development budget excluding property acquisitions 
the company expects to spend approximately million on exploration and million on development activities 
the capital budget calls for the drilling of approximately wells during thailand and hungary disposition the company announced during the first quarter of that it would consider the sale or swap of the company s operations in thailand and hungary and has retained goldman  sachs co 
to advise it on the potential transactions 
international asset sale proceeds could be favorably treated by the tax provisions of the american jobs creation act of  if completed by year end exploration activities in thailand and development activities in both thailand and hungary will run concurrently with the company s consideration of the sale of its operations 
share repurchase during the first quarter of  the company announced a share repurchase plan 
the company expects to expend not less than million nor more than million dollars to effect the repurchases 
based on recent stock prices  the repurchase could represent approximately to of the shares outstanding at december  production outlook update the company currently expects that equivalent hydrocarbon production should reach within of the company s production levels  subject to changes in circumstances  acquisitions  divestitures and many other factors 
results of operations oil and gas revenues the company s oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for  which were an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for the following table reflects an analysis of variances in the company s oil and gas revenues expressed in thousands between years compared to compared to increase decrease in oil and gas revenues resulting from variances in natural gas price production crude oil and condensate price production natural gas liquids ngl increase in oil and gas revenues the increase in the company s oil and gas revenues in  compared to  is related to increases in both the average price that the company received for its hydrocarbon production volumes and an increase in the company s natural gas production volumes  partially offset by a decrease in crude oil and condensate production volumes 
the increase in the company s oil and gas revenues in  compared to  is related to increases in both the average price that the company received for its hydrocarbon production volumes and an increase in the company s natural gas and crude oil and condensate production volumes 
the increase in oil and gas revenues for  compared to and  was also the result of an increase in the average price that the company received for its ngl production volumes from and in and  respectively  to in other revenues other revenue is revenue derived from sources other than the current production of hydrocarbons 
this revenue includes  among other items  insurance proceeds excluding those related to operating expenses  which are credited against the appropriate expense category  pipeline imbalance settlements and revenue from salt water disposal activities 
the increase in the company s other revenues in  compared to either or  is related primarily to million of business interruption insurance recorded in with no comparable insurance claims in either or the business interruption insurance claim relates to the shut in of a significant portion of the company s gulf of mexico production during the fourth quarter of as a result of the infrastructure damage caused by hurricane ivan 
repairs to the infrastructure are underway  and the company expects to restore approximately of the production from the affected fields by the end of march  change to change to comparison of increases decreases in natural gas average prices north america a kingdom of thailand b company wide average price average daily production volumes mmcf per day north america kingdom of thailand company wide average daily production crude oil and condensate average prices c north america kingdom of thailand company wide average price average daily production volumes bbls per day north america kingdom of thailand d company wide average daily production total liquid hydrocarbons company wide average daily production bbls per day d a north american average prices reflect the impact of the company s price hedging activity

the company had no price hedging activity related to production 
price hedging activity reduced the average price of the company s north american crude oil and condensate production during and added to the average price during for north american average prices  sales volumes equate to actual production 
however  in the gulf of thailand  crude oil and condensate sold may be more or less than actual production 
see footnote d 
d oil and condensate production in the gulf of thailand is produced and stored on the fpso and fso pending sale and is sold in tanker loads that typically average between  and  barrels per sale 
therefore  oil and condensate sales volumes for a given period in the gulf of thailand may not equate to actual production 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  reported revenues are based on sales volumes 
however  the company believes that actual production volumes also provide a meaningful measure of the company s operating results 
the company produced  barrels less than it sold in   barrels more than it sold in and  barrels less than it sold in natural gas thailand prices 
the company has a long term gas sales agreement for its kingdom of thailand natural gas production 
this agreement covered approximately of the company s natural gas production 
the price that the company receives under its gas sales agreement with the petroleum authority of thailand ptt is based upon a formula that takes into account a number of factors including  among other items  changes in the baht dollar exchange rate and fuel oil prices in singapore 
the contract price is also subject to adjustments for quality 
ptt has further agreed to purchase supplemental gas volumes currently up to mmcf per day over and above the base contractual amount currently mmcf per day through december  these supplemental gas volumes over and above the base contractual amounts are sold to ptt at a price equal to of the then current price calculated under the gas sales agreement for the base contractual volumes

production 
the increase in the company s natural gas production during  compared to  was primarily related to acquisitions made during and late and  to a lesser extent  increased production from the continuing success of the company s exploration program at its los mogotes field in south texas 
these production gains were partially offset by shut in production resulting from the infrastructure damage caused by hurricane ivan in the final months of and natural production declines at other properties 
the increase in the company s natural gas production during  compared to  was primarily related to increased production from the continuing success of the company s exploration program at its los mogotes field in south texas  combined with the company s continued development of its gulf of thailand concession and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the production capacity of the lost cabin gas plant located on the company s madden field in wyoming 
these production gains were partially offset by natural production declines at other properties 
crude oil and condensate thailand prices 
prices that the company receives for its crude oil and condensate production from thailand are based on world benchmark prices  typically as a differential to malaysian tapis or dated brent crude  and are denominated in us dollars 
as discussed further under costs and expenses  lease operating expenses  the company records all crude oil held in the fpso and the fso at the end of an accounting period as inventory held at cost 
when such crude oil is sold  usually during the month following production  the cost of the crude oil and the sales revenue are recognized in the income statement 
as of december   the company had approximately  net barrels stored on board the fpso and fso 
production 
the decrease in the company s crude oil and condensate production during  compared to  resulted primarily from shut in production related to the infrastructure damage caused by hurricane ivan in the final quarter of  the temporary shutdown of the benchamas field in the gulf of thailand during january and february of to upgrade the benchamas central processing platform  natural production declines at the company s main pass blocks field in the gulf of mexico and processing problems at its gulf of thailand concession 
the increase in the company s crude oil and condensate production during  compared to  resulted primarily from the continued success of development programs at the company s main pass blocks field in the gulf of mexico and its gulf of thailand concession  partially offset by natural production declines at certain other properties 
ngl production 
the company s oil and gas revenues  and its total liquid hydrocarbon production  reflect the production and sale by the company of ngl  which are liquid products that are extracted from natural gas production 
the increase in ngl revenues for  compared with  related to an increase in the average price that the company received for its ngl production to in from in  in addition to a slight increase in ngl production volumes 
the increase in ngl revenues for  compared with  related to an increase in the average price that the company received for its ngl production to in from in  partially offset by a slight decline in ngl production volumes

the increase in north american lease operating expenses for  compared to  was due to higher production from the company s onshore properties and additional gulf of mexico platforms added during and the resulting increase in operating expenses as additional wells were subsequently brought on production and  to a lesser extent  increased expenses at the lost cabin gas plant in the madden unit  which was expanded in late the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  primarily related to costs associated with operating the five additional platforms which were added to the gulf of thailand during and the resulting increase in operating expenses as additional wells were brought on production during the company added five new platforms during and expects to add five new platforms in the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  primarily related to costs associated with operating the five additional platforms which were added to the gulf of thailand primarily during the second half of and the resulting increase in operating expenses as additional wells were subsequently brought on production 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the portion of lifting costs that is attributable to crude oil and condensate stored on the fpso and fso is treated as an inventoried cost until that crude oil and condensate is sold 
at the time the crude oil and condensate is sold  those inventoried lifting costs are recognized as lease operating expenses 
variances in production  sales and operating costs will result in variances in the amount of lease operating expense that is currently recognized as expense and the amount recorded as product inventory to be recognized in subsequent periods 
a substantial portion of the company s lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand relates to the lease payments made in connection with the bareboat charter of the fpso for the tantawan field and the fso for the benchamas field 
collectively  these lease payments accounted for approximately  net to the company s interest of the company s thailand lease operating expenses for and approximately  net to the company s interest of the company s thailand lease operating expenses for and the company currently expects these lease payments to remain relatively constant at approximately  net to the company s interest for the next two years 
see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements  other material long term commitments 
on a per unit of production basis  the company s total lease operating expenses were per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the increased unit costs in were primarily related to the increased expense associated with hurricane ivan remediation efforts and the decreased production volumes discussed above 
general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for  compared with  is primarily related to increases in compensation and related benefit expense and to increased professional fees due in part to compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for  compared with  primarily related to higher benefit expenses  increases in professional fees  costs related to the start of operations in the company s budapest office  increased insurance costs and expenses related to the company s decision  effective january   to expense stock based compensation 
on a per unit of production basis  the company s general and administrative expenses were per mcfe in  per mcfe in and per mcfe in exploration expenses exploration expenses consist primarily of rental payments required under oil and gas leases to hold non producing properties delay rentals and exploratory geological and geophysical costs that are expensed as incurred 
the increase in exploration expenses for  compared to  resulted primarily from increased d seismic acquisition activities in the gulf of mexico and seismic operations in the company s gulf coast division 
the increase in exploration expenses for  compared to  resulted primarily from increased d seismic acquisition activities in the gulf of mexico and seismic operations in the company s western region 
dry hole and impairment expenses dry hole and impairment expenses relate to costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled and impairment of oil and gas properties 
during the company drilled gross unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest  in the company drilled unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest and in the company drilled unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest 
the company had exploratory and development drilling success rates of in  in and in the company had approximately  of exploratory wells in progress or temporarily abandoned pending evaluation located primarily in the gulf of mexico at december  that had not been evaluated as of march  the company has also suspended approximately  in exploratory well costs related to wells completed more than one year prior to december  located primarily in the kingdom of thailand pending the determination of whether proved reserves can be ultimately assigned 
these costs will be charged to earnings in a future period if the company determines that proved reserves cannot be assigned 
generally accepted accounting principles require that if the expected future cash flow of the company s reserves on a property fall below the cost that is recorded on the company s books  these costs must be impaired and written down to the property s fair value 
depending on market conditions  including the prices for oil and natural gas  and the results of operations  a similar test may be conducted at any time to determine whether impairments are appropriate 
depending on the results of this test  an impairment could be required on some of the company s proved properties and this impairment could have a material negative non cash impact on the company s earnings and balance sheet 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
as a result of these reviews  the company recognized impairments to oil and gas properties of approximately  during approximately  of which was related to the company s international operations  approximately  during and  during depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses the company s provision for dd a expense is based on its capitalized costs and is determined on a cost center by cost center basis using the units of production method 
the company generally creates cost centers on a field by field basis for oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico and the gulf of thailand 
generally  the company establishes cost centers on the basis of an oil or gas trend or play for its onshore oil and gas activities 
the increase in the company s dd a expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from a decrease in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are lower than the company s recent historical composite dd a rate principally properties in the gulf of mexico which were shut in due to hurricane downtime  and the benchamas field in the gulf of thailand which was shut in for processing upgrades and a corresponding increase in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are higher than the company s recent historical composite rate principally increased production from domestic onshore properties acquired by acquisition 
the increase in the company s dd a expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in the company s natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production  partially offset by a decrease in the company s composite dd a rate 
the decrease in the composite dd a rate for all of the company s producing fields for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increased percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates lower than the company s recent historical composite rate principally certain gulf of mexico properties and the benchamas field and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates higher than the company s recent historical composite dd a rate 
production and other taxes the increase in production and other taxes for  compared to  is primarily related to increased severance taxes due to higher domestic onshore production volumes and prices 
the increase also relates to the recognition during of  of the special remunitory benefit srb obligation incurred on the company s kingdom of thailand concession 
during  the company incurred  of srb 
srb is a payment to the thai government required by the company s concession agreement after certain specified revenue  expenditure and drilling criteria have been achieved 
it is currently anticipated that the company will continue to pay srb for the foreseeable future 
the amount of srb to be incurred in is not currently determinable  as it will be computed using a complex formula that includes various factors such as revenues  expenditures and meters drilled on the thailand concession during the year but is expected to be significant 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and related production 
the increase in production and other taxes for  compared to  relates to the recognition during of  of srb obligations incurred on the company s kingdom of thailand concession 
no comparable srb expenses were incurred in the increase is also related to increased severance taxes due to higher domestic onshore production volumes and prices 
transportation and other transportation and other expense includes the company s cost to move its products to market transportation costs  accretion expense related to company asset retirement obligations under an accounting pronouncement adopted on january   natural gas purchase costs  tubular inventory valuation write offs and allowances  and various other operating expenses  none of which represents more than of this expense category 
the decrease in transportation and other expense for  compared to  relates primarily to a reduction in the company s transportation expenses  and the inclusion in of approximately million more of valuation allowances and reserves on items discussed above  than were expensed in the increase in transportation and other expense for  compared to  relates primarily to the inclusion of  of expense related to the accretion of the company s asset retirement obligation and a  write down of the cost of the company s tubular inventory stock  for which no comparable expenses were incurred in the company incurred transportation expense of  in   in and  in interest interest charges 
the decrease in the company s interest charges for  compared to  resulted primarily from a decrease in the average amount of the company s outstanding debt during the first eleven months of the year and the repayment of higher cost debt during the year  resulting in a lower weighted average cost of debt 
the company did incur million in additional debt during december primarily related to acquisitions  but this did not have a significant impact on the company s interest expense 
the decrease in the company s interest charges for  compared to  resulted primarily from a decrease of approximately million in the company s outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on the debt that remained outstanding 
capitalized interest 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are required to be capitalized until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if projects are evaluated as successful 
the decrease in capitalized interest for  compared to  resulted from a decrease in the weighted average rate on borrowings incurred by the company discussed above under results of operations interest charges and applied to such capital expenditures to arrive at the total amount of capitalized interest  partially offset by an increase in the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during approximately  compared to approximately 
the decrease in capitalized interest for  compared to  resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during approximately  compared to approximately 
this decrease was also impacted by changes in the weighted average rate on borrowings incurred by the company and applied to such capital expenditures to arrive at the total amount of capitalized interest 
loss on debt extinguishment the loss on debt extinguishment for is related to redemption premiums paid and or unamortized debt issuance costs which were expensed due to the redemption of the notes and the replacement of the company s previous bank credit facility with a new credit facility 
the loss on debt extinguishment for is related to redemption premiums paid and unamortized debt issuance costs which were expensed due to the redemption of the notes and notes 
no comparable costs were incurred in minority interest dividends and costs associated with mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust pogo trust i  a business trust in which the company owned all of the issued common securities  issued  of trust preferred securities on june  pogo trust i called the trust preferred securities for redemption on june  prior to their redemption  holders of  of the  outstanding trust preferred securities converted their trust preferred securities  representing over  face value of trust preferred securities  into  shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with the redemption  pogo trust i paid a total of  to former holders of the trust preferred securities 
subsequent to june   there were no trust preferred securities outstanding 
the amounts recorded under minority interest dividends and costs associated with preferred securities of a subsidiary trust principally reflect cumulative dividends and  to a lesser extent  the amortization of issuance expenses related to the offering and sale of the trust preferred securities 
income tax expense changes in the company s income tax expense are a function of the company s consolidated effective tax rate and its pre tax income and the jurisdiction in which the income is earned 
the increase in the company s tax expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from hungarian exploration losses for which no tax benefit could be recognized 
the increase in the company s tax expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from increased pre tax income derived from both the company s us and thailand operations in  partially offset by a decrease in the company s effective tax rate during the comparative periods 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate during  compared to  was primarily the result of the impairment of the company s hungarian operations for which no tax benefit was recognized due to the company s inability to offset the costs against expected future taxable income in hungary 
the lower effective tax rate during  compared to  was the result of higher pre tax income derived from the company s north american operations during the comparative periods  relative to its pre tax income from its thailand operations which are taxed at a rate higher than the us statutory rate 
the company announced in january that it would consider the disposition of its operations in thailand and hungary and therefore cannot currently predict whether foreign taxes will continue to constitute a substantial portion of its overall tax burden in future years

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas  as of january  sfas requires the company to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period in which it is incurred 
upon adoption of sfas  the company was required to recognize a liability for the present value of all legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and an asset retirement cost was capitalized as part of the carrying value of the associated asset 
upon initial application of sfas  the company recorded an after tax charge to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  this charge was required in order to recognize a liability for any existing aros adjusted for cumulative accretion  and also to increase the carrying amount of the associated long lived asset and its accumulated depreciation 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development  acquisition and production of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of income taxes 
the company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows 
the company adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition results  and cash flow 
the company has historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities  available cash  debt  and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs 
the company s cash flow provided by operating activities for was  this compares to cash flow from operating activities of  in and  in the resulting changes are attributable to the reasons described under results of operations above 
cash flow from operating activities in was sufficient to fund of the  in cash expenditures for capital and exploration projects and acquisitions for the year 
to fund the remaining expenditures  the company borrowed approximately  of cash net of repayments and the redemption discussed below 
the company paid  of dividends on its common stock during as of december   the company had cash and current investments of  including  in international subsidiaries which the company currently intends to reinvest in its foreign operations subject to its evaluation of the new tax provisions discussed in american jobs creation act of below and long term debt obligations of  with no principal repayment obligations until on april   the company paid  excluding accrued interest in cash to holders of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the redemption was made at of the face amount of the notes 
the cash redemption payment was funded through borrowings under the company s existing bank credit facility 
the company may elect to repurchase additional debt through market transactions  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  depending on market conditions  liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
on december  the company entered into a new credit agreement  replacing its then existing credit agreement dated as of march   as amended 
the new credit agreement is with various financial institutions and provides for revolving credit borrowings up to a maximum principal amount of million outstanding at any one time  with borrowings not to exceed a borrowing base determined at least semiannually 
the borrowing base is currently million 
the credit agreement provides that in specified circumstances involving an increase in ratings assigned to the company s debt  the company may elect for the borrowing base limitation to no longer apply to restrict available borrowings 
as of march   the company had an outstanding balance of  under its credit agreement see capital structure credit agreement 
american jobs creation act of on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of march   uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the act 
as a result  the company is not yet in a position to decide whether  and to what extent  it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us  therefore if technical corrections to the act are passed the company may repatriate in an amount up to approximately million of the cash and current investments held by international subsidiaries discussed in liquidity and capital resources above 
assuming of such cash is subject to tax at the us statutory rate  the repatriation would be subject to a tax liability of approximately million 
this amount excludes any proceeds that may be realized from the potential sale of the company s thailand and hungarian operations 
future capital and other expenditure requirements the company s capital and exploration budget for  which does not include any amounts that may be expended for acquisitions or any interest which may be capitalized resulting from projects in progress  was established by the company s board of directors at  the company has included gross wells in its capital and exploration budget  including wells to be drilled in the united states and the kingdom of thailand 
the company currently anticipates that its available cash and cash investments  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its credit agreement will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  its authorized capital budget  and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
the declaration and amount of future dividends on the company s common stock will depend upon  among other things  the company s future earnings and financial condition  liquidity and capital requirements  its ability to pay dividends and other payments under covenants contained in its debt instruments  the general economic and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by the company s board of directors 
stock repurchase on january   the company announced a plan to repurchase  through open market or privately negotiated transactions  not less than million nor more than million of its common stock 
as of march   the company had completed the purchase of  shares at a total cost of million 
other material long term commitments contractual obligations 
the company s material contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases  and other contracts 
material contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors 
see item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
a summary of the company s known contractual obligations as of december  are set forth on the following table payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c asset retirement obligations d total a includes interest on fixed rate debt but excludes variable rate interest expense on the company s bank credit facility 
b operating leases principally include the lease of the fpso and fso in thailand  the company s office lease commitments and various other equipment rentals  including gas compressors 
where rented equipment such as compressors is considered essential to the operation of the lease  the company has assumed that such equipment will be leased for the estimated productive life of the reserves  even if the contract terminates prior to such date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
c this represents i the company s share of the contractual commitments for two rigs drilling in the gulf of thailand 
no other drilling rigs working for the company are currently under contracts that have a term greater than six months or which cannot be terminated at the end of the well that is currently being drilled 
due to their short term nature and the indeterminate nature of the drilling time liabilities remaining on rigs drilling on a well by well basis  such obligations have not been included in this table  and ii firm transportation agreements representing ship or pay arrangements whereby the company has committed to ship certain volumes of gas for a fixed transportation fee principally from the madden field in wyoming 
the company entered into these arrangements to ensure its access to gas markets and currently expects to produce sufficient volumes to satisfy substantially all of its firm transportation obligations 
d this represents the company s estimate of future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including the rate of inflation  changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commitments under joint operating agreements 
the oil and gas industry operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating agreements  and the company s operations are no exception 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
the contractual obligations set forth above represent the company s working interest share of the contractual commitments that it has entered into as operator and  to the extent that it is aware  the contractual commitments entered into by the operator of projects that the company does not operate 
surety bonds 
in the ordinary course of the company s business and operations  it is required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies  primarily to cover self insurance  site restoration  equipment dismantlement  plugging and abandonment obligations 
as of december   the company had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain operations in the united states in the aggregate amount of approximately  that are not included in the prior table 
in connection with their administration of offshore leases in the gulf of mexico  the mms annually evaluates each lessee s plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the mms reviews this information and applies certain financial tests including  but not limited to  current asset and net worth tests 
the mms determines whether each lessee is financially capable of paying the estimated costs of such plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the company must annually provide the mms with financial information 
if the company does not satisfy the mms requirements  it could be required to post supplemental bonds 
in the past  the company has not been required to post supplemental bonds  however  there can be no assurance that the company will satisfy the financial tests and remain on the list of mms lessees exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements 
the company cannot predict or quantify the amount of any such supplemental bonds or the annual premiums related thereto and therefore has not included them in the prior table  but the amount could be substantial 
guarantees and letters of credit 
the company has also issued performance guarantees related to the operations of its subsidiaries in thailand 
if its subsidiaries do not fulfill their contractual obligations or legal obligations under the relevant local laws  the company could be obligated to make payments to satisfy the subsidiaries obligations 
most of these obligations relate to plugging  abandonment  site restoration and compliance with environmental laws 
the company also has guaranteed performance of its subsidiaries obligations under the fpso lease 
however  the company s guarantee of these obligations has not been so included 
currently  there are no material letters of credit that have been issued on the company s behalf 
credit agreement and borrowing base determination credit agreement 
the company has a revolving credit facility the credit agreement that provides for a  revolving loan facility terminating on december  the amount that may be borrowed under the credit agreement may not exceed a borrowing base determined at least semiannually using the administrative agent s usual and customary criteria for oil and gas reserve valuation  adjusted for incurrences of other indebtedness since the last redetermination of the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is currently million 
the credit agreement provides that in specified circumstances involving an increase in ratings assigned to pogo s debt  pogo may elect for the borrowing base limitation to no longer apply to restrict available borrowings 
the next redetermination of the borrowing base is expected to occur by may  a significant decline in the prices that the company is expected to receive for its future oil and gas production could have a material negative impact on the borrowing base under the credit agreement which  in turn  could have a material negative impact on the company s liquidity 
if at a redetermination of the borrowing base  the lenders reduce the borrowing base below the amount then outstanding under the credit agreement and other senior debt arrangements  the company must repay the excess to the lenders in no more than four substantially equal monthly installments  commencing not later than days after the company is notified of the new borrowing base 
the credit agreement includes procedures for additional financial institutions selected by the company to become lenders under the agreement  or for any existing lender to increase its commitment in an amount approved by the company and the lender  subject to a maximum of million for all such increases in commitments of new or existing lenders 
the credit agreement also permits short term swing line loans up to million and the issuance of letters of credit up to million  which in each case reduce the credit available for revolving credit borrowings 
as of march   there was  outstanding under the credit agreement 
application of critical accounting policies and management s estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  on a periodic basis and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but such costs are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
in most cases  a gain or loss is recognized for sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management s judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and application of industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
on occasion  wells are drilled which have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and in such instances an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within a productive oil and gas field are typically treated as development costs and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the proved reserve areas and therefore management must estimate the portion of seismic costs to expense as exploratory 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires management s judgment to estimate the fair value of exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company enters a new exploratory area in hopes of finding oil and gas reserves 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and the associated costs will be expensed as dry hole costs 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves are later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
the company had upward reserve revisions equivalent to  and of proved reserves during the years ended december   and  respectively 
these reserve revisions resulted primarily from improved performance from a variety of sources such as additional recoveries below previously established lowest known hydrocarbon levels  improved drainage from natural drive mechanisms  and the realization of improved drainage areas 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense would increase 
holding all other factors constant  a reduction in the company s proved reserve estimate of would result in an annual increase in dd a expense of approximately million 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows from its proved oil and gas properties and compares these future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to its fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
the company has recognized impairment expense in each of the periods covered by this form k 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that will require the company to record an impairment of its oil and gas properties and there can be no assurance that such impairments will not be required in the future nor that they will not be material 
fair values of derivative instruments the estimated fair values of the company s derivative instruments are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
historically  substantially all of the company s derivative instruments have represented cash flow hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
therefore  while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated at the end of each reporting period  the related changes in such fair values are not included in the company s consolidated results of operations  to the extent they are expected to offset the future cash flows from oil and natural gas production 
instead  the changes in fair value of hedging instruments are recorded directly to shareholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold 
the estimation of fair values for the company s hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the company estimates the fair values of its derivatives on a monthly basis using an option pricing model 
to utilize the option pricing model  the company uses various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using the company s current borrowing rates under its revolving credit facility 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
historically  the majority of the company s derivative instruments have been hedges of the price of crude oil and natural gas production 
the company is not involved in any derivative trading activities 
business combinations acquisitions in  the company grew through the acquisition of two corporations 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company s assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life are assessed for impairment at least annually 
the company has never recorded any goodwill in connection with its business combinations acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not do so in the future 
there are various assumptions made by the company in determining the fair values of an acquired company s assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired 
to determine the fair values of these properties  the company prepares estimates of oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
these estimates are based on work performed by the company s engineers and outside petroleum reservoir consultants 
the judgments associated with the estimation of reserves are described earlier in this section 
the fair value of the estimated reserves acquired in a business combination is then calculated based on the company s estimates of future oil  natural gas and ngl prices 
the company s estimates of future prices are based on its own analysis of pricing trends 
these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics  such as economic growth forecasts 
they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability  drilling rig activity  changes in delivery capacity and trends in regional pricing differentials 
future price forecasts from independent third parties are also taken into account in arriving at the company s own pricing estimates 
the company s estimates of future prices are applied to the estimated reserve quantities acquired to arrive at estimated future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues are then discounted to derive a fair value for such reserves 
the company also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved reserves acquired in a business combination 
these unproved reserves are generally classified as either probable or possible reserves 
because of their very nature  probable and possible reserve estimates are less precise than those of proved reserves 
generally  in the company s business combinations  the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires more judgment than the estimates of fair values for other acquired assets and liabilities 
future development and abandonment costs future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  fpsos  fsos  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the ultimate settlement amount  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the political  legal  environmental and regulatory environment 
the company reviews its assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on an annual basis 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of sfas sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
holding all other factors constant  if the company s estimate of future abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates were revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
it would require an increase in the present value of the company s estimated future abandonment cost of approximately million representing an increase of approximately to the company s december  asset retirement obligation to increase the company s dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  pension and other post retirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions including the expected rates of return on plan assets  determination of discount rates for remeasuring plan obligations  determination of inflation rates regarding compensation levels and health care cost projections 
the company develops its demographics and utilizes the work of actuaries to assist with the measurement of employee related obligations 
the assumptions used vary from year to year  which will affect future results of operations 
any differences among these assumptions and the results actually experienced will also impact future results of operations 
an analysis of the effect of a change in health care cost trends on post retirement benefits is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company generally provides taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
where the company s present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in its foreign operations  the company does not provide for us income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance the foreign operations of the company 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  commodity pricing and expenditures by tax jurisdiction for the company s operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 
see liquidity and capital resources american jobs creation act of management also periodically assesses  by tax jurisdiction  the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings outlooks 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the assessments are subject to revision in the future 
other matters inflation 
publicly held companies are asked to comment on the effects of inflation on their business 
currently annual inflation in terms of the decrease in the general purchasing power of the dollar is running well below the general annual inflation rates experienced in the past 
while the company  like other companies  continues to be affected by fluctuations in the purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation  such effect is not currently considered significant 
southeast asia economic issues 
a substantial portion of the company s oil and gas operations are conducted in southeast asia  and a substantial portion of its natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production is sold there 
as with most emerging market economies  the thai economy is particularly sensitive to worldwide economic trends and to the effect of the recent tsunami disaster in the kingdom 
the economic health of the thai economy and its effect on the volatility of the thai baht against the dollar will continue to have a material impact on the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand  together with the prices that the company receives for its oil and natural gas production there 
see results of operations  oil and gas revenues 
all of the company s current natural gas production from the thailand concession is committed under a long term gas sales agreement in each case to ptt at prices denominated in thai baht which are determined in accordance with a formula that is intended to ameliorate  at least in part  any decline in the purchasing power of the thai baht against the dollar 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and business miscellaneous  sales 
although the company currently believes that ptt will honor its commitments under the gas sales agreement  a failure by ptt to honor such commitments could have a material adverse effect on the company 
during  the government of thailand partially privatized the petroleum authority of thailand  forming ptt and retaining an ownership interest of approximately 
ptt is a publicly traded entity that currently constitutes one of the largest public companies in the kingdom of thailand 
however  its contractual obligations are no longer backed by the full faith and credit of the thai government 
the company s crude oil and condensate production from the thailand concession is currently sold on a tanker load by tanker load basis 
prices that the company receives for such production are based on world benchmark prices  which are denominated in dollars  and are typically paid in dollars

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued three new pronouncements relevant to the company s accounting 
these are statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
and fasb staff position fas fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 
sfas r 
sfas r will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r is effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company currently follows the provisions of sfas and the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
sfas sfas was a result of an effort by the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
one such difference was the exception from fair value measurement in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets 
sfas replaces this exception with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas will be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance of this statement 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
fsp fas in december  the fasb staff issued fsp fas to provide accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provisions included in the act 
the act introduced a special limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer 
as a result  an issue has arisen as to whether an enterprise should be allowed additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the act was enacted to evaluate the effects of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying statement the following are the key points relevant to the company s position an enterprise is allowed additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act without undermining the entity s assertion that repatriation of foreign earnings is not expected within the foreseeable future 
an enterprise should recognize the income tax effect when it decides on a plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
this decision may occur in stages  and each stage may occur at a different time 
also  before its plan for reinvestment or repatriation is finalized  an enterprise may decide on a range of amounts that it will repatriate 
in this situation  the fsp requires recognition of the income tax effect of the lowest amount within the range 
if an enterprise has recognized a deferred tax liability for some  or all  of its unremitted foreign earnings because it did not overcome the presumption of repatriation of foreign earnings  it should continue to presume repatriation of those earnings as well as current foreign earnings that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
the enterprise shall measure the income tax effects of such repatriation without the effects of the repatriation provision until it has decided on a plan for repatriation 
an enterprise that has not yet completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision should make certain disclosures 
additional disclosures are required in the period an enterprise completes its evaluation the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of fsp fas and is currently evaluating the effects of the act 
the company expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment shortly after passage of technical corrections to the act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
in the past  the company has made limited use of a variety of derivative financial instruments only for non trading purposes as a hedging strategy to manage commodity prices associated with oil and gas sales and to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
see business competition and market conditions 
interest rate risk from time to time  the company has entered into various financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
as of march   the company has no open interest rate swap or interest rate lock agreements 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  thereafter total fair value long term debt variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk in addition to the us dollar  the company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct their business in thai baht and hungarian forint and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its oil and gas production and sales in southeast asia 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  have experienced severe economic difficulties in the past  including sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  other matters  southeast asia economic issues 
the economic situation in thailand and the volatility of the thai baht against the dollar could have a material impact on the company s thailand operations and prices that the company receives for its natural gas production there 
although the company s sales to ptt under the gas sales agreement are denominated in baht  because predominantly all of the company s crude oil sales and its capital and most other expenditures in the kingdom of thailand are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand 
as of march   the company is not a party to any foreign currency exchange agreement 
exposure from market rate fluctuations related to activities in hungary  where the company s functional currency is the us dollar  is not material at this time 
current hedging activity as of december   the company held various derivative instruments 
during  the company entered into natural gas and crude oil option agreements referred to as collars 
collars are designed to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
the company has designated these contracts as cash flow hedges designed to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to price volatility 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of derivatives also involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
currently  the company does not expect losses due to creditworthiness of its counterparties 
the gas hedging transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
the oil hedging transactions are generally settled based on the average of the reporting settlement prices for west texas intermediate on the nymex for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
for any particular collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to the company if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction  and the company is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price of such transaction 
the estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  volatility and the time value of options
