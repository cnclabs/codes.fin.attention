all references to fiscal years are references to our fiscal years ending april overview cutter buck designs  sources  markets  and distributes high quality men s and women s sportswear under the cutter buck brand 
we sell our products primarily through corporate accounts  golf pro shops and resorts  upscale specialty and department retail stores  and international distributors and licensees 
we focus on the needs of our customers and end consumers and design products to meet those needs 
management is currently focusing on strengthening the upscale positioning of the cutter buck brand  and refining the execution of all of our business processes to enable the highest level of customer satisfaction and increase penetration into our target markets 
the goal of this strategy is to increase net sales while maintaining strong gross profit 
a portion of the decrease in sales over the past few years can be attributed to our goal of foregoing less profitable business and improving gross margins 
now  our long term objective is to grow the business while maintaining strong gross margins 
however  due in part to the long product lead times in this industry  we remain relatively cautious about sales in the upcoming year 
in order to implement this strategy  during fiscal  we have enhanced our design team and increased our marketing efforts to improve our brand awareness and acceptance 
we have conducted market studies and focus groups to help us understand and meet the desires of consumers 
management is committed to continuing its increased spending on marketing and branding programs in fiscal we are also investing in the development of management information systems to improve our processes and continue our commitment to customer service 
we expect the new systems to provide significantly improved management information and support for our future operations 
we expect these costs to ultimately be offset by increases in sales and improvements in operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  we restructured our business to focus our efforts on our ongoing wholesale business and reduce our operating costs 
to better understand the performance of our ongoing wholesale business over the past three years  management considers it useful to review our operating results excluding costs that are not elements of running our business on an ongoing basis  such as restructuring and restatement expenses and costs related to our former retail store and european operations 
we also exclude the effects of income taxes in this analysis  because we do not believe the historical effective rates for financial reporting are indicative of our ongoing effective rates due to fluctuations in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
we adjust our net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to exclude these items in order to give us better information regarding the profitability of our ongoing wholesale business on a quarterly and year to date basis 
year ended april  in thousands net income loss as reported income loss from discontinued retail operations income tax expense benefit pre tax income expense of closed european operations restructuring and asset impairment expenses restatement expenses ongoing wholesale business income before tax this analysis illustrates the strong performance of the company s core wholesale business since the restructuring and excluding the significant expenses in and related to the restatement

from to  the ongoing wholesale business income before tax was generally flat  despite a slight decrease in net sales and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due to strategic initiatives and sarbanes oxley compliance 
this was primarily due to continued improvement in gross margins

golf sales have also been impacted as we hired and trained sales representatives who were new to the cutter buck brand 
our golf business unit remains our greatest challenge and a high priority 
we continue to strengthen our product offering  marketing efforts  and customer focus 
during the year  we spent a great deal of time with consumers analyzing perceptions of the brand to more clearly understand the needs and expectations of this channel 
in addition  we are working with our customers as we develop a more compelling product offering  supported by a more aggressive marketing strategy 
these efforts are designed to raise the level of awareness of the features and benefits of our products to the ultimate consumer

our corporate sales are generally at higher margins than sales in our other business units 
we have also shifted more of our international sales to licensees  as opposed to distributors  whereby we incur fewer direct costs

we have consistently included inbound freight charges in cost of sales  and included other costs of distribution in selling  general and administrative expenses

these expenses cannot be estimated at this time 
income taxes we recorded approximately million of income tax expense for fiscal compared to million of income tax expense for fiscal the effective rate for income taxes in fiscal was well below our fiscal effective tax rate and below our anticipated ongoing effective tax rate

in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
based on the level of our historical taxable income and forecasts for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences were anticipated to reverse  management believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would be unable to realize the full benefit of our deferred tax assets 
considering the fiscal results and forecasts for future taxable income  management determined that it is now more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these assets 
therefore  in fiscal we reversed the allowance of million 
in addition  income tax expense for the year was reduced by million related to the reconciliation of the tax provision to the income tax return as filed for fiscal and changes in estimates of our income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing capital requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth and operations of our business  including investments in fixed assets 
during fiscal  our capital requirements were funded by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to significant reductions in inventory levels in fiscal as a result of an effort to manage inventory down to levels more in line with our current sales levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to fewer net purchases of short term investments in fiscal the company continues to increase the amount of cash invested in short term interest bearing us government and high quality corporate debt instruments 
we hold these instruments to maturity  which currently averages days at the date of purchase 
at april  we held million in short term investments 
to support our operations  capital expenditures totaling million were incurred during fiscal these capital expenditures primarily consist of information technology initiatives  as we upgrade and replace some of our computer systems 
a similar level of capital expenditures is currently anticipated for fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million  which primarily consisted of dividends and repurchases of the company s common stock  offset by the proceeds from stock issued pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
during fiscal  we paid dividends totaling per share of common stock 
on july   the board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share as well as a special dividend of per share 
we may decide to discontinue or modify our quarterly dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital may be in the best interests of our shareholders 
our share repurchase program  initiated in march authorized the purchase of up to million in company stock 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of 
subsequent to year end through july   the company has repurchased an additional  shares at a total cost of  bringing the total number of shares repurchased under this program since its inception to  at a total cost of  on july   the board of directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase program to provide for up to million of additional repurchases beyond the million repurchased through july   bringing the total repurchase authorization since inception of the program to million 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the stock repurchase program may be suspended at any time without notice 
the timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on market conditions  alternative uses of capital  and other factors 
on march   the company entered into a new three year loan agreement with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na  secured by all assets of the company  for a million line of credit 
borrowings under this agreement will bear interest at prime minus 
covenants contained in this loan agreement include maintaining a debt to equity ratio of not more than  a quick ratio of not less than  and profitability of million per year 
additionally  capital expenditures are limited to million per year 
as of april   the company had no borrowings under this line of credit other than open letters of credit with suppliers totaling million 
the special dividend and the additional share repurchases that were approved on july   represent approximately million of capital the company plans to return to shareholders 
we believe that the remaining cash on hand and cash generated from operations  as well as our ability to borrow under bank lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements during fiscal also  we have the ability to suspend the stock repurchase program at any time  as well as alternative sources of financing available  including factoring our accounts receivable and financing our capital expenditures with leases 
although these methods of financing are currently available  we do not anticipate using alternative sources of financing during fiscal however  our capital needs will depend on many factors  including our growth rate  the need to finance increased production and inventory levels  the success of our various sales and marketing programs  expenses associated with the risks and uncertainties related to our restatement  and various other factors 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of april  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands purchase obligations letters of credit operating leases restructuring liabilities capital leases retention bonuses the letters of credit  operating lease commitments  and purchase obligations are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
foreign currency exchange risk in conjunction with the closing of our european operations  we have some remaining assets and liabilities denominated in euros 
these balances are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
to the extent we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s filing on form k for the year ended april  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for sales allowances we maintain a reserve for future sales allowances related to current period sales 
we analyze the rate of historical sales allowances and changes in sales programs when evaluating the adequacy of this reserve 
the estimate for sales allowances is included in our calculation of net sales 
if we were to grant additional sales allowances  additional reserves may be required 
reserve for product returns we maintain a reserve for probable future product returns related to current period product receivables 
we analyze the rate of historical returns and trends in changes to the rate  if any  when evaluating the adequacy of this reserve 
the estimate for product returns is included in our calculation of net sales 
if we were to experience an increase in our product returns  additional reserves may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for accounts that are doubtful to be ultimately collected  resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these losses are included in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition and credit history  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories  which are predominantly finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the weighted average method 
we perform a detailed analysis of inventory on a quarterly basis to identify unsold out of season merchandise 
we estimate the net realizable value of the out of season merchandise based upon disposition plans and historical experience 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying amount of out of season merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
restructuring liabilities restructuring related liabilities consist of estimates for losses on anticipated disposition of lease obligations 
key variables in determining this estimate include the anticipated timing of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts  and estimates for brokerage and other related costs 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust our estimates based on currently available information 
valuation allowance in deferred income tax assets we periodically review the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset balances to their net realizable value 
to the extent we determine an allowance is required  we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our historical taxable income and forecasts of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse 
if our actual results are lower than our forecasted future results  additional allowances may be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rate risks associated with financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest in interest bearing us government and high quality corporate debt instruments and hold these instruments until maturity 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair market value of these instruments 
investments with maturities beyond ninety days as of the purchase date are classified as short term investments 
the average time to maturity as of the purchase date for short term investments held as of april   was days 
due to the short term nature of these instruments and our investment policies and procedures  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk  to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or for speculative trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our marketable fixed income securities classified as short term investments  including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at april  us corporate debt securities expected maturity date by august  average interest rate
