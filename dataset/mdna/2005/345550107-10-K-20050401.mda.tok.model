item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate description we principally engage in the ownership  development  management and acquisition of commercial and residential real estate throughout the united states 
we operate through three strategic business units 
the commercial group  our largest business unit  owns  develops  acquires and operates regional malls  specialty urban retail centers  office buildings  hotels and mixed use projects 
new york city operations through our partnership with forest city ratner companies are part of the commercial group 
the residential group owns  develops  acquires and operates residential rental property  including upscale and middle market apartments  adaptive re use developments and supported living facilities 
real estate groups are the combined commercial and residential groups 
the land development group acquires and sells both land and developed lots to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
it also owns and develops land into master planned communities and mixed use projects 
the lumber group formerly presented as lumber trading group was sold on november  to its employees and is no longer a strategic business unit or reportable segment of the company 
the assets and liabilities of lumber group were classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at january  the operating results of lumber group have been included in discontinued operations for the years ended january   and in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the nets  a franchise of the nba in which we are an equity investor  is a reportable segment of the company 
we have approximately billion of assets in states and the district of columbia at january  our core markets include new york city philadelphia metropolitan area  denver  boston  greater washington dc baltimore metropolitan area and california 
our corporate headquarters are in cleveland  ohio 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include our accounts  all majority owned subsidiaries where we have financial or operational control  and variable interest entities vies where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are subject to judgment and uncertainties 
we have used our best judgment to determine estimates of certain amounts included in the financial statements as a result of these policies  giving due consideration to materiality 
as a result of uncertainties surrounding these events at the time the estimates are made  actual results could differ from these estimates causing adjustments to be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe contain uncertainties that are considered critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
our management reviews and discusses the policies below on a regular basis 
these policies have also been discussed with our audit committee of the board of directors 
recognition of revenue real estate sales we recognize gains on sales of real estate pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the deposit  finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for reporting dispositions of operating properties 
pursuant to the definition of a component of an entity in sfas no 
 assuming no significant continuing involvement  all earnings of properties which have been sold or held for sale are reported as discontinued operations 
we consider assets held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the transaction from closing 
in most transactions  these contingencies are not satisfied until the actual closing and  accordingly  the property is not identified as held for sale until the closing actually occurs 
however  each potential sale is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances 
leasing operations we enter into leases with tenants in our rental properties 
the lease terms of tenants occupying space in the residential  retail centers and office buildings range from one to years  excluding leases with anchor tenants which typically run longer 
minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
overage rents are recognized as revenues when tenants sales exceed contractual amounts 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other commercial property operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
construction revenue and profit on long term fixed price contracts are recorded using the percentage of completion method 
on reimbursable cost plus fee contracts  revenues are recorded in the amount of the accrued reimbursable costs plus proportionate fees at the time the costs are incurred 
we currently have one long term fixed price arrangement in our commercial group to complete an approximate  square foot office building in brooklyn  new york 
recognition of costs and expenses operating expenses primarily represent the recognition of operating costs  which are charged to operations as incurred  administrative expenses and taxes other than income taxes 
interest expense and real estate taxes during development and construction are capitalized as a part of the project cost 

table of contents we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of accounts or notes receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible 
such allowances are reviewed and updated quarterly for changes in expected collectibility 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the estimated useful lives of buildings and first generation tenant allowances are primarily years 
subsequent tenant improvements are amortized over the estimated useful life  which typically approximates the estimated useful life of the tenant lease 
major improvements and tenant improvements are capitalized and expensed through depreciation charges 
repairs  maintenance and minor improvements are expensed as incurred 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
costs and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reported in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we review our properties to determine if their carrying costs will be recovered from future operating cash flows whenever events or changes indicate that recoverability of long lived assets may not be assured 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying costs  an impairment loss is recorded as a provision for decline in real estate 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves on notes receivable we record allowances against our rent receivables from commercial and residential tenants that we deem to be uncollectible 
these allowances are based on management s estimate of receivables that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
this estimate is calculated based on a four year history of early tenant lease terminations as well as an estimate for expected activity of current tenants in the case of the straight line rent adjustments 
there is a risk that our estimate of the expected activity of current tenants may not accurately reflect future events 
if the estimate does not accurately reflect future tenant vacancies  the reserve for straight line rent receivable may be over or understated by the actual tenant vacancies that occur 
we estimate the allowance for notes receivable based on our assessment of the collectibility of the note 
our assessment of collectibility is based largely on expected future cash flows estimated to be paid to our limited partners 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows does not accurately reflect actual events  our reserve on notes receivable may be over or understated by the actual cash flows that occur 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at january  and was  and  respectively 
for the years ended january  and  we reduced reserves by and  respectively  related to notes receivable at certain residential properties 
these reserves were reduced due to the occurrence of a series of events 
in the course of evaluating these events and their effect on the collectibility of the notes  we used estimates 
these estimates included  but were not limited to  estimated appraisal values as well as future cash flows at these properties 
these estimates can be affected by market conditions at the time that will not only affect the appraisal value but operating cash flow projections 
had different estimates been applied  the amount of the reserves reversed might have been different than the amounts actually recorded 
due to the company s implementation of fasb interpretation number fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities  the balances of these notes and the respective reserves were eliminated 
economic lives depreciation and amortization is generally computed on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the estimated useful lives of buildings and first generation tenant allowances are primarily years 
subsequent tenant improvements are amortized over the life of the tenant s lease 
this estimate is based on the length of time the asset is expected to generate positive operating cash flows 
actual events and circumstances can cause the life of the building to be different than the estimates made 
additionally  lease terminations can affect the economic life of the tenant improvements 
we believe the estimated useful lives and classification of the amortization of fixed assets and tenant improvements are reasonable and follow industry standards 
asset impairment we review our investment portfolio to determine if its carrying costs will be recovered from future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes indicate that recoverability of long lived assets may not be assured 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs  an impairment loss is recorded as a provision for decline in real estate for assets in our real estate portfolio pursuant to the guidance established in sfas no 
as part of the analysis to determine if an impairment loss has occurred  we are required to make estimates to determine future operating cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future operating cash flows  such as occupancy rates and rent and expense increases  we may not record an impairment loss  or may record a greater impairment loss on a property 
allowance for projects under development we record an allowance for development project write offs for our projects under development included in real estate  at cost on its consolidated balance sheets 
a specific project is written off against this allowance when it is determined by management that the project will not be developed 
the allowance is adjusted on a quarterly basis based on our actual development project write off history 
the allowance increased by  and 
table of contents  for the years ended january   and  respectively  which were reported in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
variable interest entities effective february   we adopted fin no 
r 
under fin no 
r  we are required to consolidate a vie if our interest in the vie is such that we will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
calculating expected losses and or expected residual returns involves estimating expected future cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future cash flows  such as the probability of the future cash flows and the risk free rate  we may have otherwise concluded on the consolidation method of an entity 
fiscal year the years  and refer to the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
results of operations we report our results of operations by each of our three strategic business units as we believe this provides the most meaningful understanding of our financial performance 
in addition to our three strategic business units  we have two additional segments the nets and corporate activities 
overview we are a fully integrated real estate company principally engaged in the ownership  development  acquisition and management of commercial and residential real estate throughout the united states 
our portfolio includes interests in retail centers  apartment communities  office buildings  land for development and hotels 
we believe that our company benefits from our geographic focus and product diversity 
our products are focused in our core markets  which include new york city philadelphia metropolitan area  denver  boston  greater washington  dc baltimore metropolitan area and california 
these are growing urban markets with high barriers to entry where we have successfully gained access to large  complex commercial  residential and mixed use projects 
as a result of an ongoing effort to increase property concentration in the core markets  these markets now account for percent of the cost of our portfolio at january  we expect this concentration to increase as percent of the cost of the total projects opened or acquired during  and percent of the cost of the projects under construction as of the end of  are in these markets 
during  we completed the sale of the company s lumber group strategic business unit to its employees  and purchased an interest in the nets  a franchise of the nba 
the purchase of the interest in the nets is the first step in our efforts to pursue additional real estate related development projects in brooklyn  new york 
additionally  we completed ten project openings and acquisitions including victoria gardens  an open air lifestyle center in rancho cucamonga  california  atlantic terminal  an office and retail project in brooklyn  new york  and a life sciences research facility at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia  which represents our first biotechnology related project outside of the boston market 
other significant milestones occurring during included closing billion in mortgage financing transactions on a fully consolidated basis at attractive interest rates  taking advantage of market conditions and relatively high valuations by disposing of properties  redeploying our capital toward projects in our core markets  the signing of a year partnership agreement for the ownership  development and management of us navy family housing at five existing navy communities in hawaii  our designation as developer of the first phase of an acre mixed use community adjacent to the johns hopkins university medical campus in east baltimore  maryland  closing of two major land acquisitions  a  acre master planned community in austin  texas and a  acre parcel in manatee county florida 
in  we completed three corporate financing transactions that took advantage of the favorable capital markets experienced during the year 
these transactions were executed with attractive long term rates to significantly improve our liquidity and long term financial flexibility 
in the first quarter of we completed an offering of  senior notes due and renegotiated our corporate credit facility 
the expansion of our credit facility to  represents a  increase in availability in our credit line 
in january  we completed an offering of  senior notes due in march  our bank group committed to amend our long term credit facility 
the amendment extends the maturity by one year to march  lowers our borrowing rate to over libor or over the prime rate  eliminates the higher rate tier on the last  of borrowings  and contains an accordion provision which allows us to increase the availability under the revolving line of credit by  in the next months 
the amendment also increases the combined availability of letters of credit or surety bonds by  to  and adds a swing line availability of  for up to three business days 
at the end of the year  projects were under construction of which are scheduled to open in with more than projects under development  we have a dynamic pipeline that should provide opportunity and enhance shareholder value for years to come 
we were selected by pfizer to acquire and redevelop its current site  which we purchased for  contains approximately  square feet of existing space on acres with potential to expand 
we have a track record of past successes and a strong pipeline of future opportunities 
with a balanced portfolio concentrated in the product types and geographic markets that offer many unique  financially rewarding opportunities  we appear to be well positioned for future growth 

table of contents net earnings net earnings for the company for the year ended january  were  versus  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively

table of contents subordinated debt in may  we purchased  of subordinate tax revenue bonds that were contemporaneously transferred to a custodian  which in turn issued custodial receipts that represent ownership in the bonds to unrelated third parties 
we evaluated the transfer pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities and have determined that the transfer does not qualify for sale accounting treatment principally because we have guaranteed the payment of principal and interest in the unlikely event that there is insufficient tax revenue to support the bonds when the custodial receipts are subject to mandatory tender on december  as such  the book value which approximates amortized costs of the bonds was recorded as a secured borrowing with liability reported as senior and subordinated debt and held to maturity securities reported as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
we do not participate in and therefore do not report any net cash flows related to this borrowing 
in november  we issued  of redevelopment bonds in a private placement

the bonds were immediately sold to lehman brothers  inc lehman and were subsequently acquired by a qualified special purpose entity the trust  which in turn issued trust certificates to third parties 
the district had a call option on the revenue bonds which began in august and had a call option on the tif bonds beginning in august see below 
in the event the bonds were not removed from the trust  we had the obligation to repurchase the bonds from the trust 
upon removal of the bonds from the trust  stapleton land was entitled to the difference between the interest paid on the bonds and the cumulative interest paid to the certificate holders less trustee fees  remarketing fees  and credit enhancement fees the retained interest 
we assessed our transfer of the bonds to lehman at inception and determined that it qualified for sale accounting treatment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
because we did not maintain control over the trust  and the bonds were legally isolated from our creditors 
at inception  the retained interest had no determinable fair value as the cash flows were not practical to estimate because of the uncertain nature of the tax base still under development 
in accordance with sfas no 
 no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the bonds to lehman 
as a result  the retained interest was recorded at zero with all future income to be recorded under the cost recovery method 
we separately assessed the obligation to redeem the bonds from the trust pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and concluded the liability was not material 
the original principal outstanding under the securitization structure described above was  which was not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
we reassessed the fair value and adjusted the amount of the retained interest through other comprehensive income oci on a quarterly basis 
we measured our retained interest in the trust at its estimated fair value based on the present value of the expected future cash flows  which were determined based on the expected future cash flows from the underlying bonds and from expected changes in the rates paid to the certificate holders discounted at market yield  which considered the related risk 
the difference between the amortized cost of the retained interest approximately zero and the fair value was recorded  net of the related tax and minority interest  in shareholders equity as a change in accumulated oci 
the quarterly fair value calculations were determined based on the application of the following key assumptions determined at the time of transfer estimated weighted average life in years  which was approximately two years  and residual cash flows discount rate  which was 
we recorded the fair value  net of tax and minority interest  of the retained interest in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the retained interest at january  and was and   net of tax and minority interest  respectively 

table of contents in august  the  tif bonds were defeased and removed from the trust with the proceeds of a new  bond issue by the denver urban renewal authority dura  and the  revenue bonds  which bear interest at a rate of  were removed from the trust through a third party purchase 
upon removal of the  revenue bonds from the trust  the third party deposited the bonds into a special purpose entity the entity 
as the tif and revenue bonds were successfully removed from the trust  stapleton land recognized   net of tax and minority interest of interest income for the year ended january  in the consolidated statements of earnings upon receipt of the retained interest 
of this amount  the fair value of   net of tax and minority interest was recognized in oci in previous fiscal years and deferred until august under the cost recovery method of revenue recognition 
the remaining amount of   net of tax and minority interest was earned and recognized during the year ended january  stapleton land does not expect to receive or pay any additional amounts related to the retained interest 
also in august  the entity issued two types of securities  puttable floating option tax exempt receipts p floats which bear interest at a short term floating rate as determined by the remarketing agent and residual interest tax exempt securities receipts rites  which receive the residual interest from the revenue bonds after the p float interest and various program fees have been paid 
the p floats were sold to third parties 
a consolidated affiliate of ours acquired the rites for a nominal amount and provided credit enhancement to the trustor of the entity including an initial collateral contribution of  during the year ended january   we contributed additional net collateral of  we have consolidated the secured borrowing because of our obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses 
the book value which approximates amortized cost of the p floats  which mature in july  was reported as nonrecourse mortgage debt  the revenue bonds were reported as other assets and the collateral was reported as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet at january  as of january   the consolidated affiliate was exposed to losses to the extent there is a decrease in the value of the revenue bonds 
for the year ended january   we recorded approximately   net of tax and minority interest of interest income related to this secured borrowing in the consolidated statement of earnings 
of this amount approximately  is interest income on the rites and  is interest income on the collateral 
other financing arrangements in may  a third party purchased  in tax increment revenue bonds issued by dura  with a fixed rate coupon of and maturity date of october   which were used to fund the infrastructure costs associated with phase ii of the stapleton development project 
the dura bonds were transferred to a trust that issued floating rate trust certificates 
stapleton land entered into an agreement with the third party to purchase the dura bonds from the trust if they are not repurchased or remarketed between june  and june  stapleton land will receive a fee upon removal of the dura bonds from the trust equal to the coupon rate  less the bond market association index fixed at through june   plus basis points  less all fees and expenses due to the third party collectively  the fee 
we have concluded that the trust described above is considered a qualified special purpose entity qspe pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and thus is excluded from the scope of fin no 
r 
as a result  the dura bonds and the activity of the trust have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the purchase obligation and the fee have been accounted for as a derivative with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
the fair market value of the purchase obligation and the fee is determined based on the present value of the estimated amount of future cash flows considering possible variations in the amount and or timing 
the fair value of the purchase obligation and the fee at january  is approximately   net of tax and minority interest 
we have reported the fee as interest income in the consolidated statement of earnings and the fair value as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended january  also in may  stapleton land entered into a total rate of return swap trs and an interest rate swap both with notional amounts of  stapleton land receives a rate of and pays bma plus basis points on the trs stapleton land paid bma plus basis points for the first months under this agreement

these libor based hedges as of february  protect the debt currently outstanding as well as the anticipated increase in debt outstanding for projects under development or anticipated to be under development during the year ending january  subsequent to january   we purchased an additional libor cap with a notional amount of  at a strike rate for the period of march  through march  outside of lender hedging requirements that require the borrower to protect against significant fluctuations in interest rates  we generally do not hedge tax exempt debt because  since  the base rate of this type of financing has averaged and has never exceeded 
as of january   we have  of tax exempt caps at a weighted average strike rate of that have maturities through january in addition  there is a  tax exempt interest rate swap at that expires march in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  with the holder of several tax exempt bonds 
under the terms of the agreement  the holder pays of libor and we remit to or receive from the holder the difference between the bond market association bma index and of libor 
this agreement expires in december subsequent to january   we decided to terminate this interest rate swap agreement 
including properties accounted for under the equity method  a basis point increase in taxable interest rates would increase the annual pre tax interest cost for the next months of our taxable variable rate debt by approximately  at january  this increase is net of the protection provided by the interest rate swaps and long term contracts in place as of january  and contemplates the effects of interest rate floors on  of libor or prime based debt 
a portion of our taxable variable rate debt is related to construction loans for which the interest expense is capitalized 
although tax exempt rates generally increase in an amount that is smaller than corresponding changes in taxable interest rates  a basis point increase in tax exempt rates would increase the annual pre tax interest cost for the next months of our tax exempt variable rate debt by approximately  at january  from time to time  certain of our joint ventures the joint ventures enter into total rate of return swaps trs on various tax exempt fixed rate borrowings generally held within the joint ventures 
the trs convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower the cost of capital 
in exchange for a fixed rate  the trs require that the joint ventures pay a variable rate  generally equivalent to the bma rate 
additionally  the joint ventures have guaranteed the principal balance of the underlying borrowing 
any fluctuation in the value of the guarantee would be offset by the fluctuation in the value of the underlying borrowing  resulting in no financial impact to the joint ventures of the company 
at january   the aggregate notional amount of trs in which the joint ventures have an interest is approximately  the fair value of such contracts is immaterial at january  and we believe the economic return and related risk associated with a trs is generally comparable to that of nonrecourse variable rate mortgage debt

these guarantees were entered into prior to january   and therefore  have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january   pursuant to the provisions of fin no 
at january   the maximum potential amount of future payments on these operating deficit guarantees we could be required to make was approximately  we would seek to recover any amounts paid through refinancing or sales proceeds of the apartment project 
these partnerships typically require us to indemnify  on an after tax or grossed up basis  the investment partner against the failure to receive  or the loss of allocated tax credits and tax losses 
at january   the maximum potential payment under these tax indemnity guarantees was approximately  we believe that all necessary requirements for qualifications for such tax credits have been and will be met and that our investment partners will be able to receive expense allocations associated with the properties 
we have obtained legal opinions from nationally recognized law firms supporting the validity of the tax credits 
we do not expect to make any payments under these guarantees

these carve out items enable the lenders to seek recourse if we or the joint venture commit fraud  voluntarily file for bankruptcy  intentionally misapply funds  transfer title without lender consent  or intentionally misrepresent facts 
we have also provided certain environmental guarantees 
under these environmental remediation guarantees  we must remediate any hazardous materials brought onto the property in violation of environmental laws 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is limited to the actual losses suffered or actual remediation costs incurred 
a portion of these carve outs and guarantees have been made on behalf of joint ventures and while the amount of the potential liability is currently indeterminable  we believe any liability would not exceed our partners share of the outstanding principal balance of the loans in which these carve outs and environmental guarantees have been made 
at january   the outstanding balance of the partners share of these loans was approximately  we believe the risk of payment on the carve out guarantees is mitigated in most cases by the fact we manage the property  and in the event our partner did violate one of the carve out items  we would seek recovery from our partner for any payments we would make 
additionally  we further mitigate our exposure through environmental insurance and insurance coverage for items such as fraud

these indemnities generally were entered into prior to january   and therefore  have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january  in accordance with fin no 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is limited to the actual losses suffered 
we mitigate our exposure to loss related to these indemnities through insurance coverage

we have also entered into an environmental indemnity at one of our development projects whereby we agree to indemnify a third party for the cost of remediating any environmental condition

table of contents new accounting standards fin no 
r in january  fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities was issued 
in december  the fasb published a revision of the interpretation fin no 
r to clarify some of the provisions of fin no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in the consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds a variable interest in a vie consolidates the entity if the company s interest is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin no 
r also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
we implemented fin no 
r on february  previously  we adopted the consolidation requirements for vies created after january   and the disclosure provisions of the interpretation that were effective upon issuance 
as a result  we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of previously unconsolidated vies representing properties vies representing eight properties in residential group  five vies properties in commercial group  and one vie property in land development group 
of these vies  vies representing properties nine vies representing eight properties in residential group  four vies properties in commercial group  and one vie property in land development group that were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting have been fully consolidated 
the remaining vies representing one property ten vies in residential group and one vie property in commercial group that were previously accounted for using the cost method of accounting have also been fully consolidated 
in addition  five properties in the residential group  which were determined to be vies  have been deconsolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary of these properties 
although we are an equity investor in these properties  we lack certain decision making authority 
specifically  these properties are part of government sponsored housing programs that are administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
we determined through a review of the contractual agreements for these government sponsored programs that the decision making rights of hud  a non equity investor  are restrictive rights that have a significant impact on these five properties 
we determined that hud is the primary beneficiary of these vies because it is most closely associated with the vies 
the vies activities include providing affordable housing for those individuals that qualify as low income individuals which is also hud s primary goal  mission  or purpose 
consistent with the provisions fin no 
r  we do not consider the activities of these vies significant as they only have a de minimus effect on all the principal captions in the consolidated balance sheet 
we recorded a charge of   net of tax for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in accordance with fin no 
r  which resulted in a reduction of net earnings 
this charge consisted primarily of our share of accumulated depreciation and amortization expense of the newly consolidated vies that were previously accounted for on the cost method 
upon implementation of fin no 
r on february   we determined that we hold variable interests in other vies representing properties in residential group and one in land development group for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
of the residential entities  including the five that were previously consolidated have been subsequently deconsolidated as disclosed above in accordance with the provisions of fin no 
r 
we are involved with these unconsolidated vies as an equity holder  lender  management agent  or through other contractual relationships 
the maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these unconsolidated vies was limited to our recorded investments in those vies totaling approximately  at february   which are recorded as investments in and advances to affiliates

caps swaps average average period covered amount base rate amount base rate dollars in thousands swaps include long term libor contracts that have an initial maturity greater than six months
