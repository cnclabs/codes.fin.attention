the company generates relatively minor revenues from continuing monthly royalties based on sales by franchise stores  sign and fa ade rental fees  and the provision of certain maintenance  transportation  and construction services to the company s franchisees 
a typical store generally is not profitable for its first year of operation due to start up costs and usually will attain representative levels of sales and profits during its third or fourth year of operation 
casey s measures performance using trend analysis and same store comparisons on net sales and gross profit  with a focus on the following three categories of products sold by corporate stores gasoline  grocery other merchandise  and prepared food fountain 
comparisons are also made on operating expenses 
fluctuations in operating expenses are compared with the increase or decrease in gross profit 
wages are the primary component of operating expenses  and management believes that the company has appropriately aligned store manager compensation with store performance 
store growth is a priority of the company

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective judgments  often because of the need to estimate the effects of inherently uncertain factors 
inventory inventories  which consist of merchandise and gasoline  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for gasoline  cost is determined through the use of the first in  first out fifo method 
for merchandise inventories  cost is determined through the use of the last in  first out lifo method applied to inventory values determined primarily by the fifo method for warehouse inventories and the retail inventory method rim for store inventories 
rim is an averaging method widely used in the retail industry because of its practicality 
under rim  inventory valuations are at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to sales 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain management judgments and estimates that could affect the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
vendor allowances include rebates and other funds received from vendors to promote their products 
the company often receives such allowances on the basis of quantitative contract terms that vary by product and vendor or directly on the basis of purchases made 
rebates are recognized as reductions of inventory costs when purchases are made  reimbursements of an operating expense eg  advertising are recorded as reductions of the related expense 
during fiscal  the company implemented a change in accounting principle from valuing retail gasoline inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lifo method to using the fifo method 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
long lived assets the company periodically monitors under performing stores for an indication that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  including goodwill where applicable  an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset 
fair value is based on management s estimate of the amount that could be realized from the sale of assets in a current transaction between willing parties 
the estimate is derived from professional appraisals  offers  actual sale or disposition of assets subsequent to year end  and other indications of asset value 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  which for the company is generally on a store by store basis 
the company incurred a  impairment charge in addition to the loss on discontinued operations in fiscal self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  general liability  and automobile claims 
the self insurance claim liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
actuarial projections of the losses are employed due to the high degree of variability in the liability estimates 
some factors affecting the uncertainty of claims include the development time frame  settlement patterns  litigation and adjudication direction  and medical treatment and cost trends 
the liability is not discounted 
in fiscal  the company increased the self insurance reserve by  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business  most sales are for cash  cash from operations is the company s primary source of liquidity 
the company finances its inventory purchases primarily from normal trade credit aided by relatively rapid inventory turnover 
this turnover allows the company to conduct its operations without large amounts of cash and working capital 
as of april   the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 
to  primarily due to a large increase in accounts payable caused by higher priced gasoline 
the ratio at april  and at april  was to management believes that the company s current  bank line of credit together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the working capital needs of its business 
net cash provided by operations increased  in the year ended april   primarily because of decreases in inventories and in income taxes receivable  a loss on the sale of property and equipment  and the net addition of corporate stores 
cash used in investing in the year ended april  rose  due to an increase in the purchase of property and equipment 
cash used in financing was up  primarily because of larger long term debt payments and a dividend increase 
capital expenditures represent the single largest use of company funds 
management believes that by reinvesting in corporate stores  the company will be better able to respond to competitive challenges and increase operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  the company expended  for property and equipment  primarily for the construction  acquisition  and remodeling of corporate stores  compared with  in the prior year 
in fiscal  the company anticipates expending approximately  primarily from existing cash and funds generated by operations  for construction  acquisition  and remodeling of corporate stores

to date  the company has funded capital expenditures primarily from the proceeds of the sale of common stock  issuance of convertible subordinated debentures converted into shares of common stock in  the previously described senior notes  a mortgage note and through funds generated from operations 
future capital required to finance operations  improvements  and the anticipated growth in the number of corporate stores is expected to come from cash generated by operations  the bank line of credit  and additional long term debt or other securities as circumstances may dictate 
such capital needs are not expected to adversely affect liquidity 

table of contents the table below presents significant contractual obligations  including interest  of the company at april  senior notes mortgage notes capital lease obligations operating leases thereafter total senior notes mortgage notes capital lease obligations operating leases at april   the company was partially self insured for workers compensation claims in all states of its marketing territory and was also partially self insured for general liability and auto liability under an agreement that provides for annual stop loss limits equal to or exceeding approximately  to facilitate this agreement  letters of credit approximating  were issued and outstanding at april  on the insurance company s behalf 
the company renews the letters of credit on an annual basis 
forward looking statements this form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended 
forward looking statements represent the company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including i any statements regarding future sales and gross profit percentages  ii any statements regarding the continuation of historical trends  and iii any statements regarding the sufficiency of the company s cash balances and cash generated from operations and financing activities for the company s future liquidity and capital resource needs 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions that these statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitations the factors described in this form k 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements because they speak only of the company s views as of the statement dates 
although the company has attempted to list the important factors that presently affect the company s business and operating results  the company further cautions investors that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward looking statements  factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statements include  among others  the following competition the company s business is highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in terms of the numbers and type of retailers offering the products and services found in corporate stores 
many of the food including prepared foods and nonfood items similar or identical to those sold by the company are generally available from a variety of competitors in the communities served by corporate stores  and the company competes with other convenience store chains  gasoline stations  supermarkets  drug stores  discount stores  club stores  mass merchants  and fast food outlets with respect to the sale of prepared foods 
sales of such nongasoline items particularly prepared food items have contributed substantially to the company s gross profit from retail sales in recent years 
gasoline sales are also intensely competitive 
the company competes for gasoline sales with both independent and national brand gasoline stations  other convenience store chains  and several non traditional gasoline retailers such as supermarkets in specific markets 
some of these other gasoline retailers may have access 
table of contents to more favorable arrangements for gasoline supply then does the company or the firms that supply its stores 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  and other resources than the company  and  as a result  may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry 
gasoline operations gasoline sales are an important part of the company s revenue and earnings  and retail gasoline profit margins have a substantial impact on the company s net income 
profit margins on gasoline sales can be affected adversely by factors beyond the control of the company  including the supply of gasoline available in the retail gasoline market  uncertainty or volatility in the wholesale gasoline market  increases in wholesale gasoline costs generally during a period  and price competition from other gasoline marketers 
the market for crude oil and domestic wholesale petroleum products is volatile and is affected by general political conditions and instability in oil producing regions such as the middle east and venezuela 
the volatility of the wholesale gasoline market makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact of future wholesale cost fluctuation on the company s operating results and financial conditions 
these factors could materially affect the company s gasoline gallon volume  gasoline gross profit  and overall customer traffic levels at corporate stores 
any substantial decrease in profit margins on gasoline sales or in the number of gallons sold by corporate stores could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
the company purchases its gasoline from a variety of independent national and regional petroleum distributors 
although in recent years the company s suppliers have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of gasoline to meet the company s needs  unanticipated national and international events could result in a reduction of gasoline supplies available for distribution to the company 
any substantial curtailment in gasoline supplied to the company would reduce its gasoline sales 
further  management believes that a significant amount of the company s business results from the patronage of customers primarily desiring to purchase gasoline  accordingly  reduced gasoline supplies could adversely affect the sale of nongasoline items 
such factors could have a material adverse impact upon the company s earnings and operations 
tobacco products sales of tobacco products represent a significant portion of the company s revenues 
significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products as well as national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the united states could have an adverse effect on the demand for cigarettes sold by corporate stores 
the company attempts to pass price increases on to its customers  but competitive pressures in specific markets may prevent it from doing so 
these factors could materially affect the retail price of cigarettes  the volume of cigarettes sold by corporate stores  and overall customer traffic 
environmental compliance costs the united states environmental protection agency and several of the states in which the company does business have adopted laws and regulations relating to underground storage tanks used for petroleum products 
substantial costs have been incurred by the company in the past to comply with such laws and regulations  and additional substantial costs may be necessary in the future 
several states in which the company does business have trust fund programs with provisions for sharing or reimbursing corrective action or remediation costs 
any reimbursements received in respect to such costs typically are subject to statutory provisions requiring repayment of the reimbursed funds for any future noncompliance with upgrade provisions or other applicable laws 
although the company regularly accrues expenses for the estimated costs related to its future corrective action or remediation efforts  there can be no assurance that such accrued amounts will be sufficient to pay such costs or that the company has identified all environmental liabilities at all of its current store locations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial expenditures in the future for remediation of contamination or related claims that have not been discovered or asserted with respect to existing store locations or locations that the company may acquire in the future  that the company will not be subject to any claims for reimbursement of funds disbursed to the company under the various state programs  and or that additional regulations or amendments to existing regulations will not require additional expenditures beyond those presently anticipated 
seasonality of sales company sales generally are strongest during its first two fiscal quarters may october and weakest during its third and fourth fiscal quarters november april 
in the warmer months  customers tend to purchase greater quantities of gasoline and certain convenience items such as beer  soft drinks  and ice 
difficult weather conditions such as flooding  prolonged rain  or snowstorms in any quarter however  may adversely reduce sales at affected corporate stores and may have an adverse impact on the company s earnings for that period 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
the company places its investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  the company s first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  the company seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the company believes an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting the company s floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of april  would have no material effect on pretax earnings 
the company uses a variety of derivative instruments such as options and futures to hedge against the volatility of gasoline cost 
the company is at risk for possible changes in the market value for these derivative instruments 
it is anticipated that such risk would be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged items 
market risks associated with all of the company s derivative contracts are reviewed regularly by management 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information concerning the company s use of derivative instruments
