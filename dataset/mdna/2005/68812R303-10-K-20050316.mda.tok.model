overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the clinical development and commercialization of new therapeutics to serve unmet medical needs 
on february   we completed our merger with genesoft pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held pharmaceutical company based in south san francisco  california 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase by us under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
under the purchase method of accounting  we are considered the acquirer and the assets and liabilities of genesoft were recorded  as of the date of the merger  february   at their respective fair values and added to those of our company 
reported financial condition and results of operations of our company issued after february  reflect genesoft s balances and results of operations after completion of the merger  but have not been restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of genesoft 
following february   the earnings of the combined company reflect purchase accounting adjustments  including in process research and development charges and amortization and depreciation expense for acquired tangible and intangible assets 
the most significant of the intangible assets identified have finite lives and relate to factive 
these amounts will be amortized over their expected useful lives 
goodwill has also been recorded  however  pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill will not be amortized but subjected to annual impairment review 
the company s lead product is the fluoroquinolone antibiotic factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets  indicated for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity and acute bacterial 
table of contents exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 
the commercial sale of factive began in september for the near term  we intend to focus our efforts on commercial sales of factive tablets for these indications as well as clinical trials for other indications of factive 
the company completed its initial recruitment of over one hundred sales and marketing professionals in september to launch the sale of factive tablets 
shortly after launch  the company announced the expansion of the sales force to two hundred fifty sales representatives  through the hiring of an additional one hundred fifty sales and marketing professionals  to support a nationwide sales force for factive 
this expansion is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter in in addition  we are developing a novel investigational antibiotic candidate  ramoplanin  which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of a serious hospital acquired infection 
on august   we announced preliminary results of our phase ii trial of ramoplanin for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
pending discussions with the fda  regarding a special protocol assessment  which was submitted in late and completion of discussions on timing of the clinical development program with our partner  vicuron  the program will be ready to commence a phase iii trial 
the phase iii clinical trial of ramoplanin for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre was closed early  in july  due to slow enrollment 
we intend to analyze the results of the vre trial and make a determination at a later date as to any future course of action for this indication 
in past fiscal years  we also received revenues from our genomics services business from selling  as a contract service business  high quality genomic sequencing information to our customers 
as part of our continued evolution into a product focused  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company  on march   we completed the sale of our genomics services business to privately held agencourt bioscience corporation agencourt 
as part of the agreement  we transferred our sequencing operations  including certain equipment and personnel to agencourt 
we received an up front cash payment of  and shares of agencourt s common stock 
we will also receive a percentage of revenues from our former commercial and government customers  transferred to agencourt  for a period of two years from the date of sale 
we retain rights to our pathogenome database product  including all associated intellectual property  subscriptions and royalty rights on products developed by subscribers 
as of december   we have received a total of  from agencourt since march  previously  we received payments from our product discovery alliances based on license fees  contract research and milestone payments during the term of our alliances 
we anticipate that our alliances will result in the discovery and commercialization of novel pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  it will be necessary for our alliance partner to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  obtain regulatory clearances  manufacture  sell  and distribute the product 
accordingly  we do not expect to receive royalties based upon product revenues for many years  if at all 
we expect the majority of our revenue in the future to be derived through the sale of factive tablets 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future due to the expansion of manufacturing  distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  as well as continued research and development efforts including clinical trials 
commercialization of factive during the second half of  we built a sales and marketing force and launched factive tablets on september  our ability to successfully commercialize factive tablets is subject to a number of risks  including the ability of our manufacturing partners to timely produce the needed quantities of the drug in compliance with regulations and competition in the marketplace from other anti infective products 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize factive tablets  our operations  financial position and liquidity would be negatively affected to a significant degree 

table of contents major research and development projects research and development expenditures totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets expenses for ongoing clinical trials and other development activities for the factive product totaled approximately  in development activity and associated expense for this product did not commence until the first quarter of following our acquisition of an exclusive license for the product 
ramoplanin our ongoing clinical trials and other development activities for ramoplanin have constituted our most significant research and development projects comprising  and of total research and development expenditures for fiscal years  and  respectively 
expenses for ramoplanin have comprised of the total research and development expense since inception of the project 
genomics based research alliances prior to the merger with genesoft  the company conducted genomics based research internally and through alliance partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and government grants 
the company also maintained a genomics services business 
the company has now exited these businesses and no longer conducts research in these areas 
in the expense to support these efforts was only of total research and development investment 
in contrast  the research and development expense to support these alliances was and of total research and development expenses for fiscal years ended and  respectively 
research and development expense to support our alliances was of the total research and development expense from january  through december  our research phase for all our alliances ended on or before april  a summary of the specific biopharmaceutical alliances that have composed our research and development program  including date initiated  alliance goal and status estimated  follows biopharmaceutical alliances goal status astrazeneca  august develop pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products effective against gastrointestinal infections or any other disease caused by helicobacter pylori h

amgen  december identify and develop novel therapeutic agents for bone diseases  including osteoporosis based on our genetic research 
both companies agreed to conclude the research collaboration effective april  with the conclusion of this research program  we will retain certain intellectual property and licensing rights related to the gene discovery made under this alliance 
our ability to obtain the goal for each of these alliances is subject to numerous risks 
we are heavily dependent upon our alliance partners to carry out product discovery  clinical development and commercialization activities 
our success in achieving our goals and obtaining further milestone payments depends  for example  upon whether our alliance partner identifies any compounds  through high throughput screening and lead optimization that warrant clinical development  whether any such compounds demonstrate the required safety and efficacy in clinical trials in order to support a regulatory approval and whether they are able to successfully manufacture and commercialize the product 
due to these uncertainties  we can not be certain if we will obtain additional milestone payments under our alliances or predict when material cash inflows from products generated by these alliances will commence  if ever 
internally funded research program as part of our strategic decision to concentrate on development and commercialization of our own products  we initiated a plan in to substantially reduce our research effort in internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
under this plan  we eliminated full time positions and paid out  related to severance costs against the restructuring liability in this charge includes associated severance costs  outplacement services and a non cash charge for the acceleration of vesting of previously granted stock options  as well as impairment charges related to the value of laboratory and computer equipment no longer used in operations

these efforts comprised of the total research and development expense from january  through december  
table of contents critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition principal source of revenue is the sale of factive tablets  which began shipping in the third quarter of other sources of revenue include biopharmaceutical and genomic services 
we expect our revenues derived from both our biopharmaceutical alliance and genomics services to continue to decrease in comparison to prior years and an increase in product revenues based on the launch of the sale of our factive tablets in september of inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
as of december   inventory consists of factive raw material in powder form and work in process and factive finished tablets to be used for sample and commercial sale related to the product launch of factive in september on a quarterly basis  the company analyzes its inventory levels  and writes down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory that is in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory will be disposed of and the related costs will be written off 
at december   there is approximately  of inventory that relates to validation lots and active pharmaceutical ingredients that are not yet saleable until the fda acceptance of our manufacturing site at patheon 
this approval is expected in the second quarter of product sales  net we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition and we recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
for arrangements where risk of loss has not passed to the wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed 
sales rebates  discounts and incentives our product sales are subject to various rebates  discounts and incentives that are customary in the pharmaceutical industry 
during the third quarter of  we offered certain product stocking incentives to several pharmacies 
these incentives included units with limited guaranteed sales provisions 
as a result of these provisions  title and risk of loss of these units has not passed to the customer 
accordingly  we have deferred all revenue related to these units until such time as the unit is provided to a patient with a prescription 
as of december   we have recorded deferred revenue of  related to these units 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a sample card program whereby we offered an incentive to patients in the form of free full course sample card 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with 
table of contents emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf 
as of december   we did not have sufficient history with these types of incentive programs in order to develop a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount of reimbursement claims that we expect to realize 
as a result  we have recorded the maximum liability redemption for reimbursement claims related to sample cards offered as of december  the company will adjust the liability upon completion of the program and may be able to consider the actual redemption rate in estimating the liability for similar programs in the future 
our product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of our product 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  wholesaler chargebacks  cash discounts  and administrative fees 
we estimate wholesaler chargebacks  cash discounts  administrative fees and other rebates by considering the following factors current contract prices and terms  estimated customer and wholesaler inventory levels and current average chargeback rates 
our process to estimate product returns includes the remaining shelf life and the product life cycle stage 
we estimate product return allowances based on historical information for similar or competing products in the same distribution channel 
we obtain and evaluate product return data from distributors and  based on this evaluation  estimate return rates 
the reserves are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time 
to the extent the company s estimates of contractual allowances  rebates and sales returns are different from actuals  the company adjusts the reserve which impacts the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment 
the company has not received any significant returns through december  genomics based research alliances and genomics services genomics based research and alliances revenues have consisted of government grants  license fees and contract research and milestone payments from alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
genomics services revenues have consisted of government grants  fees and royalties received from custom gene sequencing and analysis services and subscription fees from the pathogenome database 
revenues from contract research  government grants  and custom gene sequencing and analysis services are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the percentage of services performed related to contract research  government grants and custom gene sequencing and analysis services is based on the ratio of the number of direct labor hours performed to date to total direct labor hours we are obligated to perform under the related contract  as determined on a full time equivalent basis 
revenues from pathogenome database subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
amounts received for license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone as long as the milestone is non refundable  is deemed to be substantive and we have no other performance obligations related to the milestone 
unbilled costs and fees represent revenue recognized prior to billing 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
clinical trial expense accrual the company s clinical development trials related to ramoplanin and factive are primarily conducted by third party research organizations 
at the end of each accounting period  the company estimates both the total cost and time period of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
the company also adjusts these estimates when final invoices are received 
in july  the company decided  due to slow enrollment  to close enrollment on its phase iii clinical trial of ramoplanin for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre prior to completion of the study 
the company believes all actual and estimated costs to complete the phase iii trial are reflected in the accrual at december  however  
table of contents readers should be cautioned that the possibility exists that the timing of the clinical trials might be longer or shorter and the cost could be more or less than we have estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
for the clinical development of ramoplanin and factive  the company recorded expenses of approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
restructuring charges during the years ended december  and  the company recorded restructuring charges of  and  respectively 
the company also recorded a facility lease liability of  during the year ended december  in connection with the acquisition of genesoft 
we established exit plans for activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and eitf issue no 
recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgemental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including respect to contractual rental commitments for office and laboratory space being vacated and related costs  leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental market changes  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we determined that the probability of subleasing our vacant space had decreased 
this caused us to lower our sublease income estimate and increase our estimated liability for the fair value of the remaining lease rentals by approximately  if we are able to identify a sublease tenant  enter into a favorable lease buy out or otherwise reassess our use of the vacant space  we may be required to further revise the restructuring accrual that we have recorded as of december  for further discussion on our restructuring activities  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  product sales increased to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to the commercial launch of factive tablets in september product sales of factive tablets accounted for more than of net revenues in biopharmaceutical revenues decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to the reduction of revenues from alliances as a result of the conclusion of research agreements 
we expect our revenues derived from our biopharmaceutical alliances to continue to decrease in comparison to prior years and not have a material impact on future revenues and expect an increase in commercial product revenues as a result of our launch of factive tablets in the second half of 
table of contents costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  in cost of product sales increased to  in from in due to the launch of factive tablets in september included in the cost of product sales is  of amortization of intangible assets associated with factive 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in research and development activities include clinical trials  other clinical development  technology transfer and process optimization for manufacturing  and early stage research and development funded internally as well as by government grants and strategic alliances 
these research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel  amortization of intangible assets and the cost of materials used in sequencing activities and research and development 
other research and development expenses include fees paid to consultants and outside service providers 
the increase in research and development is primarily due to an increase of approximately  in connection with the start of clinical trials for factive related to the day cap study and the factive intravenous formulation study as well as an increase of  in connection with the feasibility testing of factive manufacturing in a new contracted manufacturing site 
partially offsetting these increases are a decrease of approximately  in connection with the termination of the ramoplanin vre trial in july  as well as decreases of  and  in cost of biopharmaceuticals revenues and internal research effort  respectively 
as part of our merger with genesoft  we recorded a one time non cash charge of  related to in process research and development expenses associated with internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
the valuation of the in process research and development represents a peptide dformylase inhibitor research program pdf for the development of gsq and oral pdf inhibitors  licensed from vernalis for the treatment of community acquired infections 
in process research and development also includes three novel metalloenzyme bacterial targets from vernalis 
continued efforts on and success of these programs are contingent on securing a partnership with another organization 
this non cash charge was determined in the allocation for the purchase price of genesoft 
selling  general and administrative expenses significantly increased to  in from  in this increase was due to additional sales and marketing personnel and associated hiring and consulting costs of  increased other selling and marketing costs of approximately  to support the launch of factive  increased advertising and promotional costs of  increased general and administrative personnel  hiring and consulting costs of approximately  and increased legal and patent costs of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the first half of as we continue to expand our commercialization efforts related to factive to support a national sales campaign 
stock based compensation increased to  in from  in the increase is due to higher amortization of deferred compensation resulting from stock options being issued primarily at the merger  and then the expense being accelerated due to terminations of various personnel in the periods subsequent to the merger completed with genesoft in february restructuring charges decreased to  for the year in from  in in  we recorded restructuring charges of  for the impairment of the beaver street waltham ma facility and associated leasehold improvements and  for severance costs

in addition  we also had tax credit carryforwards of approximately  to reduce federal and state income tax  if any 
net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period in excess of 
additionally  certain of our losses have begun to expire due to time  not limitations 
we believe that  under our current rate of investment in development programs  as well as our effort to launch factive  that our existing capital resources as of december  are adequate for at least the next two years of operations 
there is no assurance  however  that changes in our plans or events affecting our operations will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a significant increase in hiring as we build a sales and marketing organization in order to launch factive tablets  expand the medical development organization to support additional factive development and commercialization  continue support for the development of ramoplanin and build the infrastructure necessary to support these expansions 
we would expect growth  particularly in the sales and marketing areas  to continue into the first quarter of and we are in the process of hiring additional personnel to reach a total of sales professionals to support nationwide sales coverage for factive 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our convertible promissory notes and our facility leases 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands thereafter total operating leases sublease contracted income current sublease forecasts a term loan convertible promissory notes b total forecasted contractual obligations a the current market reflects lower demand and cost for space  as well as shorter term leases 
b upon the closing of the genesoft merger  we exchanged approximately million of company convertible promissory notes for a like principal amount of genesoft promissory notes 
the convertible promissory notes bear an interest rate of compounded semi annually and have a maturity date of five years from the closing date 
the convertible promissory notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the holder s election at any time at a price per share equal to  subject to subsequent adjustment 
in addition  following the one year anniversary of the closing of the merger  we will have the right to force conversion if the price of our common stock closes above of the then effective conversion price for consecutive trading days 
the convertible promissory notes payable of million at maturity date includes million of accrued interest payable 
table of contents in the quarter ended june   the company issued  in principal amount of our senior convertible promissory notes due april these notes are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holders at a conversion price of per share 
the company may not redeem the notes at its election before may  after this date  the company can redeem all or a part of the notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon the occurrence of a change of control or a termination of trading of our common stock each as defined in the indenture for the notes  holders of our notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
risk factors some of the important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following risks related to our business we have a history of significant operating losses and expect these losses to continue in the future 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
we had a net loss of approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we had a net loss of approximately  for the fiscal year ended december   and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  for the fiscal year ended december   we had a net loss of approximately  and for the fiscal year ended december   we had a net loss of approximately  the losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in research and development  including our clinical trials  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations  prior to  and product sales of factive tablets 
these costs have exceeded our revenues which to date have been generated principally from collaborations  government grants and sequencing services 
we anticipate that we will incur additional losses in the current year and in future years and cannot predict when  if ever  we will achieve profitability 
these losses are expected to continue and potentially increase as we continue significant levels of expenditures  principally in the sales and marketing area as we seek to grow sales of factive tablets and in research and development in connection with clinical trials and formulation activities to support the existing labeling of factive tablets and potentially the expanded factive labeling claims 
in addition  our partners product development efforts which utilize our genomic discoveries are at an early stage and  accordingly  we do not expect our losses to be substantially mitigated by revenues from milestone payments or royalties under those agreements for a number of years  if ever 
our business will be very dependent on the commercial success of factive tablets 
factive tablets are currently our only commercial product and we expect will likely account for substantially all of our product revenues for at least the next several years 
factive tablets have fda marketing approval for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity  or cap  and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  or aecb 
the commercial success of factive tablets will depend upon their continued acceptance by regulators  physicians  patients and other key decision makers as a safe  therapeutic and cost effective alternative to other anti infectives and other products used  or currently being developed  to treat cap and aecb 
if factive tablets are not commercially successful  we will have to find additional sources of funding or curtail or cease operations 
in december  the fda issued a non approvable letter to the prior owner of rights to factive due  in part  to safety concerns arising out of an increased rate of rash relative to comparator drugs  especially in young women 
while the fda did approve factive tablets for marketing in april  it required  as a 
table of contents postmarketing study commitment  that we conduct a prospective  randomized study comparing the factive tablet  patients to an active comparator  patients in patients with cap or aecb 
this study will include patients of different ethnicities  to gain safety information in populations not substantially represented in the existing clinical trial program  specifically as it relates to rash 
patients will be evaluated for clinical and laboratory safety 
this phase iv trial  with the approval from the fda  was initiated in the second half of in connection with the approval of factive tablets  the fda has also required us to obtain data on the prescribing patterns and use of factive tablets for the first three years after their initial marketing in the us as part of this requirement  we will furnish periodic reports to the fda on the number of prescriptions issued  including refills  and the diagnoses for which the prescriptions are dispensed 
the results of the phase iv trial and the periodic reports we are required to provide to the fda  as well as other safety information arising out of the marketing of the product  could restrict our ability to commercialize factive tablets 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future 
we believe our existing funds and anticipated cash flows from operations would be sufficient to support our current plans for at least months 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations  in particular  to support our sales and marketing activities  fund clinical trials and other research and development activities  and other potential commercial or development opportunities we may seek funding through additional public or private equity offerings  debt financings or agreements with customers 
our ability to raise additional capital  however  will be heavily influenced by  among other factors  the investment market for biopharmaceutical companies and the progress of the factive and ramoplanin commercial and clinical development programs over that period 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed  or  if available  may not be available on favorable terms 
if we cannot obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms when such financing is required  our business will be adversely affected 
future fund raising could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 
in order to raise additional funds  we may issue equity or convertible debt securities in the future 
depending upon the market price of our shares at the time of any transaction  we may be required to sell a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock in order to fund our operating plans  potentially requiring a stockholder vote 
in addition  we may have to sell securities at a discount to the prevailing market price  resulting in further dilution to our stockholders 
we will need to develop marketing and sales capabilities to successfully commercialize factive tablets and our other product candidates 
factive tablets are our first fda approved product 
to date  we still have limited marketing and sales experience considering the launch of factive occurred september of the continued development of these marketing and sales capabilities will require significant expenditures  management resources and time 
failure to successfully establish sufficient sales and marketing capability in a timely and regulatory compliant manner or to find suitable sales and marketing partners may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we will depend on third parties to manufacture and distribute our product and product candidates  including factive tablets and ramoplanin 
we do not have the internal capability to manufacture pharmaceutical products under the fda s current good manufacturing practices 
under our agreement with lg life sciences they manufacture bulk quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of factive 
although the lg life sciences facilities have previously been inspected by the fda  future inspections may find deficiencies in the facilities or processes that may delay or prevent the manufacture or sale of factive tablets 

table of contents we are seeking to qualify patheon  inc as a manufacturer to provide finished factive tablets  replacing sb pharmaco 
we estimate that patheon will obtain the necessary fda qualifications to be the fill and finish provider during the first half of the company expects that the quantities of factive tablets currently on hand  in combination with the quantities to be delivered from sb pharmco under their current obligations  will provide sufficient inventory until patheon can be qualified 
however  if there is significant delay in the qualification of patheon  we could have insufficient inventory of factive tablets to meet demand which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that sb pharmco will be able to avoid batch failures or production delays for their outstanding commitments 
we cannot be certain that lg life sciences  patheon  vicuron or future manufacturers will be able to deliver commercial quantities of product candidates to us or that such deliveries will be made on a timely basis 
the only source of supply for factive bulk drug product is lg life sciences facility in south korea  and upon fda qualification  patheon will be our only source of finished factive tablets 
if these facilities are damaged or otherwise unavailable  we would incur substantial costs and delay in the commercialization of factive tablets 
if we are forced to find an alternative source for ramoplanin or other product candidates  we could also incur substantial costs and delays in the further commercialization of such products 
we may not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
also  if we change the source or location of supply or modify the manufacturing process  regulatory authorities will require us to demonstrate that the product produced by the new source or from the modified process is equivalent to the product used in any clinical trials that we had conducted 
moreover  while we may choose to manufacture products in the future  we have no experience in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for clinical trials or commercial purposes 
if we decide to manufacture products  it would be subject to the regulatory requirements described above 
in addition  we would require substantial additional capital and would be subject to delays or difficulties encountered in manufacturing pharmaceutical products 
no matter who manufactures the products  we will be subject to continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post market information 
we will depend on third parties to manage our product supply chain for factive tablets 
we do not have the internal capability to perform product supply chain services including warehousing  inventory management and distribution of commercial and sample quantities of factive tablets 
in june  we entered into an exclusive agreement with integrated commercial solutions  inc ics  to perform such supply chain manufacturing services for a three year period 
we cannot be certain that ics will be able to perform uninterrupted supply chain services throughout the term of the agreement 
as our exclusive supply chain service provider if ics were unable to perform their services for any period  we may incur substantial loss of sales to wholesalers and other purchasers of factive tablets 
if we are forced to find an alternative supply chain service provider  in addition to loss of sales  we may also incur costs in establishing a new arrangement 
we cannot expand the indications for which we will market factive unless we receive fda approval for each additional indication 
failure to expand these indications will limit the size of the commercial market for factive 
in april  factive tablets were approved by the fda for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 
one of our objectives of ours is to expand the indications for which factive is approved for marketing by the fda  including for the indication of acute bacterial sinusitis 
while we believe the necessary clinical trials for acute bacterial sinusitis have been completed  we are gathering additional data based on the use of factive following commercial launch to supplement an nda filing for acute bacterial sinusitis abs 
we cannot be certain how much additional data will be required or whether we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials in order 
table of contents to market factive for this indication 
in order to market factive for other indications  we will need to conduct additional clinical trials  obtain positive results from those trials and obtain fda approval for such proposed indications 
if we are unsuccessful in expanding the approved indications for the use of factive  the size of the commercial market for factive will be limited 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing factive abroad 
in order to market factive in the european union and other foreign jurisdictions for which we have rights to market the product  we or our distribution partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals 
obtaining foreign approvals may require additional trials and expense 
we may not be able to obtain approval or may be delayed in obtaining approval from any or all of the jurisdictions in which we seek approval to market factive 
sales of factive in european countries in which we do not have rights to market the product could adversely affect sales in the european countries in which we have exclusive rights to market the product 
our exclusive rights to market factive in europe are limited to france  germany  the united kingdom  luxembourg  ireland  italy  spain  portugal  belgium  the netherlands  austria  greece  sweden  denmark  finland  norway  iceland  switzerland  andorra  monaco  san marino and vatican city 
these countries include the current members of the european union 
however  in the future  a number of additional european countries in which we do not have rights to market factive may be admitted as members of the european union 
if lg life sciences were to sell factive or license a third party to sell factive in such countries after they are admitted to the european union  our ability to maintain our projected profit margins based on sales in the territories covered by the lg life sciences license agreement may be adversely affected because customers in our territory may purchase factive from neighboring countries in the european union and our ability to prohibit such purchases may be limited under european union antitrust restrictions 
failure to secure distribution partners in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing factive abroad 
we intend to market factive through distribution partners in most  if not all  of the international markets for which we have a license to market the product 
this will include the european union  canada and mexico 
we may not be able to secure distribution partners at all  or those that we do secure may not be successful in marketing and distributing factive 
if we are not able to secure distribution partners or those partners are unsuccessful in their efforts  it would significantly limit the revenues that we expect to obtain from the sales of factive 
the development and commercialization of our products may be terminated or delayed  and the costs of development and commercialization may increase  if third parties who we rely on to manufacture and support the development and commercialization of our products do not fulfill their obligations 
our development and commercialization strategy entails entering into arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators  contract research organizations  distributors  third party manufacturers  licensors  licensees and others to conduct development work  manage our clinical trials  manufacture our products and market and sell our products outside of the united states 
we will not have the expertise or the resources to conduct such activities on our own and  as a result  we will be particularly dependent on third parties in these areas 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements with respect to the commercialization of factive or establish and maintain arrangements to develop and commercialize ramoplanin or any additional product candidates or products we may acquire on terms that are acceptable to us 
any current or future arrangements for development and commercialization may not be successful 
if we are not able to establish or maintain agreements relating to factive  ramoplanin or any additional products we may acquire on terms which we deem favorable  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents third parties may not perform their obligations as expected 
the amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to developing  manufacturing and commercializing our products are not within our control 
furthermore  our interests may differ from those of third parties that manufacture or commercialize our products 
disagreements that may arise with these third parties could delay or lead to the termination of the development or commercialization of our product candidates  or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
if any third party that manufactures or supports the development or commercialization of our products breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to conduct its activities in a timely and regulatory compliant manner  such breach  termination or failure could delay or otherwise adversely impact the development or commercialization of factive tablets  ramoplanin  our other product candidates or any additional product candidates that we may acquire or develop  require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote unforeseen additional resources to the development or commercialization of our products  or result in the termination of the development or commercialization of our products 
clinical trials are costly  time consuming and unpredictable  and we have limited experience conducting and managing necessary preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates 
our lead product  factive tablets  is currently conducting a phase iv post approval clinical trial in compliance with fda requirements pursuant to the product s approval and a phase iii clinical trial for a five day course of therapy for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity 
additionally  clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval to market the product for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis 
additional clinical trials will be required to gain approval to market factive for other indications formulations 
the phase ii trial for our lead product candidate  ramoplanin  to assess the safety and efficacy to treat clostridium difficile associated diarrhea  or cdad  was completed in pending completion of discussions with the fda regarding a special protocol assessment submitted in late and completion of discussions with our partner  vicuron  concerning timelines required to complete the phase iii program and submission to the fda  the phase iii program will be ready for initiation 
prior clinical and preclinical trials for ramoplanin were conducted by biosearch italia spa and its licensees  from whom we acquired our license to develop ramoplanin 
we may not be able to complete these trials or make the filings within the timeframes we currently expect 
if we are delayed in completing the trials or making the filings  our business may be adversely affected  including as a result of increased costs 
we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of factive in indications other than those for which it has already been approved or of our other products including ramoplanin  in each case  to the satisfaction of the fda  or other regulatory authorities 
we may also be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represent an improved form of treatment over existing therapies and we may be unable to do so without conducting further clinical studies 
negative  inconclusive or inconsistent clinical trial results could prevent regulatory approval  increase the cost and timing of regulatory approval or require additional studies or a filing for a narrower indication 
the speed with which we are able to complete our clinical trials and our applications for marketing approval will depend on several factors  including the following the rate of patient enrollment  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and the nature of the protocol  
table of contents fluctuations in the infection rates for patients enrolled in our trials  compliance of patients and investigators with the protocol and applicable regulations  prior regulatory agency review and approval of our applications and procedures  analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities which are susceptible to varying interpretations  which interpretations could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval  changes in the policies of regulatory authorities for drug approval during the period of product development  and the availability of skilled and experienced staff to conduct and monitor clinical studies  to accurately collect data and to prepare the appropriate regulatory applications 
in addition  the cost of human clinical trials varies dramatically based on a number of factors  including the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  the extent of development and financial support from alliance partners  the number of patients required for enrollment  the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of the product candidate  and the difficulty in obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory marketing approvals 
we may not be able to obtain the approvals necessary to conduct clinical studies 
also  the results of our clinical trials may not be consistent with the results obtained in preclinical studies or the results obtained in later phases of clinical trials may not be consistent with those obtained in earlier phases 
a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in early animal and human testing 
if regulatory approval of a drug is granted  such approval is likely to limit the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
furthermore  even if a product gains regulatory approval  the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review  including the requirement to conduct post approval clinical studies 
we may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product  even after obtaining product approval  if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered 
our product candidates will face significant competition in the marketplace 
factive tablets are approved for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 
there are several classes of antibiotics that are primary competitors for the treatment of these indications  including other fluoroquinolones such as levaquin levofloxacin  a product of ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  tequin gatifloxacin  a product of bristol myers squibb company  and cipro ciprofloxacin and avelox moxifloxacin  both products of bayer corporation  macrolides such as biaxin clarithromycin  a product of abbott laboratories and zithromax azithromycin  a product of pfizer inc  and ketek  a ketolide from aventis pharmaceuticals  and penicillins such as augmentin amoxicillin clavulanate potassium  a product of glaxosmithkline 
many generic antibiotics are also currently prescribed to treat these infections 
moreover  a number of the antibiotic products that are competitors of factive tablets will be going off patent at dates ranging from to as these competitors lose patent protection  makers of generic drugs will likely begin to produce some of these competing products and this could result in pressure on the price at which we are able to sell factive tablets and reduce our profit margins 
ramoplanin is in clinical development for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
we are aware of two products currently utilized in the marketplace vanconin vancomycin  a 
table of contents product marketed by viropharma  and metronidazole  a generic product for treatment of this indication 
we are also aware of at least three companies with products in development for the treatment of cdad geltex genzyme in phase ii  immucell in phase i ii  and acambis in phase i ii 
it is also possible that other companies are developing competitive products for this indication 
we are aware that vicuron and novartis pharma are jointly developing pdf inhibitor agents that may compete with any pdf products developed by us 
all of our other internal product programs are in earlier stages and have not yet reached clinical development and are not yet indication specific 
our alliance related product development programs are also all in preclinical stages  and it is therefore not possible to identify any product profiles or competitors for these product development programs at this time 
our industry is very competitive and it therefore is likely that if and when product candidates from our early stage internal programs or our alliance programs reach the clinical development stage or are commercialized for sale  these products will also face competition 
many of our competitors will have substantially greater capital resources  facilities and human resources than us 
furthermore  many of those competitors are more experienced than us in drug discovery  development and commercialization  and in obtaining regulatory approvals 
as a result  those competitors may discover  develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products or services before us 
in addition  our competitors may discover  develop and commercialize products or services that are more effective than  or otherwise render non competitive or obsolete  the products or services that we or our collaborators are seeking to develop and commercialize 
moreover  these competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our rights or the ability of our collaborators to develop or commercialize pharmaceutical products or services 
we will rely upon alliance partners from our previous genomics based research alliance business as a means of developing and commercializing our products 
our strategy for developing and commercializing therapeutic  vaccine and diagnostic products from our previous genomics based research and alliance business depends  in part  on strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
we currently have alliances with astrazeneca  biomerieux  schering plough and wyeth 
over the past several years  we have received a substantial portion of our revenue from these alliances 
however  our research obligations under our strategic alliances have been fulfilled 
as a result  any substantial additional revenues under these alliances will consist of milestone payments based on the achievement by the alliance partner of development milestones or royalties based on the sale of products arising from the alliance 
the achievement of any of the development milestones and successful development of any products under these alliances are dependent on the alliance partners activities and are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that any milestones will be attained  that any products will be successfully developed by the alliance partners or that we will receive any substantial additional revenues under these alliances 
if our partners develop products using our discoveries  we will rely on these partners for product development  regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of those products before we can receive some of the milestone payments  royalties and other payments to which we may be entitled under the terms of some of its alliance agreements 
our agreements with our partners typically allow the partners significant discretion in electing whether to pursue any of these activities 
we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources our partners may devote to our programs or potential products 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our partners will perform their obligations as expected 
our failure to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products will impair our ability to grow 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products 
the success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire biopharmaceutical 
table of contents products that meet our criteria 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
new product candidates acquired or in licensed by us may require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive preclinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  it is uncertain whether any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  or widely accepted in the marketplace 
we will depend on key personnel in a highly competitive market for skilled personnel 
we will be highly dependent on the principal members of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel 
the loss of any of our personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our goals 
we currently maintain employment agreements with the following senior officers steven m 
rauscher  president and chief executive officer  stephen cohen  senior vice president and chief financial officer  and gary patou  md  executive vice president  chief medical officer  nick colangelo  esq  senior vice president  corporate development and operations  and ton bunt  md  md  senior vice president  clinical development and medical affairs 
the term of each employment agreement continues until it is terminated by the officer or us  except for dr 
patou s agreement which runs through march   after which he becomes a consultant for one year 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified sales and marketing  clinical development  scientific and managerial personnel 
the plan to launch the commercial sale of factive tablets during the second half of has required us to significantly increase our hiring of new employees  primarily with expertise in the areas of sales and marketing 
we will continue to increase these efforts in the future 
like others in our industry  we may face  and in the past we have faced from time to time  difficulties in attracting and retaining certain employees with the requisite expertise and qualifications 
we believe that our historical recruiting periods and employee turnover rates are similar to those of others in our industry  however  we cannot be certain that we will not encounter greater difficulties in the future 
our intellectual property protection and other protections may be inadequate to protect our products 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims and protect our intellectual property 
we currently own or license approximately issued us patents  approximately pending us patent applications  issued foreign patents and approximately pending foreign patent applications 
these patents and patent applications primarily relate to the field of human and pathogen genetics  the chemical composition  use  and method of manufacturing factive  metalloenzyme inhibitors  their uses  and their targets  and dna nanobinder tm compounds and their use as anti infective therapeutics 
our material patents are as follows us patent no

 granted october   relating to methods of use of quinolone compounds against pneumococcal pathogenic bacteria  licensed from lg life science  expiring september  we are not currently involved in any litigation  settlement negotiations  or other legal action regarding patent issues and we are not aware of any patent litigation threatened against us 
our patent position involves complex legal and factual questions  and legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the applicable technology fields are still evolving 
therefore  the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
under our license agreement with lg life sciences  we obtained an exclusive license to develop and market gemifloxacin in certain territories 
this license covers issued us patents and a broad portfolio of corresponding foreign patents and pending patent applications 
these patents include claims that relate to the chemical composition of factive  methods of manufacturing and their use for the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections 
the us patents are currently set to expire at various dates  ranging from  in the case of the principal patents relating to factive  to we have filed patent term extension applications  covering the regulatory review process  for the principal patents 
if granted  these extensions would extend the exclusivity period through we also have the exclusive right to use factive trademarks  trade names  domain names and logos in conjunction with the use or sale of the product in the territories covered by the license 
lg life sciences  as owner of us patent nos 
 and  submitted requests for reexamination to the us patent trademark office  or pto  in order to place additional references into the record of each patent 
both requests were granted by the pto 
patent and have been reexamined with relatively minor modifications to the claims and confirmed patentable over the submitted references 
the patents that we license to ramoplanin under our agreement with vicuron include claims relating to methods of manufacturing ramoplanin as well as methods increasing the yield of the active compound 
we also 
table of contents have applications pending relating to various novel uses of ramoplanin 
the patent covering the chemical composition of ramoplanin has expired 
to provide additional protection for ramoplanin  we rely on proprietary know how relating to maximizing yields in the manufacture of ramoplanin  and intend to rely on the five year data exclusivity provisions under the hatch waxman act 
the risks and uncertainties that we will face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following the pending patent applications that we have filed or to which they have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than expected to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents which are issued may be limited from those in the patent applications and may not provide meaningful protection  we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our partners may not provide a competitive advantage  other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our partners  patents issued to other companies may harm our ability to do business  and other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies  and other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed 
we will bear substantial responsibilities under our license agreements for factive and ramoplanin  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully fulfill our responsibilities 
in connection with the merger  we have assumed genesoft s exclusive license from lg life sciences to develop and market factive in north america and france  germany  the united kingdom  luxembourg  ireland  italy  spain  portugal  belgium  the netherlands  austria  greece  sweden  denmark  finland  norway  iceland  switzerland  andorra  monaco  san marino and vatican city 
under this agreement  we are responsible  at our expense and through consultation with lg life sciences  for the clinical and commercial development of factive in the countries covered by the license  including the conduct of clinical trials  the filing of drug approval applications with the fda and other applicable regulatory authorities and the marketing  distribution and sale of factive in our territory  provided  that lg life sciences has the right to co promote the product on terms to be negotiated in our territory for and periods commencing thereafter  in which case our royalty obligations to lg life sciences would cease 
the agreement also requires a minimum sales commitment over a period of time  which if not met  would result in the technology being returned to lg life sciences 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the agreement with lg life sciences  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance due to the limitations on our resources and the many risks of conducting clinical trials  as described above in clinical trials are costly  time consuming and unpredictable  and we have limited experience conducting and managing necessary preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates and the challenges inherent in the commercialization of new products as described above in our product candidates will face significant competition in the marketplace 
lg life sciences has the obligation under the agreement to diligently maintain its patents and the patents of third parties to which it has rights that  in each case  relate to gemifloxacin  the active ingredient in factive tablets 
we have the right  at our expense  to control any litigation relating to suits brought by a third party alleging that the manufacture  use or sale of gemifloxacin in its licensed field in the territories covered by the license infringes upon our rights 
we also have the primary right to pursue actions for infringement of any patent licensed from lg life sciences under the license agreement within the territories covered by the license 
if we elect not to pursue any infringement action  lg life sciences has the right to pursue it 
the costs of any infringement actions are first paid out of any damages recovered 
if we are the plaintiff  the remainder of the damages are retained by us  subject to our royalty obligations to lg life sciences 
if lg life sciences is the plaintiff  the remainder of the 
table of contents damages are divided evenly between us and lg life sciences  subject to our royalty obligations to lg life sciences 
the costs of pursuing any such action could substantially diminish our resources 
under our agreement with vicuron  we have obtained an exclusive license to develop and market oral ramoplanin in the united states and canada 
under this agreement  we are responsible  at our expense  for the clinical and non clinical development of ramoplanin in our field  the prevention and treatment of human disease  in the united states and canada  including the conduct of clinical trials and the filing of drug approval applications with the fda and other applicable regulatory authorities 
we are obligated under the agreement to work diligently to develop ramoplanin and if we do not file an nda for ramoplanin by a date to be agreed upon by us and vicuron  vicuron would have the right to terminate our license to ramoplanin 
on november   we received a letter from vicuron pharmaceuticals inc indicating that they intend to seek to terminate the license and supply agreement between vicuron and oscient and reacquire rights to ramoplanin 
in their letter  vicuron claims that it will have a right to terminate the agreement based on the fact that an nda with respect to ramoplanin is not expected to be filed with the fda prior to the date originally specified in the agreement 
we believe their letter contradicts an amendment to the agreement entered into in october of filed as exhibit to our annual report on form k filed with the sec on march   and we have addressed this issue with vicuron 
pursuant to the terms of the amended agreement  we are in discussions with vicuron to develop a timetable for the completion of development and outside date for the nda submission 
there is no assurance we will be able to agree upon such a date  that vicuron will not renew its attempt to terminate the agreement again in the future or that we will prevail in any potential dispute with vicuron 
vicuron is responsible for providing us with all information in its possession relating to ramoplanin in our licensed field  for cooperating with us in obtaining regulatory approvals of ramoplanin and for using diligent efforts to provide us with bulk ramoplanin sufficient to carry out our clinical development activities 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the license and supply agreement  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance due to the limitations on our resources and the many risks of conducting clinical trials  as described above in clinical trials are costly  time consuming and unpredictable  and we have limited experience conducting and managing necessary preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates 
under our agreement with vicuron  vicuron has the obligation to prosecute patents relating to ramoplanin that are made by vicuron personnel or conceived jointly by our personnel and vicuron s personnel 
we have the obligation to prosecute patents relating to ramoplanin that are made solely by our personnel 
we have the right to control any suits brought by a third party alleging that the manufacture  use or sale of ramoplanin in our licensed field in the united states or canada infringes upon our rights 
we will bear the costs of any such actions  which could be substantial  provided that if we are obligated to pay any royalties or other payments to a third party to sell ramoplanin as a result of this litigation  including any settlement reached with vicuron s consent  vicuron is obligated to pay that expense 
we also have the primary right to pursue actions for infringement of any patent licensed from vicuron within the united states and canada within our licensed field 
vicuron has the primary right to pursue actions for infringement of any patents that it licenses to us outside of our licensed field within the united states and canada and for all purposes outside of the united states and canada 
if the party with the primary right to pursue the infringement action elects not to pursue it  the other party generally has the right to pursue it 
the costs of any infringement actions are first paid out of any damages recovered and are then allocated to the parties depending upon their interest in the suit 
the costs of pursuing any such action could substantially diminish our resources 
our proprietary position may depend on our ability to protect trade secrets 
we rely upon trademarks  unpatented trade secrets and improvements  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we generally protect this information with confidentiality agreements that provide that all confidential information developed or made known to others during the course of the employment  consulting or business relationship shall be kept 
table of contents confidential except in specified circumstances 
agreements with employees provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while employed by us are our exclusive property 
we cannot guarantee  however  that these agreements will be honored  that we will have adequate remedies for breach if they are not honored or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
we may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties and may become involved in expensive intellectual property litigation 
the intellectual property rights of biotechnology companies  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
our success in developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products may depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our intellectual property rights 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the biopharmaceutical industry 
we may become party to patent litigation or proceedings at the us patent and trademark office or a foreign patent office to determine our patent rights with respect to third parties which may include competitors in the biopharmaceutical industry 
interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office or opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office may be necessary to establish which party was the first to discover such intellectual property 
we may become involved in patent litigation against third parties to enforce our patent rights  to invalidate patents held by such third parties  or to defend against such claims 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or similar proceeding could be substantial  and it may absorb significant management time 
we do not expect to maintain separate insurance to cover intellectual property infringement 
our general liability insurance policy does not cover our infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
if infringement litigation against us is resolved unfavorably  we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling certain of our products or services without a license from a third party 
we may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
international patent protection is uncertain 
patent law outside the united states is uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
further  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our or our competitors foreign patents  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger with genesoft 
the success of our merger with genesoft will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating our business with the former business of genesoft 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends upon the successful integration of the former operations of genesoft 
the full integration of two independent companies  especially when one company is located on the west coast and the other on the east coast  is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies and realizing the expected benefits of the merger include  among others coordinating commercial and clinical development initiatives and staffs for factive and ramoplanin  raising sufficient capital to fund the significant expenditures that are needed to launch and successfully commercialize factive and the further clinical development of ramoplanin  retaining key employees  consolidating research and development operations  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and physical plant  
table of contents integrating and managing the technology of two companies  and minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns 
we cannot assure you that we will realize the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger 
in addition  we may not have sufficient capital to fully implement our strategies following the merger which may cause a delay in the launch of factive tablets and could further prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger 
our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a substantial level of debt 
as of december   after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the convertible notes during the second quarter of  we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding excluding trade payables and accrued liabilities 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt outstanding from time to time  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  impair our ability to incur additional debt because of financial and other restrictive covenants  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
if we experience a decline in revenues due to any of the factors described in this report or otherwise  we could have difficulty making required payments on our indebtedness 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any indebtedness we may incur in the future 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
risks related to our industry health care insurers and other payers may not pay for our products or may impose limits on reimbursement 
our ability to commercialize factive tablets  ramoplanin and our future products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for such products will be available from third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid  health maintenance organizations  health insurers and other public and private payers 
we cannot assure you that third party payers will pay for such products or will establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and private payers for use of our products  our products may fail to achieve market acceptance and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in december president bush signed into law new medicare prescription drug coverage legislation 

table of contents while we cannot yet predict the impact the new legislation could have on our ability to commercialize factive tablets  ramoplanin and any future products  the new legislation could adversely affect our anticipated revenues and results of operations  possibly materially 
many health maintenance organizations and other third party payers use formularies  or lists of drugs for which coverage is provided under a health care benefit plan  to control the costs of prescription drugs 
each payer that maintains a drug formulary makes its own determination as to whether a new drug will be added to the formulary and whether particular drugs in a therapeutic class will have preferred status over other drugs in the same class 
this determination often involves an assessment of the clinical appropriateness of the drug and sometimes the cost of the drug in comparison to alternative products 
we cannot assure you that factive tablets  ramoplanin or any of our future products will be added to payers formularies  whether our products will have preferred status to alternative therapies  nor whether the formulary decisions will be conducted in a timely manner 
we may also decide to enter into discount or formulary fee arrangements with payers  which could result in our receiving lower or discounted prices for factive tablets  ramoplanin or future products 
wholesalers  pharmacies and hospitals may not provide adequate distribution for our products 
our ability to commercialize factive tablets  ramoplanin and our future products  will depend  in part  on the extent to which we obtain adequate distribution of our products via wholesalers  pharmacies and hospital  as well as other customers 
wholesalers and larger retailers may be reluctant to stock and distribute oscient products since we are not a large  well established company 
if we do not obtain adequate distribution of our products  the commercial launch of factive and our anticipated revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards 
the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products  might expose us to product liability claims 
we currently maintain  and we expect that we will continue to maintain  product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
such insurance coverage might not protect us against all of the claims to which we might become subject 
we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a claim is brought against us  we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
furthermore  whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims  we might be required to direct financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity could result  all of which could harm our business 
in addition  a product recall or excessive warranty claims in any such case  whether arising from manufacturing deficiencies  labeling errors or other safety or regulatory reasons could have an adverse effect on our product sales or require a change in the indications for which our products may be used 
risks related to the securities market our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this section of the exhibit  as well as other factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize factive tablets  the revenues that we may derive from the sale of factive tablets  as compared to analyst estimates  the results of our clinical trials for ramoplanin and additional indications for factive and the pace of our progress in those clinical trials  
table of contents our ability to license or develop other compounds for clinical development  the timing of the achievement of our development milestones and other payments under our strategic alliance agreements  termination of  or an adverse development in  our strategic alliances  conditions and publicity regarding the biopharmaceutical industry generally  price and volume fluctuations in the stock market at large which do not relate to our operating performance  and comments by securities analysts  or our failure to meet market expectations 
over the two year period ending december  the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if litigation were instituted on this basis  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price if our securities  regardless of our operating performance 
multiple factors beyond our control may cause fluctuations in our operating results and may cause our business to suffer 
our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly  depending on a variety of factors  including the following the pace of our commercialization of factive tablets  the level of acceptance by physicians and third party payors of factive  the progress of our clinical trials for factive  ramoplanin and our other product candidates  our success in concluding deals to acquire additional approved products and product candidates  the introduction of new products and services by our competitors  regulatory actions  and expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
we will not be able to control many of these factors 
in addition  if our revenues in a particular period do not meet expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period  which could cause our business to suffer 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price may fall  possibly by a significant amount 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as specified in our investment policy guidelines  investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds with effective maturities of two years or less  and us government agency securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 

table of contents as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet 
in connection with the closing of the merger of genesoft  we assumed approximately million in genesoft debt  restructured at a annual interest rate  by issuing promissory notes of the company that are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the interest rates on our convertible notes payable are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
in the quarter ended june   we issued  in principal amount of our senior convertible promissory notes due april these notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holders at a conversion price of per share 
we may not redeem the notes at our election before may  after this date  we can redeem all or a part of the notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon the occurrence of a change of control or a termination of trading of our common stock each as defined in the indenture for the notes  holders of our notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  in the case of a cash purchase of our common stock  we may have an obligation to pay an additional make whole premium to our note holders based on a formula set forth in the indenture
