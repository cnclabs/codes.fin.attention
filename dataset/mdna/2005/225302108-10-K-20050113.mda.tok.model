item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and service engineering validation test equipment  diagnostics and failure analysis products and automatic test equipment  or ate  used for testing semiconductor integrated circuits  or ics 
we also develop  license and distribute software products that provide automation solutions in the ic design and test flow fields 
we serve a broad spectrum of the semiconductor industry s testing needs through a wide range of products that test digital logic  mixed signal  system on a chip  radio frequency  volatile and static and non volatile memory semiconductors 
we utilize our proprietary technologies to design products which are intended to provide a lower total cost of ownership than many competing products currently available while meeting the increasingly demanding performance requirements of today s engineering validation test  diagnostics and failure analysis and ate markets 
our hardware products are designed to test semiconductors at two stages of their lifecycle  first  at the prototype stage  and  second  as they are produced in high volume 
our software products enable design and test engineers to develop and troubleshoot production test programs prior to fabrication of the device prototype 
collectively  our customers include major semiconductor manufacturers  fabless design houses  foundries and assembly and test services companies 
major business developments during and subsequent to the fiscal year include in may  we acquired nptest  a company that designed  developed and manufactured advanced semiconductor test and diagnostic systems and provided related services for the semiconductor industry for a purchase price of approximately million 
the addition of nptest expands our base of customers and enables us to provide customers with a broader portfolio of solutions 
in connection with this acquisition  we paid to the former stockholders of nptest consideration comprised of cash in the aggregate amount of approximately million and the right to approximately million shares of our common stock  including the assumed conversion of  shares of preferred stock at a conversion ratio of to  with a fair value of approximately million 
we also assumed all of the outstanding nptest stock options with a fair value of approximately million 
we incurred direct costs associated with the acquisition of approximately million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction  and we have included in our results of operations  for the fiscal  the results of nptest beginning on may  see note  acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
customers requested shipment delays and we saw lower order activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to the first three quarters of we believe this may be the beginning of a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in november we announced a facilities restructuring plan that will close both of nptest s major north american facilities san jose and simi valley  california as well as a reduction in force 
our manufacturing operations in milpitas  california and simi valley  california will be moved to hillsboro  oregon 
this facilities restructuring plan is expected to occur primarily in the february to october time period 
approximately or employees  primarily in manufacturing  will be leaving the company as the result of this plan 
in connection with the facilities restructuring plan  we expect to record total charges of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in charges related to severance and related costs  approximately million in expenses for relocation and retention  approximately million in charges related to the write off or accelerated depreciation of tenant improvements  and approximately million in charges related to the write off of lease liabilities 
we expect to payout approximately million of the total charges associated with the facilities restructuring plan during fiscal we also expect to payout approximately million in fiscal through fiscal for lease liability payments 

table of contents a reduction in force affecting approximately positions or percent of our employees and contract workers occurred on november  we recorded a severance charge in the fourth fiscal quarter ended october  of approximately million for the reduction in force of the employees in connection to this event 
we added over employees across all functions as a result of the nptest acquisition 
these employees resulted in higher operating expenses compared to prior periods 
in addition  the acquisition resulted in million of intangible assets that will be amortized over one to ten years and million of deferred stock compensation that will be amortized over months 
in the third and fourth quarter of  we had special charges for cost of goods sold of million and million  respectively  related to inventory and liabilities as a result of a decision to discontinue significant future investments in redundant product lines stemming from the nptest acquisition 
in the third quarter ended july   we had restructuring charges of approximately million which consisted of million in equipment and non cancelable commitments related to our decision to discontinue significant future investments in redundant product lines  and approximately million in severance and related charges 
during fiscal  we enjoyed stronger sales across both our asl and kalos product lines 
we believe that most of the major ate industry participants were not consistently profitable for the years through  indicating a very competitive marketplace mired in a cyclical downturn of unprecedented length and depth 
our revenue remained relatively weak throughout fiscal and began to grow sequentially beginning in the second quarter of fiscal the test and assembly sector of the semiconductor equipment industry appeared to be recovering from the severe downturn that began in fiscal there were sequential improvements in the business environment in the first half of  however  based on customer requested shipping delays and lower order activity experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we believe there is current evidence that the industry again has slowed and there is uncertainty as to the strength and length of the current recession in the semiconductor capital equipment marketplace 
due to continued low visibility  until such time as we return to a period of sustainable profitability  we maintain a cautious outlook for future orders and sales levels 
our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  excess and obsolete inventory  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  our ability to effectively integrate acquisitions  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
in may  we completed our acquisition of nptest for a purchase price of approximately million consisting of stock  cash  assumption of nptest stock options  and direct acquisition costs 
our ability to effectively integrate nptest will affect our future sales  gross margins and operating results 
due to these and additional factors  historical results and percentage relationships discussed in this report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
for a further discussion of our business  and risk factors affecting our results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable factoring  bad debts  inventories  investments  leased equipment residual values  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
our revenue recognition policies are applied consistently among our semiconductor manufacturing equipment product lines 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment when the product is classified as mature and the customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
revenue related to the fair value of the installation obligation is recognized upon completion of the installation 
service revenues are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customer 
products are classified as mature after several different customers have accepted similar systems 
for sales of new products or when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
for some customers in certain countries where collection may be an issue  we often require a letter of credit to be established before products are shipped 
lease revenue is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for leases  which requires that a lessor account for each lease by either the direct financing  sales type or operating method 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the net present value of future lease payments 
revenue from operating leases is recognized over the lease period 
under the sab revenue recognition policy  we defer revenue for transactions that involve newly introduced products or when customers specify acceptance criteria that cannot be demonstrated prior to the shipment 
during fiscal through  we introduced several new systems and products 
certain revenues from sales of these new systems and products during fiscal through have been deferred until the revenue recognition requirements of our revenue recognition policy are satisfied 
this practice will continue in the future with new products 
in the past  we experienced significant delays in the introduction and acceptance of new testers as well as certain enhancements to our existing testers 
as a result  some customers have experienced significant delays in receiving and accepting our testers in production 
delays in introducing a product or delays in our ability to obtain customer acceptance  if they occur in the future  will delay the recognition of revenue and related gross profit by us 
when we are able to separate multiple deliverables from one another  we recognize revenue for each deliverable  based on each deliverable s fair value  when the revenue recognition criteria for that specific deliverable is achieved 
in the vast majority of cases  our orders are shipped complete 
in rare instances when 
table of contents there are multiple shipments due to materials shortages  revenue and related cost of sales are recognized only for the items that are physically shipped 
if the items not shipped on an order are required for the functionality of the delivered items  revenue and related cost of sales are deferred on the delivered items and recognized only upon the shipment of the required items 
if there are specific customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the specified performance has been completed in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
installation in the majority of the cases occurs within two weeks of shipment 
installation is considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory 
the cost of installation can be reliably estimated and is accrued at shipment 
in order to comply with emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue related to the total value of installations not completed at the end of the period was deferred 
sales in the united states and europe are principally through our direct sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and representatives 
sales in asia and regions outside the united states and europe utilize both direct sales employees and distributors 
there are no significant differences in our revenue recognition policies based on the sales channel  due to the business practices that we have adopted with our distributor relationships 
because of these business circumstances we do not use price protection  stock rotation  or similar programs with our distributors 
we do not typically sell inventory into our distributors for eventual sale to end users  but rather we sell product to the distributors on the basis of a purchase order received from an end user 
we evaluate any revenue recognition issues with respect to the end customer in light of our revenue recognition policy and in accordance with sab we sell stand alone software products and the revenue recognition policies related to these sales fall within the scope of aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition 
the stand alone software products are applications for integrated circuit  or ic  manufacturers and test and assembly contractors to help improve quality and shorten development lead times 
we also have embedded software in our semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
we believe this embedded software is incidental to our products and therefore is excluded from the scope of sop since the embedded software in our products is not sold separately  cannot be used on another vendor s products  and we cannot fundamentally enhance or expand the capability of the equipment with new or revised software 
in addition  the equipment s principal performance characteristics are governed by digital speed and pin count which are primarily a function of the hardware 
accounts receivable factoring during fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to sell certain of our trade receivables in non recourse transactions 
these receivables were not included in our consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year of as the criteria for sale treatment established by sfas no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  had been met 
under sfas  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity derecognizes financial assets when the control has been surrendered 
we believe our factoring agreement meets the criteria of a true sale of these assets since the acquiring party retains the title to these receivables and has assumed the risk that the receivables will be collectible 
the trade receivables were sold at a discount plus administrative and other fees 
the discount amount  administrative and other fees are accounted for in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the proceeds received are included as cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts in conjunction with our sales and distribution partners  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record our bad debt expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  for example because of bankruptcy or deteriorations in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s 
table of contents outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivable balances 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers or changes in general economic conditions  and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
inventory valuation and residual values related to leased products we evaluate our inventory levels and valuations based on our estimates and forecasts of the next cyclical period in our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to sell current and future products in the next cyclical industry period and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to adjust our assessment of the inventory valuations 
once inventories are written off  we carry that inventory at its reduced value until it is scrapped or otherwise disposed of 
in fiscal  we recorded special charges to cost of goods sold of million of which million was directly related to inventory write downs 
these write downs were related to the acquisition of nptest which resulted in duplicate product lines 
we evaluated the redundant product lines using internal and external marketing data  the development roadmap for each product line  existing and potential customers and demand for the product 
as a result of the evaluation  we identified production inventory  finished goods and consignment and demonstration inventory in excess of estimated future customer demand of approximately million  write downs to estimated current market value of approximately million  purchase commitments of approximately million  field service spares of approximately million and other assets and expenses of approximately million 
due to the dramatic decline in the semiconductor business cycle and corresponding impact on revenue in the period through and continued uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of the recovery in semiconductor equipment sales  we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of the cyclical period ahead 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges to cost of goods sold of million due to a legal settlement on cancelled purchase contracts with an inventory vendor and million due to spare part write offs related to our valstar product line 
in addition  over the past three years we have recorded a total of million in charges for the write offs of excess and obsolete inventories 
we do not as a matter of course scrap all inventory that is identified as excess or obsolete 
our products are capital goods with potentially long economic lives and historically the opportunity to sell these products has arisen unexpectedly 
we have occasionally encountered unexpected demand for old products as well as inability to transition customers to newer products 
we closely monitor the inventories that have been written down but not scrapped  so that if any sales of these items occur and affect our reported gross margins  the effect  if material is disclosed 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory if a downturn causes further reductions to our current inventory valuations or our current product development plans change 
we consign a portion of our finished goods inventory to both external and internal customers on a short term basis primarily for the purpose of customer demonstration 
this inventory is categorized as finished goods inventory on the balance sheet 
we depreciate all consigned inventories during the period that they are held on consignment over months 
the depreciation expense for consigned inventory is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
residual values assigned to our products that are leased to customers are based on their remaining economic life at the end of the lease terms 
the amounts assigned to the residual values are evaluated periodically based on technological change and the forecasted business cycle 

table of contents long lived asset valuation our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and identified intangible assets 
effective november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which was issued by the fasb in july under this standard  we ceased amortizing goodwill and acquired workforce effective november  in fiscal  goodwill also increased by approximately million due to our acquisition of nptest holding corporation see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies and note acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to our market value falling below our net book value for a significant period of time  a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a significant change in direction with respect to investment in a product or market segment  the likelihood that a significant portion of the business will be sold or disposed of  or the results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit determined in accordance with sfas the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of the future performance of the company 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value reflect the company s best estimates 
as mandated by sfas  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of july  and determined that no potential impairment existed as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we recognized no impairment loss in fiscal however  no assurances can be given that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in future impairment charges 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and at such other times as events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future discounted cash flow 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of the future performance of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is attributed 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units  including discount rate used and estimated terminal value reflect our best estimates 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of identifiable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  or at least annually  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the 
table of contents fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
we made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of an acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer relations  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements and they typically have estimated useful lives of one to ten years 
warranty accrual we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services with a fixed fee 
the fixed fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 
deferred taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to calculate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of october  was zero reflecting a full valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
restructuring and special charges over the past years  we have recorded restructuring charges as we rationalized operations in light of customer demand declines and the economic downturn 
these measures  which included reducing the workforce  consolidating facilities and changing the strategic focus of a number of sites  were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand and to transition our operations to lower cost regions 
the restructuring charges include employee severance and benefit costs  and costs related to leased facilities vacated and subleased 
severance and benefit costs and other costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to october  were recorded in compliance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
severance and benefit costs associated with restructuring activities initiated in or after october are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  employer s accounting for postemployment benefits  as the company concluded that a it had a substantive postemployment benefit obligation that is attributed to prior services rendered  b rights to those benefits vested  and c payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed restructuring plan 

table of contents during fiscal year  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million of which  million related to the severance and related charges relating to the termination of employees 
in addition  we recorded million related to write off of equipment and liabilities incurred related to the decision to discontinue significant future investments in redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
as a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters to our owned facilities in milpitas  california and the vacating of previously leased buildings in fremont  california  we recorded million to write off the remaining lease payments for this lease  net of expected sublease income 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded cost of sales special charges of million 
of this amount  million was related to vendors liabilities  spare part write downs  long lived assets write off  the scrapping of existing work orders  and workforce reduction 
the remaining balance related to inventory write downs as discussed above 
during fiscal year  we recorded cost of sales special charges of million due to a million settlement reached with an inventory supplier relating to cancelled purchase orders and million for spare part write downs associated with the valstar product line 
during the fiscal year  we recorded a million special charge related to inventories based on information gathered during the company s annual strategic plan regarding the continued negative effect of the semiconductor industry recession 
the write down of inventories affected three categories of exposures million for the rfx product line as management made estimates for the end of life of this product 
million for the sc product line as management made estimates for the end of life of this product 
million related to other product inventory on hand as well as future vendor commitments in excess of estimated future customer demand 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of original estimates 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives and other special charges 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring and other plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions

net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from systems sales  upgrades  spare parts sales  maintenance contracts  lease and rental income and software sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these improvements in net sales were due primarily to a general upturn in the industry and to our purchase of nptest in the third quarter of fiscal for the fiscal years ended october  and  revenue from our digital and mixed signal products was million and million  respectively 
revenue from our memory products increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal in addition  our service revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the acquisition of nptest brought an additional million of digital and mixed signal revenues  million of diagnostic system revenues  and million of service revenues 
sustainability of these revenue levels is dependent upon the economic and geopolitical climate  as well as other risks described under the heading risk factors herein 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  international net sales for nptest represented of nptest s product and services net sales 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that may materially adversely affect the demand for our products 
capital markets in asia historically have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
in addition  the economic impact of geopolitical instabilities on the korean peninsula as well as health risks such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome in the asian region may affect future orders from this region and the timing of or payment for shipments made to this region 

table of contents our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of digital mixed signal memory service diagnostic systems software and other total revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than and of our net sales in each respective period 
operating lease and rental revenues were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  sell through of previously written off inventory  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  special charges  and field service margins 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in fiscal gross margins from fiscal levels primarily reflects the benefits of a higher operating efficiencies and other factors described below  offset by the effect of special charges in fiscal cost of sales of million related to excess and obsolete inventory and other charges due to our decision to discontinue significant future investment in our redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
in fiscal the special charges to cost of goods sold consisted of million for a legal settlement with an inventory supplier and million in spare part write offs in our valstar product line 
excluding the effect of these special charges  the gross margin as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to better manufacturing efficiencies stemming from higher production volumes as well as better product mix of newer products with higher gross margins 
in addition  during fiscal year  our gross margin benefited by approximately from the sale of fully reserved inventory and the sale of kalos asic devices previously written down in a lower of cost or market provision 
excluding the effect of the special charges  we believe gross margins could be lower for at least the next several quarters primarily due to a mix of lower gross margin products as well as manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from lower business levels 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses were million in the fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in spending during fiscal resulted primarily from the acquisition of nptest  resulted in an additional million of expenses 
excluding nptest  r d expense decreased for the fiscal year primarily due to the reduction in our headcount of people in the third quarter of fiscal  of which were in r d 
in addition  there are several products  including asl and kalos  that have been released to manufacturing  resulting in lower non recurring engineering nre expenses associated with the development of those products 
these savings were partially offset by the ongoing investment in new products and r d expenses associated with the products obtained in the acquisition of nptest 
r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the higher sales levels during as compared to fiscal we will continue to invest significant resources in the development and completion of new products and product enhancements 
accordingly  we anticipate that r d expenses will remain above the million annual level in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of nptest  which resulted in an additional million of expenses 

table of contents for the year ended october   there was an increase in variable compensation and commissions of million related to our overall increase in net sales and profitability 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of expenses for costs associated with the integration of nptest which primarily included acquisition consulting fees related to workforce and product line decisions 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we accelerated the remaining depreciation for leasehold improvements and property and equipment of million related to buildings located in fremont that we vacated when we moved to our new headquarters in milpitas 
these accelerated depreciation charges ended in the first quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the higher sales levels during as compared to fiscal we expect sg a expenses for fiscal to be flat in absolute dollars when compared to those recorded in fiscal amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was higher in fiscal due primarily to the acquisition of nptest in may remaining estimated annual amortization expense for purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation is expected to be million  million  and million  for the fiscal years ending in through  respectively 
as of november  we adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of july  and determined that no potential impairment existed as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we recognized no impairment loss in fiscal in connection with sfas in process research and development 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of nptest 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million in for the write off of in process research and development resulting from the purchase of optonics 
the charges were recorded as an operating expense 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal year  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million 
of the million  million related to severance and related charges associated with the termination of employees 
in addition  we recorded million related to the write off of equipment and non cancelable commitments incurred related to a decision to discontinue significant future investments in redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
as a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters to our owned facilities in milpitas  california and the vacating of our previously leased buildings in fremont  california  we recorded million to write off the remaining lease payments for this lease  net of expected sublease income of the austin  texas facility 
during the fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million as operating expenses related to headcount reductions 
the reduction in force included the elimination of approximately positions of the company s worldwide employee base 
see note special charges and restructuring  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower investment balances in fiscal interest expense 
interest expenses were million and million for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increased of million 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june other income and expenses  net 
other income and expenses were million of income and million of expenses for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increase of million 
the increase in 
table of contents other income and expenses  net  in fiscal primarily was due to the mark down to fair value of an acquired liability owed to the former parent of nptest 
the decline in the liability during the year was million as the liability declined from million at the may  acquisition date to million at october  the current value of the liability is based on our stock price as of october  see note acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for description of the acquired contingent liability

we recorded an income tax provision of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the income tax expense in consisted of us current income tax benefits of million and foreign tax on earnings and foreign withholding taxes of million generated from our foreign operations  primarily germany 
the current us income tax benefit consists of million attributable to the settlement of an irs audit  million related to domestic tax contingency reserves and net operating loss carryback for nptest of million 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal for fiscal and  the effective tax rate was greater than the expected federal statutory tax benefit rate of primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
at october   we had unused net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in through utilization of the our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain reversals of temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to uncertainties in the timing and amount of such realization of our deferred tax assets  we have provided a valuation allowance equal to its net deferred assets at october  and october  we expect to record a full valuation allowance on domestic tax benefits until we can sustain a consistent level of profitability 
until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our results of operations 
vs 
net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from systems sales  upgrades  spare parts sales  maintenance contracts  lease and rental income and software sales 
net sales increased  primarily due to the million in net sales derived from the products obtained in our acquisitions of optonics and sz  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in and early our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of digital mixed signal memory service emission based optical probers software  leases and other total 
table of contents revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each respective period 
operating lease and rental revenues were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  sell through of previously written off inventory  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  special charges  and field service margins 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the million increase in fiscal gross margins from fiscal levels primarily reflects the effect of special charges in fiscal cost of sales related to a million legal settlement with an inventory supplier and million spare part write offs in our valstar product line compared to million of write offs of excess inventories in fiscal see note special charges and restructuring  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the excess inventory write offs were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor equipment industries that began in fiscal and continued through fiscal during fiscal year  there were no gross margin benefits from the sale of fully reserved inventory 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting restructuring actions affecting r d taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal and first and third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in r d 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company reduced the headcount by a further persons most of which were in sg a functions and a small number in r d 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company reduced the head count by a further persons  of which approximately were in r d functions 
these headcount reductions reduced our r d expenses by approximately million 
in addition  during fiscal the completion of the evaluation periods for several new products introduced during fiscal including the octet and asl resulted in less non recurring engineering nre expenses associated with the development of those products 
these savings were partially offset by the ongoing investment in new products and r d expenses associated with the products obtained in the acquisitions of optonics and sz in early fiscal the sz and optonics acquisitions added a total of approximately employees to the company  of which about percent perform r d 
the r d expenses associated with the acquired products represented approximately million of the r d expenses in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the slightly higher sg a spending in fiscal was primarily due to added sg a expenses of approximately million from the optonics and sz acquisitions and accelerated depreciation of million for leasehold improvements and property and equipment related to buildings we planned on vacating in the first quarter of fiscal when we moved to our new headquarters  offset by decreases in payroll related expenses resulting from a lower headcount and ongoing operating expense management 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in sg a functions 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company reduced the headcount by a further persons most of which were in sg a functions and a small number in r d 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company reduced the head count by a further persons  of which approximately were in sg a functions 
the sz and optonics acquisitions added a total of approximately employees to the company 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  reflecting the increase in business levels 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
this decline was primarily the result of adopting sfas goodwill and other intangible assets as of 
table of contents november  the adoption of sfas reduced the annual amortization expense by approximately million 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are reviewed annually or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
in process research and development 
we recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal for the write off of in process research and development resulting from the purchase of optonics 
see note acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the optonics purchase price allocation 
the charge was recorded as an operating expense 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million as operating expenses related to headcount reductions 
the reduction in force included the elimination of approximately positions of the company s worldwide employee base 
in fiscal  we recorded charges of approximately million  consisting of million  million  and million for severance charges  asset disposals  and lease write offs  respectively  which were included in operating expenses 
these charges were associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations we implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in manufacturing  were in r d and about were in sg a functions 
as part of this reduction we discontinued our next generation dram ims product and closed the associated ims facilities in switzerland and germany 
we exited the ims facility in beaverton  oregon and consolidated these employees into our facility in hillsboro  oregon 
see note special charges and restructuring  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we wrote off approximately million of notes receivable in the fourth fiscal quarter of these impairment charges were due to the decline in the fair value of the notes receivable and were judged to be other than temporary 
the write offs of these individual notes receivable consisted of a million promissory note issued by credence capital corporation  or ccc  then owned  controlled and managed by the garrett capital group  an unaffiliated party  and a million promissory note from a customer issued in april as the result of a settlement on outstanding receivables 
the timing of these write offs was largely driven by the continuation of the downturn experienced by the semiconductor equipment industry during in the case of ccc  formerly a non affiliated company that provided lease  structured financing and other financing alternatives to our customers  its continued financial weakness ultimately resulted in our decision to pursue control of ccc 
this acquisition occurred in february in the case of the customer s promissory note  the customer s principal venture capital investor threatened to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and we wrote off this note as part of a restructured settlement on existing equipment leases 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge totaling million associated with the impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of dci in january the charge consisted of million for the remaining intangible assets related to customer lists and million for remaining goodwill 
this impairment was based on the planned sale of the subsidiary to its management team effective november  dci had been integrated into our memory products line at the height of the last business cycle in january the economic advantage of maintaining the capabilities of dci diminished as the operating results deteriorated dramatically with the onset of this downturn 
in addition  it became evident that it was unlikely the memory products business volume would increase to a level where the operational advantages of dci would be fully realized 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal as well as a declining investment balance throughout the fiscal years until june when we completed our convertible subordinated notes offering 
see note convertible subordinated notes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expenses were million and million for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increased of million 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to million of interest related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june  and of other interest 
other income and expenses  net 
other expenses were million and million for fiscal year and  a decreased from million in fiscal the expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to million of loan origination expenses related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june  million in net losses on sales of property and equipment  offset by a million gain on the sale of a publicly traded equity security held as an available for sale investment 
in  we incurred a million write down of a publicly traded equity security held as an available for sale investment due to the decline in the fair value of this investment that was judged to be other than temporary 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the income tax expense in consists of foreign tax on earnings and foreign withholding taxes generated from our foreign operations 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on domestic tax benefits until we can reliably forecast future profitability 
until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our results of operations 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal for fiscal and  the effective tax rate was greater than the expected federal statutory tax benefit rate of primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities during fiscal was million 
the net cash flows used by operating activities for fiscal were primarily net income before depreciation and amortization  non cash charges  inventory write downs and in process research and development of million offset by million in additional working capital requirements 
cash used for working capital included million for inventory and million for accounts receivable 
increases in accounts receivable were primarily associated with increased business volumes in fiscal when compared to increases in inventories partially resulted from purchases of inventory to meet anticipated fourth quarter sales volumes that failed to materialize as the industry moved into a down cycle  and partially from business volume increases over investing activities provided net cash of approximately million in fiscal resulting primarily from net sales of available for sale securities of million  offset by million of net cash acquired and used to purchase nptest and million of cash used for the new milpitas headquarters  a facility in germany and other property  plant and equipment to support our business 
financing activities provided net cash flows of million in fiscal the cash in fiscal was primarily provided by million received from the issuance of common stock relating to our employee equity plans which were offset in part by payments of bank loans and notes payable related to leased products of million 
as of october   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  and accounts receivable and inventories totaling million 
we believe that  because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our products and the new products we presently plan to introduce  investments in inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of our working capital 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the ate industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is possible that events related to these factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
see discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 

table of contents we believe our current cash and investment positions combined with the ability to borrow funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated business requirements for the next months and the foreseeable future  including cash required for potential acquisitions or strategic investments  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
in may  we acquired nptest for a total cash payment to the former stockholders of nptest of approximately million and the right to approximately million shares of our common stock  including the assumed conversion of  shares of preferred stock at a conversion ratio of to  with a fair value of approximately million 
we also incurred direct costs associated with the acquisition of approximately million 
see note acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as a result of the nptest acquisition  we may be required to make a payment to schlumberger limited schlumberger  the former parent of nptest  at a date in the future pursuant to a provision in the acquisition agreement between nptest and schlumberger under which nptest was acquired by francisco partners  lp from schlumberger 
the future payment date may be triggered by various events  including certain distributions by nptest holding  llc an entity controlled by francisco partners  lp to its members  or  at schlumberger s option  it can be triggered on may  the payment amount is contingent upon the value of our common stock at the time of distribution 
as of october   this obligation was approximately million or approximately million shares based on the closing stock price of per share 
if payment is triggered at schlumberger s option  we generally may settle this payment in cash or stock 
if payment is triggered by a distribution by nptest holding  llc to its members  the payment to schlumberger is required to be in the same form as the distribution to the members and thus may be made in cash  stock or both 
if the obligations were to be settled with common stock  we estimated the maximum number of shares to be issued would be approximately million shares 
we may engage in discussions with schlumberger with regard to this payment  which discussions may include acceleration of the payment and the payment of the obligation in the form of cash or stock 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to sell our trade receivables in non recourse transactions 
we can sell up to million of our trade receivables at any time 
we continue to service the collection aspect of the trade receivables sold 
the trade receivables are sold at a discount plus administrative and other fees 
the discount amount  the administrative and other fees are accounted for as other income and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
for fiscal  discount  administrative and other fees were approximately million 
sales of trade receivables are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the proceeds received are included as cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
during the fiscal  we sold approximately million in gross trade receivables 
at october  approximately million of this factoring line was not utilized and thus available to the company 
we lease our facilities and equipment under operating leases that expire periodically through of which approximately million and million have been written off to special operating charges in fiscal year and  respectively 
the approximate future minimum lease payments at october  are as follows in thousands committed gross lease payments leases written off in restructuring charges net estimated future lease expense thereafter this is net of estimated sublease income

this is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as bank loans and notes payable leased products 
this is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as convertible subordinated notes 
some of the components that we purchase are unique to us and must be purchased in relatively high minimum quantities with long four and five month lead times 
these business circumstances can lead to us holding relatively high inventory levels and associated risks 
in addition  purchase commitments for unique components are relatively inflexible in terms of deferral or cancellation 
at october   we had open and committed non cancelable purchase orders totaling approximately million 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at october  under these arrangements and others 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these arrangements provide for potential cancellation charges 
net transfers of inventory to property and equipment were million in fiscal mature product spare parts that are used in our service business are classified in other long term assets 
in addition  we capitalize a small number of finished systems into the manufacturing function for use in de bug  quality control  and software development as well as the sales function for use in demonstrations and application development 
when capitalized finished goods are sold to third parties the transaction is recorded as a sale of a fixed asset 
as of october   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  no material commitments for capital expenditures and did not have any special purpose entities 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 

table of contents we believe our current cash and investment positions will be sufficient to meet our anticipated business requirements for the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under that interpretation  certain entities known as variable interest entities vies must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is generally defined as having the majority of the risks or rewards arising from the vie 
for vies in which a significant but not majority variable interest is held  certain disclosures are required 
we have not entered into any arrangements or made any investments which qualify as a vie after january  and therefore the initial implementation of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
for vies acquired before february   fin required us to apply the accounting and disclosure rules in the first quarter of fiscal this requirement was superseded by issuance of a revision to interpretation no 
 as noted below 
in december  the fasb issued revision to interpretation no 
fin r which replaced fin the revised interpretation further refines the definition of vies and provides guidelines on identifying them and assessing an enterprise s interests in a vie to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin r applies at different dates to different types of enterprises and entities  and special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied fin prior to issuance of fin r 
generally  application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in vies or potential vies commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin r did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the principal revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab  which was effective upon issuance 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the eitf task force reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired and the disclosure requirements relating to those impairments 
eitf is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of eitf did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon the occurrence of a market price condition be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf will become effective in the period when the proposed amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  becomes effective 
the adoption of eitf will not materially impact the company s diluted earnings per share 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs  or sfas sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material  and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our financial positions or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas the statement requires that the costing resulting from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement requires companies to use the fair value based payment measurement method in accounting for share based payment with employees as well as for goods and services received from non employee 
sfas r is effective for all awards granted after the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the adoption of this statement is expected to have a material impact on our financial positions or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  medium term notes  asset backed securities  us treasury notes and obligations of us government agencies  bank certificates of deposit  auction rate preferred securities  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except percent amounts 
future maturities of investments held at october  balance october  balance october  thereafter cash equivalents amounts average rate short term investments amounts average rate long term investments amounts average rate total investment average rate equity instruments we mitigate default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
the sensitivity analysis model used by us for interest rate exposure compares interest income on current investment interest rates versus current investment levels at current interest rates with a increase 
based on this model  a increase or decrease would result in an increase or a decrease in interest income of approximately  there can be no assurances that the above projected interest rate increase will materialize 
fluctuations of interest rates are beyond our control 

table of contents foreign exchange we generate a significant portion of our sales from customers located outside the united states  principally in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
international sales are made mostly to foreign distributors and some foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in us dollars  but occasionally are denominated in the local currency for european and japanese customers 
the subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
our sz product line is developed and manufactured in germany and thus those expenses are euro based 
accordingly  some of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
foreign currency losses were approximately  and  for the fiscal year ended october  and  respectively 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company does not currently use derivatives  but will continue to assess the need for these instruments in the future 
interest rate risk the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of  and therefore changes in interest rates do not impact the company s interest expense on this debt 
the company from time to time has outstanding short term borrowings with variable interest rates 
the total average amount of these borrowings outstanding annually has been insignificant 
therefore  the company expects that a change in interest rate will not have any material effect on the company s interest expense
