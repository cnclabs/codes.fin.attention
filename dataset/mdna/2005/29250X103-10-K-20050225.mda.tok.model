critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to herein as us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
any effects on the consolidated financial statements resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
accounting for investment in enbridge energy partners  lp we use the equity method of accounting for our ownership interest in the partnership s net income and comprehensive income because we exercise significant influence over the partnership 
we record our share of earnings of the partnership in the period in which it is earned 
as of december  and  we owned approximately and of the partnership  respectively 
our ownership percentage changes as i units are distributed and class a common units are issued by the partnership 
changes in the calculation of the ownership percentage affect our net income and comprehensive income 
gain on issuance of units by enbridge energy partners  lp we recognize a gain or loss when our ownership interest in the partnership is diluted 
this occurs when the partnership issues additional class a common units and we do not participate in the issuance 
to the extent the new issuance price per unit is greater than or less than our average cost per unit  a gain loss is recognized 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations our results of operations consist of our share of earnings of the partnership attributable to the i units we own 
at december   and  through our ownership of i units  we have an approximate  and limited partner interest in the partnership  respectively 
our percentage ownership in the partnership will change over time as the number of i units we own becomes a different percentage of the total units outstanding due to our ownership of additional i units and other issuances of additional common units by the partnership 
for the years ended december   and  the partnership reported net income of million  million and million  respectively 
our net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  represents equity in earnings attributable to the i units that we own  plus the dilution gain from the partnership s issuance of units  reduced by deferred income tax expense 
deferred income tax expense is calculated based on the difference between the accounting and tax values of our investment in the partnership and the federal income tax rate of of our share of the earnings of the partnership 
our earnings were lower in over by million primarily due to the partnership having issued fewer common units in as compared to  resulting in a decrease in dilution gains to million in from million in our net income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net earnings in was primarily due to a full year of equity earnings as opposed to the two and one half months of equity earnings in  as well as dilution gains of million recognized in both basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing our net income by our weighted average number of outstanding shares during the period 
earnings per share for was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in earnings per share is attributable to lower net income and slightly higher weighted average shares outstanding 
there are no securities outstanding that may be converted into or exercised for shares 
liquidity and capital resources our authorized capital structure consists of two classes of membership interests our listed shares  which represent limited liability company interests with limited voting rights  and our voting shares 
at december   our issued capitalization consisted of million associated with our  outstanding listed shares 
at december   our issued capitalization consisted of million associated with our  outstanding listed shares 
the number of our shares outstanding  including the voting shares owned by the general partner  will at all times equal the number of i units we own in the partnership 
we used substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to purchase i units from the partnership and to compensate enbridge the ultimate parent company of the general partner for its purchase provisions and tax indemnities 
under the enbridge purchase provisions  which are a part of our limited liability company agreement  enbridge has the right  under limited circumstances  to purchase our outstanding shares 
in addition  enbridge generally agreed to indemnify us for any tax liability attributable to our formation  our management of the partnership or our ownership of the i units 
as well  enbridge generally agreed to indemnify us for any taxes arising from a transaction involving the i units to the extent the transaction does not generate sufficient cash to pay such taxes  in each case  other than any texas franchise taxes or any other foreign  state or local taxes that are required to be paid or reimbursed by the partnership under the delegation of control agreement 
the number of our shares outstanding  including the voting shares owned by the general partner  will at all times equal the number of i units in the partnership that we own 
typically  the general partner and owners of the partnership s common units receive distributions from the partnership in cash 
instead of receiving cash distributions  however  the number of i units we own increases automatically under the partnership s partnership agreement 
the amount of this increase is calculated by dividing the distribution per unit by the closing price of one of our listed shares on the nyse as determined for a trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the ex dividend date for our listed shares 
at the same time that the number of i units we own increases  we will make a distribution on our shares in the form of additional shares  with the result that the number of shares that are then outstanding will equal the number of i units that we own 
if we incur liabilities or other obligations in connection with the performance of our obligations under the delegation of control agreement  we are entitled to be reimbursed or to be indemnified by the partnership or the general partner 
thus  we expect that our expenditures associated with managing the business and affairs of the partnership and the reimbursement of these expenses that we receive will continue to be equal 
as stated above  we do not receive quarterly distributions of cash on the i units we hold 
therefore  we expect neither to generate nor to require significant amounts of cash in ongoing operations 
any net cash proceeds we receive from the sale of additional shares will immediately be used to purchase additional i units 
accordingly  we do not anticipate any other sources of or needs for additional liquidity 
we are not permitted to borrow money or incur debt other than with enbridge and its affiliates without the approval of holders owning at least a majority of our shares 
income taxes we are a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations for the period in which such changes are effective 
currently  our only temporary difference and associated deferred tax expense results from recording our equity in the earnings of the partnership 
the effective tax rate used in computing our income tax provision is  which represents the federal statutory rate 
we are a party to a tax indemnification agreement with enbridge 
pursuant to this tax indemnification agreement  enbridge agreed to indemnify us from any tax liability attributable to our formation or our management of the business and affairs of the partnership 
enbridge also agreed to indemnify us from any taxes arising out of a transaction involving the i units we own to the extent the transaction does not generate sufficient cash to pay our taxes with respect to such transaction in each case  other than any texas franchise taxes or any other foreign  state or local taxes that are required to be paid or reimbursed by the partnership under the delegation of control agreement
