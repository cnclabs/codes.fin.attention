the following will be discussed and analyzed overview of business overview of results results of operations and related information liquidity and capital resources variable interest entities critical accounting policies and use of estimates contingencies and legal matters new accounting standards business outlook information concerning forward looking statements overview of business the corporation is a global health and hygiene company with manufacturing facilities in countries and its products are sold in more than countries 
the corporation s products are sold under such well known brands as kleenex  scott  huggies  pull ups  kotex and depend 
the corporation has three reportable global business segments personal care  consumer tissue and business to business 
these global business segments are described in greater detail in item of this form k and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in managing this global business  the corporation s management believes that developing new and improved products  responding effectively to competitive challenges  obtaining and maintaining leading market shares  controlling costs  and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the corporation 
the discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors 
product innovation past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation 
the corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and or maintain category leadership 
in order to develop new or improved products  the technology to support those products must be developed 
research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care  tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials 
competitive environment past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets  both domestically and internationally 
our products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which are typically sold at lower prices 
we have several major competitors in most of our markets  some of which are larger and more diversified 
the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty  product innovation  quality and performance  price  and marketing and distribution capabilities 

table of contents part ii continued aggressive competitive actions in and have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the corporation s products in the market 
we expect competition to continue to be intense in market shares achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance 
we hold the number or brand position in more than countries 
achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands 
cost controls to maintain our competitive position  we must control our manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
we have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of our business segments 
our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of oil  pulp and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes 
our strategic investments in information systems should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities 
foreign currency and commodity risks as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we are also exposed to commodity prices 
our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations 
on november   the corporation distributed to its stockholders all of the shares of common stock of neenah paper  inc neenah paper  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in april to facilitate the spin off of the us fine and technical papers businesses and the canadian pulp mills the spin off 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  prior period consolidated income statements and cash flow statements and related disclosures present the results of neenah paper s fine paper and technical paper businesses  which were previously included in the business to business segment  as discontinued operations 
prior to the spin off  the corporation internally consumed approximately percent of the pulp produced by the canadian pulp business 
in connection with the spin off  the corporation entered into a long term pulp supply agreement to purchase a substantial portion of the pulp produced by neenah paper 
because we will continue to incur pulp costs in our operations  the results of neenah paper s canadian pulp business have not been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas the following discussion and analysis is based on a comparison of the corporation s continuing operations 
overview of results during  the corporation continued to face intense competition in most of its markets 
in particular  the diaper and pants categories in north america and europe continued to be affected by the competitive pricing pressures that began in late the tissue businesses were also adversely affected by higher fiber costs  and all of the businesses faced higher materials input costs 
despite these challenges  improved results were achieved in net sales grew percent 
net sales advanced in each of the three business segments and in each geographic region 
innovative and improved products such as huggies convertibles diaper pants  huggies diapers with triple leak protection  pull ups training pants with easy open sides  gender specific goodnites youth pants  anti viral kleenex tissue  scott coreless jumbo bathroom tissue and kotex lightdays everyday pantiliners contributed to increased sales volumes 

table of contents part ii continued operating profit increased percent and income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased percent and percent  respectively 
increased sales volumes more than offset the effect of lower net selling prices 
cost savings of nearly million helped to temper the effects of higher costs for fiber  other materials  energy and distribution of over million 
cash flow from operations in set a record for the fourth consecutive year 
the corporation repurchased million shares of its common stock for about billion 
annual cash dividends were increased by percent in and will increase another percent in market shares us market shares are tracked on a sales dollar basis with information provided by ac nielsen for distribution through the food  drug and mass merchandising channels  excluding wal mart  warehouse clubs  dollar stores and certain other outlets 
these customers do not report market share information publicly

per share in and million  
per share in the effects of these tax credits are shown separately in the corporation s reconciliation of the us statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in note to the consolidated financial statements

kcm s operating profit benefited from higher sales volumes of about percent and cost savings programs 
however  these positive factors could not overcome higher fiber and other materials costs and negative currency effects 

table of contents part ii continued minority owners share of subsidiaries net income decreased percent primarily due to kimberly clark australia pty

in  the corporation contributed million to its pension plan trusts compared with million in the significant level of cash provided by operations in allowed the corporation to make a contribution of million to its us defined benefit pension plan in december  which had originally been planned for while the corporation is not required to make a contribution in to the us plan  the benefit of an additional contribution will be evaluated 
about million will be contributed to plans outside the us in contractual obligations the following table presents the corporation s total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable 
total millions of dollars contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations open purchase orders total contractual obligations   
table of contents part ii continued obligations commentary the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials  primarily pulp including the new long term pulp agreement with neenah paper  and utilities  principally electricity 
although the corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  management believes the corporation s exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services it has negotiated for delivery 
the above table does not include future payments that the corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
based upon those projections  the corporation anticipates making payments for these obligations within a range from approximately million in to more than million by the table also does not include anticipated payments related to the synthetic fuel partnerships 
such payments will only be made if the partnerships produce synthetic fuel in future years 
the corporation estimates that it will make payments to these partnerships of approximately million in  and  and will receive income tax benefits and credits in excess of these amounts 
deferred taxes  minority interest and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table 
a consolidated financing subsidiary has issued preferred securities that are in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary in november and each year anniversary thereafter 
management currently anticipates that these securities will not be called in november  the next call date  and therefore they are not included in the above table see financing commentary below and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these securities 
investing commentary during  the corporation s capital spending of million  which is equal to percent of net sales  was below the long term targeted range of percent to percent of net sales 
the lower level of spending in resulted from productivity gains and success in leveraging the global scale of existing production capacity 
management believes the capital spending target range of percent to percent is appropriate 
the net increase in time deposits in was primarily attributable to investment of cash accumulated in korea 
financing commentary at december   total debt and preferred securities was billion  the same as the prior year end 
there were no changes in the corporation s credit ratings in in july  standard poor s s p revised the corporation s credit rating for long term debt from aa to aa 
moody s investor service maintained its short and long term ratings but changed the corporation s outlook to negative from stable  indicating that a ratings downgrade could be possible 
these changes were primarily based on the corporation s business performance in the heightened competitive environment and because s p changed the way in which it evaluates liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

table of contents part ii continued management believes that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the corporation s access to credit or its borrowing costs since these credit ratings remain strong 
the corporation s commercial paper continues to be rated in the top category 
at december   the corporation had billion of revolving credit facilities 
these facilities  unused at december   permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are available for general corporate purposes  including backup for commercial paper borrowings 
the corporation pays commitment fees on the unused portion but may cancel the facilities without penalty at any time prior to their expiration 
of these facilities  million expires in september and the balance expires in november the corporation anticipates that these facilities will be renewed when they expire

in conjunction with this transaction  the fixed annual rate of return on the securities was increased from percent to percent 
approximately percent of these funds were loaned to the corporation which used them to reduce its outstanding commercial paper 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for the full year  the corporation repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock at a cost of about billion  including million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of approximately million 
the monthly detail of share repurchases for the fourth quarter of is included in part ii item of this form k 
on june   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of the corporation s common stock during the next several years 
management believes that the corporation s ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue short term and long term debt are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending  payment of dividends  repurchases of common stock and other needs in the foreseeable future 
variable interest entities the corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and in the synthetic fuel partnerships described above 
financing entities the corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize long term notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets  which were sold in and to nonaffiliated buyers 
these transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
these sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of million and a fair value of approximately million at the date of sale 
the notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks  which aggregated million at december  because the corporation desired to monetize the million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains  in the corporation transferred the notes received from the sale to a noncontrolled financing entity  and in it transferred the notes received from the sale to another noncontrolled financing entity

a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities  has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities 
the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating million and intercompany preferred stock of million to the financing entities  which serve as secondary collateral for the third party lending arrangements 
in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit  the corporation could experience a maximum loss of million under these arrangements 
the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity 
rather  it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting 
the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes 
as a result  the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s luxembourg based financing subsidiary  which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity 
real estate entities effective march   the corporation adopted fin r for its real estate entities described below

the corporation has invested in these markets through i partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner  ii limited liability companies llcs in which it is a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors 
these entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 
adoption of fin r required the corporation to consolidate ten apartment projects and two hotels because it was the primary beneficiary of each of these real estate ventures 
the carrying amount of the assets that serve as collateral for million of obligations of these ventures was million at december   and these assets are classified as property  plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet 
the corporation also has guaranteed million of the obligations of these ventures 
the corporation accounts for its interests in real estate entities that are not consolidated under fin r by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method  as appropriate  and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in its income tax provision 
as of december   the corporation had a net equity of million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities 
the corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately million  million and million for december   and  respectively 
as of december   total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was million

except for the guaranteed portion  permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the corporation 
from time to time  temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the 
table of contents part ii continued corporation 
in general  the corporation s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained 
at december   million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the corporation 
if the corporation s investments in its nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts  a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings 
as of december   this recapture risk is estimated to be million 
the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period  nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need 
accordingly  the recapture risk is considered to be remote 
at december   the corporation s maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be million and was comprised of its net equity in these entities of million  its permanent financing guarantees of million  its interim financing guarantees of million and the income tax credit recapture risk of million 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used 
the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals  pension benefits  retained insurable risks  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities  deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments  and contingencies 
the corporation s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
promotion and rebate accruals among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers 
rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers 
generally  the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption  influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories 
estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred  but unpaid  are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales  timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs 
settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity 
trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees  cooperative marketing programs  temporary price reductions  favorable end of aisle or in store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation s products 
promotion accruals as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
rebate accruals as of december  and were million and million  respectively 

table of contents part ii continued pension benefits the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the principal plans and or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees 
certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or  in certain countries  termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees 
the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation abo 
subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 
funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements  tax considerations  investment opportunities  and customary business practices in such countries 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million in compared with million for pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent in compared with percent in and will be percent in the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors  including input from our pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our us plan s historical year and year compounded annual returns of percent and percent  respectively  which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
we anticipate that on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about percent 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
also  when deemed appropriate  we execute hedging strategies using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level 
we executed such hedging strategies in and no hedging instruments are currently in place 
we will continue to evaluate our long term rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary 
we determine pension expense on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses calculated value over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
we recognize the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets in pension expense more rapidly than we would if we used a calculated value for plan assets 
as of december   the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately billion 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  or ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations  or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
the discount or settlement rate we used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligations at december  was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from year to years 
each year s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rate for our us pension obligations 
for our us principal plans  we established discount rates 
table of contents part ii continued using the long term local government bond rates increased by the interest rate spread between the us discount rate and long term us government bond rates 
the weighted average discount rate for the principal plans decreased to percent at december  from percent at december we estimate that our consolidated pension expense will approximate million in this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets in the principal plans of percent  a weighted average discount rate for the principal plans of percent and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  the corporation s contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
if the expected long term rate of return on assets for our principal plans was lowered by percent  our annual pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by percent  our annual pension expense would increase by approximately million and our december  minimum pension liability would increase by about million 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was billion at december  and december  lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations the pbo of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately billion at december  and december  primarily due to the lower discount rates  the abo of our defined benefit plans exceeded plan assets by about 
billion at the end of at the end of  the abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about 
billion 
on a consolidated basis  the corporation contributed about million to pension trusts in compared with million in in addition  the corporation made direct benefit payments of million in compared to million in while the corporation is not required to make a contribution in to the us plan  the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated 
about million will be contributed to plans outside the us in the discount rate used for each country s pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that country s other postretirement obligation 
the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted average discount rates 
retained insurable risks we retain selected insurable risks  primarily related to property damage  workers compensation  and product  automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management s judgment of cost effective risk retention 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events  principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability  are based upon loss development factors provided to us by our external insurance brokers 
excess and obsolete inventory we require all excess  obsolete  damaged or off quality inventories including raw materials  in process  finished goods  and spare parts to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of 
our process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis 
this process requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections 
the evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis 
no provisions for future obsolescence  damage or off quality inventories are made 

table of contents part ii continued allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents our best estimate of the accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we base our estimate on  among other things  historical collection experience  a review of the current aging status of customer receivables  and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk 
when we become aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable  we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments 
if a customer enters a bankruptcy action  we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for non collectibility is warranted 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively  and our write off of uncollectible accounts was million and million in and  respectively 
property and depreciation estimating the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment  and actual lives may differ from these estimates 
changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate 
property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
for example  if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized  then our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test the carrying amount of goodwill annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment 
the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes  growth rates of selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we also test the sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes  selling prices and costs 
if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible 
table of contents part ii continued impairment would be indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  we would estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
we also use judgment in assessing whether we need to test more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition  product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
we have completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and have determined that none of our billion of goodwill is impaired 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we have other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately million and a net carrying amount of about million 
these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be indicated 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows 
we use judgment in assessing whether the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 
primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under fin r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model  determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values 
estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the exercise of significant management judgment 
the resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each vie in accordance with their beneficial interests 
the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie under fin r 
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as of december   the corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards totaling million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of million  thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset was million 
these income tax losses and credits are in non us taxing jurisdictions and in certain states within the non us in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets  the corporation considers many factors  including the specific taxing jurisdiction  the carryforward period  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for income taxes  special areas 
these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely 
however  they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends  were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate  or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings 
we periodically determine whether our non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 
the 
table of contents part ii continued corporation currently is evaluating the effect of the american jobs creation act on the unremitted earnings of its non us subsidiaries and expects to complete that evaluation by june  at this time  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of unremitted earnings that may be repatriated and the income tax effects of such repatriation 
the corporation records liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments 
the accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions 
these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws  rulings by tax authorities  or the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the corporation s us federal income tax returns have been audited through irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through refund actions are pending in federal district court or the irs appeals office for the years through management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on the corporation s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
contingencies and legal matters litigation the following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative proceedings to which the corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the corporation s or its subsidiaries properties are subject 
in management s opinion  none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below  individually or in the aggregate  is expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
as of december   the corporation  along with many other nonaffiliated companies  was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured  sold  distributed or installed products which cause asbestos related lung disease 
these general allegations are often made against the corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the corporation 
the corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases 
all asbestos claims have been tendered to the corporation s insurance carriers for defense and indemnity 
the financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the corporation s portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these claims 
contingency one of the corporation s north american tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next years 
in the event that the mill was shut down  the corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner  the local utility company 
the net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of december  is estimated to be approximately million 
management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote 
environmental matters the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or analogous state statutes  at a number of waste disposal sites  none of which  individually or in the aggregate  in management s opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents part ii continued new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and spoilage 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the corporation s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r also supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
in general  the accounting required by sfas r is similar to that of sfas however  sfas gave companies a choice to either recognize the fair value of stock options in their income statements or to disclose the pro forma income statement effect of the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements 
sfas r eliminates that choice and requires the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including the fair value of grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement  generally over the option vesting period 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption is permitted 
sfas r permits adoption of its requirements using one of two transition methods a modified prospective transition mpt method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective transition mrt method which includes the requirements of the mpt method described above  but also permits restatement of financial statements based on the amounts previously disclosed under sfas s pro forma disclosure requirements either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the corporation is currently evaluating the timing and manner in which it will adopt sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  the corporation currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  has recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a slight effect on results of operations  although it will have no impact on overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had sfas r been adopted in prior periods  the effect would have approximated the sfas pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required  thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods because they depend on  among other things  when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the corporation s stock at the time of exercise  the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
business outlook for  the corporation is targeting sales growth of to percent  consistent with its long term objective 
based on plans to drive innovation  the gain is expected to come largely from improvement in sales volumes  
table of contents part ii continued with price  mix and currency assumed to be about flat 
the corporation is targeting to deliver million in cost savings  which should help improve operating profit margin by up to basis points despite inflationary cost increases 
the corporation expects to deliver earnings of to per share for the year  representing mid to high single digit growth compared with net income from continuing operations of in cash flow is expected to continue to be strong which will enable the corporation to again return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in common share repurchases are currently targeted to be at least billion during the year and dividends on common stock have been increased by percent effective with the april payment 
capital spending is estimated to be million in  which should be toward the low end of the corporation s long term target of to percent of net sales 
for the first quarter of  earnings are expected to be in a range of to cents per share compared with earnings per share from continuing operations of cents in this would represent growth of approximately to percent  similar to the expected level of improvement for the full year 
the corporation is planning to step up its marketing spending in the quarter compared with the prior year to support a very active schedule of product launches  including huggies toiletries  new pull ups training pants with wetness indicators and scott extra soft bathroom tissue 
the corporation also expects to face continued cost increases in the first quarter  particularly for fiber as well as resin and other oil based materials 
information concerning forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report concerning  among other things  the business outlook  including new product introductions  cost savings  anticipated financial and operating results  strategies  contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation  constitute forward looking statements and are based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation 
there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation s results will be as estimated 
the assumptions used as a basis for the forward looking statements include many estimates that  among other things  depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases 
in addition  many factors outside the control of the corporation  including the prices and availability of the corporation s raw materials  potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation s products  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business  also could impact the realization of such estimates 
for a description of these and other factors that could cause the corporation s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements  see item i of this annual report on form k entitled factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions 
the corporation s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to these agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date 
credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 

table of contents part ii continued presented below is a description of our most significant risks foreign currency risk  interest rate risk and commodity price risk together with a sensitivity analysis  performed annually  of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices 
these analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one year period 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts 
the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
prior to  foreign currency risk was managed by the selective  rather than the systematic  use of foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts 
management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 
foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year end 
the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate s net monetary asset or liability position by a percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately million 
these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december  rates and the assumed rates 
in the view of management  the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
consequently  we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non us operations by a percent change in the currency exchange rates 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately million 
these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december  exchange rates and the assumed rates 
in the view of management  the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation s consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management 
table of contents part ii continued deems appropriate 
at december   the debt portfolio was composed of approximately percent variable rate debt and percent fixed rate debt 
the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a target mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the corporation s target for variable rate debt is percent to percent and is designed to balance the corporation s cost of financing with its interest rate risk 
we perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test 
the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to fixed rate debt outstanding at december   a percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed rate debt by about million 
the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable rate debt 
with respect to commercial paper and other variable rate debt  a percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 
commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp 
selling prices of tissue products are influenced  in part  by the market price for pulp  which is determined by industry supply and demand 
on a worldwide basis prior to the spin off  the corporation supplied approximately percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations 
the spin off has reduced the internal pulp supply to approximately percent 
as previously discussed under factors that may affect future results  increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices 
derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 
in addition  the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities  primarily natural gas  which are used in its manufacturing operations 
derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management 
management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation s business or its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
