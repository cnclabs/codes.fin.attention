overview of significant events on february   we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  igc polycold systems  inc polycold  to helix technology corporation helix 
helix purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of polycold for about million in cash  which included a contractual  reimbursement representing the company s estimate for certain tax obligations 
the decision to sell polycold was a step in our overall strategic plan to focus financial and managerial resources on the company s highly profitable and more consistently growing and more profitable medical devices business 
the sale  which resulted in a pre tax gain of about million  was included in income from discontinued operations 
we utilized the net proceeds from the sale of polycold and a portion of existing cash balances to pay off the million that was outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility at the end of our third fiscal quarter 
on july   we completed our purchase of mri devices corporation mrid  a privately held company 
mrid is a leading manufacturer of radio frequency rf coils and related sub systems for magnetic resonance imaging mri systems 
as a result of the acquisition  mrid became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the deal was structured as a cash and stock transaction which included a million cash payment  a three year million promissory note and  shares of company common stock  of which about  shares the plan shares were allocated to fund employee benefit plans for mrid employees 
about  of these plan shares with a value of  was recorded as compensation expense as a result of accelerating the vesting requirements during the three months ended november  and about  plan shares with a value of  are being recognized as compensation expense ratably over a contractual four year vesting period 
the company recognized  of compensation expense from vesting during the year ended may  the remaining  shares were issued as consideration with a value of million based on the average closing stock price for two days prior to and after the measurement date which was determined to be june   in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
fifty percent of the stock is restricted from sale for two years from the date of closing and the other fifty percent for three years 
the cash portion of the consideration was financed through our credit facility that was amended to expand the aggregate committed amount by million to million 
mrid s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are included in our discussion on the results of operations below 
since the acquisition  we have combined mrid and our pre existing rf coil subsidiary igc medical advances into one entity invivo diagnostic imaging  a division of invivo corporation 
this has resulted in adding incremental value to this acquisition through the physical consolidation of product development and manufacturing facilities in wisconsin  a unified rf coil management team and the integration of direct sales activities with invivo corporation s global sales team 
on july   our board of directors declared a three for two split on all outstanding shares of our common stock 
the split was completed in the form of a fifty percent stock dividend  effective august   to stockholders of record on july  all share and per share data included in this filing have been adjusted to retroactively reflect this stock dividend 
during fiscal year we completed our purchase of invivo corporation  which was acquired through a public tender offer 
invivo designs  manufactures and markets patient monitoring systems 
these monitoring systems measure and display vital signs of patients in medical settings  particularly during magnetic resonance imaging procedures 
as a result of the acquisition  invivo became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition of invivo substantially expanded our direct sales team and customer base 
invivo now operates two divisions invivo patient care ipc develops and manufactures patient monitors and invivo diagnostic imaging idi develops and manufactures rf coils and related subsystems 
invivo s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are included in our discussion on results of operations below 
segment structure as a result of the sale of polycold  the sole subsidiary in our instrumentation segment  our reportable segments from continuing operations now consist of magnetic resonance imaging mri  medical devices  and energy technology 
the mri segment consists of igc mbg which manufactures and sells low temperature superconducting lts magnets that are used in mri systems 
previously this segment included oem sales of radio frequency rf coils  which are now included in the medical devices segment 
all prior year data has been restated to reflect this change 
our medical devices segment now consists of one collectively managed entity  invivo corporation with a universal brand identity of invivo 
invivo s management team concentrates on the collective growth  revenues and profitability of its portfolio of products including rf coils  vital sign patient monitors  visualization and analysis products and service for these products 
rf coils are application specific devices that work as a part of the overall mri system to create images of specific anatomical areas of the body 
examples include breast  head  knee and wrist rf coils 
these products are sold directly to major original equipment manufacturers including philips medical systems philips  ge healthcare ge  siemens medical solutions siemens and toshiba medical systems toshiba 
these products are also sold directly to healthcare providers through invivo s direct global sales network comprised of direct sales representatives and independent distributors 
vital sign monitoring products are devices used throughout hospital acute care departments  ambulatory surgical outpatient centers  hospital based radiology departments  and free standing diagnostic imaging centers 
these products monitor and display respiratory and cardiac vital signs such as temperature  heart rate and blood pressure 
invivo offers both mri compatible monitors for use in the mri imaging suite and bedside monitors with central viewing systems at central nurse stations 
visualization and analysis systems are software based products used in conjunction with rf coils in diagnostic imaging and interventional diagnostic procedures 
invivo provides service through company operated repair centers 
an integral part of invivo s sales and marketing strategy is a corporate and national account program 
invivo enters into supply agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell products to the gpo member hospitals or healthcare facilities 
in energy technology  our wholly owned subsidiary  superpower  inc superpower is developing high temperature superconducting materials and devices designed to enhance the capacity  reliability and quality of electrical power transmission and distribution 
the company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income loss 
the company operates on a week fiscal year ending the last sunday during the month of may 
fiscal was a week fiscal year ending may  we also have a foreign sales corporation located in barbados 
there was no activity in our foreign sales corporation during fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon  in part  on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 on product that has been shipped 
in these cases  all the criteria for revenue recognition have been met including  but not limited to persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement includes a product price that is fixed and determinable  the company has accomplished what it must do to satisfy the terms of the arrangement including passing title and risk of loss to our customer upon shipment  and collection from our customer is reasonably assured in accordance with the terms in the arrangement 
in other instances  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 on product that is complete and ready to ship for which our customer has requested a delay in delivery 
in these cases  all the criteria for revenue recognition have been met including  but not limited to the customer has a substantial business purpose  there is a fixed delivery date  title and risk of loss has transferred to our customer  the product is complete and ready for shipment  and the product has been segregated and is not available to be used to fill other orders 
upon notification from our customer the product is shipped to the stated destination 
as of may   may   and may  bill and hold sales comprised  and of annual consolidated revenue from continuing operations  respectively 
the company recognizes revenue and profit on long term development contracts based upon actual time and material costs incurred plus contractual earned profit 
these types of contracts typically provide engineering services to achieve a specific scientific result relating to superconductivity 
the customers for these contracts are both commercial customers and various state and federal government agencies 
when government agencies are providing revenue we do not expect the government to be a significant end user of the resulting products 
therefore  the company does not reduce product research and development by the funding received 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated receivable losses 
management considers historical collection experience and reviews aging reports on its outstanding receivable balances on a regular basis to assess the collectibility of these balances  and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
increases to the allowance are expensed and included in operating expenses 
the allowance and the related receivable are reduced when the account is deemed uncollectible 
inventory reserves the company maintains a reserve for inventory that has become damaged in the manufacturing process or technologically obsolete 
if technology advances more rapidly than expected  manufacturing processes improve substantially or the market for our products declines substantially  adjustments to reserves may be required 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as significant changes in the business climate  plant closures  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
additionally  the company performs a test for goodwill impairment annually during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired is calculated using estimated discounted future cash flows of the operations associated with the related reporting unit and involves significant judgments such as long term revenue projections  weighted average cost of capital  product cost reductions  market penetration and sufficient product research and development to keep pace with market demand 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
warranty reserves the provision for warranty for potential defects with our manufactured products is based on historical experience for the period the product was under warranty during the fiscal year 
in some cases  when historical warranty information is not available the company estimates warranty costs based on spending related to the cost centers responsible for the warranty repair 
the company believes these reserves are adequate based on the evaluation criteria  procedures in place to control the manufacturing process and pre testing of newly developed products to ensure their manufacturability prior to commercial introduction 
if product quality declines  the company may require additional provisions 
reserve for environmental remediation the company maintains a provision for potential environmental remediation for businesses disposed of during fiscal see also note h in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
these provisions are based upon management s best estimate under the given circumstances and available information 
our provision did not include any range of loss 
therefore  we are unable to identify or estimate any additional loss that is reasonably possible 
the company believes these provisions are adequate 
if unexpected costs related to the environmental issues are incurred additional provisions will be needed 
results of operations continuing operations consolidated revenue for the year ended may  net revenues increased million or nearly to million from million in the prior year 
improved performance from all segments contributed to the increase 
increased magnet sales  the acquisition of mrid and increased billing from the energy technology segment were some of the factors contributing to the improved revenues 
during the year ended may  revenues increased million or to million primarily from the acquisition of invivo and increased billings on existing contracts from the energy technology segment partially offset by declines from the mri segment 
during the year ended may  revenues were million 
revenues mri segment as of may  net year to date sales for the mri segment increased million or to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was related to increased magnet volume and an improved magnet mix of the higher field strength magnets partially offset by previously negotiated reductions in magnet selling prices 
additionally  fiscal had an unusually low first quarter relating to supply chain management described below 
during fiscal sales of the mri segment decreased million from the prior year  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a planned reduction in magnet shipments during the first fiscal quarter related to the transition of managing supply chain logistics for philips in return for an enhanced and extended exclusive supply contract 
in addition  an unfavorable magnet mix combined with lower contractual selling prices more than offset an increase in magnet volume during the remainder of the year 
during the year ended may  sales of the mri segment were million 
revenues medical devices segment during fiscal sales of the medical devices segment increased million to million from million in the previous year 
this increase is primarily related to the benefit of a full year of sales from the acquisition of invivo corporation and the benefit of ten months of sales from the acquisition of mrid 
for the period ended may  the medical devices segment provided million of sales  an increase of million primarily as the result of the acquisition of invivo and access to a larger direct sales force for additional sales of rf coils 
during fiscal sales from this segment were nearly million 
revenues energy technology segment for the period ended may  the energy technology segment revenues increased million to million from million in the prior year 
this revenue increase is primarily related to increased effort on existing programs relating to superconducting wire and devices 
during fiscal year  revenues in the energy technology segment increased million to million 
this is a result of increased revenues from billings against existing contracts provided by our industry partners and various state and federal agencies 
during the fiscal year ended may   revenues in the energy technology segment were million 
consolidated gross margin consolidated gross margin for the year ended may  increased million or greater then to million from million in the prior year 
as a percent of revenues gross margin increased from in fiscal to in the current year 
all units have contributed to the increase in gross margin 
the mri segment contributed approximately million of the increase as a result of increased volume and continuous cost reduction as well as favorable product mix partially offset by previously negotiated price reductions 
invivo diagnostic imaging idi gross margin increased million based on improved sales resulting  in part  from additional products made available to our sales force as a result of the acquisition of mrid 
as a percent of revenues  gross margin from idi declined to from reflecting charges that in management s judgment related to acquisition and integration activities 
invivo patient care ipc gross profit increased million as a result of increased sales of both patient monitors and direct sales of rf coils from the acquisition of mrid 
as a percent of revenues  gross margin declined to from  again  resulting from acquisition and integration related charges 
energy technology gross margin increased to million from million in the previous year 
about million of the increased margin is related to increased revenues partially offset by the benefit of  gross profit in fiscal without any costs 
the costs related to this profit were recognized in fiscal prior to funding being authorized 
consolidated gross margin for the fiscal year ended may   was million  which represents an increase of million or over fiscal as a percent of revenues  gross margin increased to compared to during fiscal the increase in both absolute dollars and percent of revenues was primarily driven by the inclusion of million of margin from higher margin sales of our medical devices segment 
in our mri segment  gross margin decreased million or to million 
the decline was principally due to unfavorable magnet mix  price reductions and lower sales volumes primarily during the first fiscal quarter as discussed above 
margins from the energy technology segment increased about million corresponding to the increased revenue under government and third party contracts and the receipt of about million of funding for costs incurred in the prior year 
this additional funding was the result of two government contracts that were negotiated during fiscal year with a provision to bill for costs expensed in fiscal year during the year ended may  consolidated gross margin was million 
consolidated operating expenses product research and development during fiscal product research and development increased million to million from nearly million in fiscal approximately million of this increase is related to medical device segment spending relating to the development of the next generation of our existing product and new products based  in part  on customer requested additional functionality of both patient monitors and rf coils 
product research and development spending in the mri segment increased million related to fiscal was artificially low as a result of customer funding 
energy technology segment increased million as a result of additional cost share related to increased revenue 
product research and development increased  or to nearly million during fiscal this increase primarily resulted from increased spending on various high temperature superconducting hts projects of about million in our energy technology segment 
in the mri segment  spending decreased million as third party funding increased for continued development on magnet systems 
our medical devices segment contributed million of the increase relating to new product development 
it is important to note that increased activities in product research and development during fiscal across all segments benefited through externally provided third party funding 
during fiscal research and development expense was million 
selling  general and administrative during fiscal selling  general and administrative and stock based compensation increased million to million from million last year 
about million is related to the addition of mrid and a full year of invivo in our consolidation 
the re branding of mrid into invivo impaired the intangible asset of the mrid trade name in the amount of  net of amortization 
additionally  a non cash charge of million was taken during the year relating to a stock contribution made to a profit sharing plan for the original mrid shareholders  prior to the acquisition 
as a condition of the purchase of mrid the company agreed to honor an agreement to provide key mrid employees certain non cash stock compensation benefits of about million recognized as a non cash expense 
during fiscal the company also incurred a non cash expense for performance based stock compensation of million as our financial results achieved the growth targets established by the compensation committee of the board of directors and approved by the stockholders 
an additional million is related to increased audit and tax as well as sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
finally   of additional compensation was recognized resulting from the unrealized gain on the company s tax deferred compensation plan 
an equal and offsetting gain was recognized in interest income with no impact on net income 
during the fiscal year ended may   selling  general and administrative expenses and stock based compensation increased million or to million from fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of invivo s selling  general and administrative expenses of about million as well as the due diligence and integration related expenses associated with the acquisition which totaled about million 
in addition  salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and other employee related expenses increased about million  primarily in the mri segment 
this increase is a result of filling open positions as well as creating new positions that correspond with our expected future growth 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative and stock based compensation were million 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million increased million over last year 
the increase is due to the addition of the amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of invivo on january  and mrid on july  fiscal year included only four months of amortization relating to invivo 
during fiscal year  amortization of intangible assets increased million or from fiscal year primarily due to the addition of amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of invivo corporation 
amortization expense in fiscal year was million 
impairment of intangible asset during our second fiscal quarter of  management  through re branding exercises and market analysis  determined that the acquired mri devices trade name with an acquired value of  will no longer be utilized 
as a result  the company reduced the net book value of the acquired mri devices trade name to zero resulting in an impairment charge of  operating income operating income during fiscal increased million or to million from fiscal this increase is primarily due to improved revenues and gross margins across all segments as well as the inclusion of operations from our acquisition of mrid in july of and our acquisition of invivo in january these increases were partially offset by increases in internal acquisition and integration costs  as well as increased audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs  combined with the increases in amortization and stock based compensation 
during fiscal year  operating income of million decreased million or from operating income of million during fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of reduced magnet sales in our mri segment during the first quarter of fiscal year additionally  we incurred about million of internal acquisition and integration charges associated with the acquisition of invivo 
partially offsetting the mri segment decrease of million was the increase from the medical devices segment of million primarily driven by the contributions of invivo 
additionally  the net operating loss from our energy technology segment decreased about  interest and other interest and other income for fiscal of million increased  or from fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a  increase in earnings from the company s income tax deferred compensation plan 
an equal and offsetting compensation charge was recorded as an operating expense in accordance with eitf during fiscal year  interest and other income of  decreased about  from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by the continued decline in the interest rate environment as well as our lower cash balances resulting from funding our acquisition of invivo 
interest and other expense of million increased nearly million over prior year 
this increase is primarily driven by the interest expense from the million borrowed under our million unsecured credit facility used to partially finance our acquisition of invivo and mrid  combined with about million of debt assumed in our acquisitions and a million three year note payable accruing interest at libor plus issued in conjunction with the mrid acquisition 
as of may   we had million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and million outstanding on our term loan portion of our unsecured credit facility 
during fiscal year  interest and other expense of million increased  from  in fiscal year this increase is primarily driven by the interest expense from the million of proceeds borrowed under our million unsecured credit facility used to partially finance our acquisition of invivo 
as of may   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
during the year ended may   million of other income was recognized resulting from a reduction in the provision for potential environmental remediation relating to a business disposed of during fiscal see also note h in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
management originally estimated this liability based upon information received from professional site assessments 
during the first fiscal quarter ended august   management determined that the probable risk of loss was only  which resulted in a net reduction in the accrual of million 
as of may  and may  approximately  and  remains on the company s balance sheet in other liabilities and accrued expenses 
in may  the company sold its  shares of kryotech  inc a privately held corporation for total proceeds and a gross realized gain of  in october  fiscal the company sold its remaining  shares of ultralife batteries  inc for total proceeds of approximately million with a gross realized loss of approximately million 
in connection with the sale a net  unrealized holding loss of  has been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  during fiscal the company received  as a result of a favorable settlement of trade litigation 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations of for fiscal decreased from last year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from reversals of certain tax accruals amounting to about  based upon management s review of certain discreet events and the resulting impact to historical tax requirements combined with an increased benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
we do not expect our effective tax rate to remain this low during fiscal  due to our acquisitions  which are registered to do business in additional states 
therefore  we expect our effective tax rate to be about for fiscal year in addition  we are currently determining the potential benefit from the qualified production activity deductions of the american jobs creation act of as our historical benefit from the extra territorial income regime is being phased out 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year of was consistent with fiscal we continue to review effective tax strategies to minimize our effective tax rate 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and capital gains during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income  the character of such income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company had federal taxable income including discontinued operations and the gain on sale of polycold of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the remaining deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
discontinued operations as a result of the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  igc polycold systems  inc  effective february   and in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we have classified the income from operations and the related gain on sale as discontinued operations 
all prior periods have been restated to reflect this treatment 
polycold s revenues and net operating profit included in discontinued operations is as follows in thousands for the year ended may  may  may  net revenues to external customers    net operating income    polycold s revenues for fiscal year decreased million or from last year to nearly million 
the decrease is primarily the result of fiscal year having three and a half fewer months of operations partially offset by product revenues and service growth for vacuum related products across a broad range of non semiconductor customers in the united states and the pacific rim 
during fiscal year  polycold s revenues increased million to million or from nearly million in fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by continued sales and service growth in our vacuum market in both asia and the united states as well as slowly increasing demand in the semiconductor market during the latter part of fiscal year polycold s net operating income in fiscal year through the date of sale increased nearly million or to million over last year despite having three and a half fewer months of operations 
the increases are primarily driven by improved margins due to manufacturing cost reductions through successful lean manufacturing initiatives in addition to a decrease in total operating expenses 
during fiscal year  polycold s net operating income increased nearly million to million or from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and related gross margin as operating expenses remained relatively consistent 
effective with the sale of polycold and also included in discontinued operations for the year ended may   was the million gain on sale which is calculated as follows in thousands cash proceeds received  less polycold net assets sold  costs directly related to the sale  pre tax gain on sale  forward looking looking forward  into fiscal year  we expect sales to increase primarily from both the mri and medical devices segments 
the mri segment growth is expected to come from increased sales related to high field t and t open magnet systems 
we anticipate revenue growth from our medical devices segment driven by increased rf coil sales in the direct market leveraging off of a full year contribution from our acquisition of mrid 
in addition  we expect sales of patient monitors to be consistent with fiscal year we expect our net loss for investment in superpower energy technology segment to remain at about fiscal levels 
revenues from the energy technology segment are expected to increase during fiscal through increased funding opportunities 
as we advance through the construction and installation phase of our superconducting cable project we continue to anticipate a successful physical demonstration of high temperature superconducting technology on a commercial grid in calendar year additionally we expect continued progress towards developing products for external market commercialization 
the company will continue to seek partners with enhancing technology to participate in our projects in order to share both costs and technology  as demonstrated in the cable project 
additionally  in fiscal year  similar with last year  we expect to experience seasonality in our sales 
we expect that the first quarter of each year  which includes slower summer months  will be the lightest because of buying patterns of our expanded customer base 
the second quarter is expected to be substantially stronger  followed by a somewhat softer third quarter  which includes a number of globally observed holidays 
the fourth quarter is generally expected to be the strongest of the year 
during fiscal year  we anticipate a decrease in total operating expenses from fiscal year driven by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily associated with the significant acquisition and integration related charges that were incurred during fiscal year partially offsetting this decrease are expected increases in product research and development expenses as products and projects across all segments are continuously being developed 
typically  our customers are actively involved in the definition and development of these products 
in addition  we expect an increase in performance based stock compensation as a larger portion of management s restricted stock award plan is expected to vest based on satisfying certain pre specified financial performance measures 
additionally  the company has an active cost cutting program in each of its divisions to increase earnings 
these expectations are based on the following assumptions  among others o the market for mri systems continues to grow  o order trends for mri magnets continue to improve  o major oem customers continue to purchase rf coils at increasing levels  o customer acceptance of the new products being developed throughout the company  o new products  existing products and upgrades to existing products achieve the level of growth and market acceptance expected  o third party funding is available for energy technology to continue its research  o partners are available to continue to help offset some of the unfunded costs related to this research  o the company is able to locate and retain qualified people for various positions  o we are able to maintain gross margins through continued production cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies  o the company does not experience any interruption of supply of our critical materials used in all of our segments  o if such a disruption does occur we are able to find alternate sources expeditiously  o we are able to effectively compete with our competitors in the mri and medical devices segments in regards to pricing  product reliability  technical features  performance and service  o we are able to continue to submit and gain approval for products from the fda under the section k of the code pre market notification process rather than the more time consuming and costly pre market approval process  o we are able to continue to operate under fda approval in our manufacturing facilities requiring such approval  and o we are continually able to effectively integrate current and future acquisitions o no additional integration costs are required 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for the fiscal year ended may  we generated million from operations compared to million in fiscal year the increase is primarily driven by improved earnings 
in addition  significant fluctuations within working capital items provided a slight favorable impact on cash 
the most significant generation came from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million nearly offset by cash uses from increases in accounts receivable and inventory and other assets of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended may   the million generated from operations was primarily due to earnings partially offset by an unfavorable fluctuation in working capital primarily driven by increases in both accounts receivable and inventory and other assets of million and million  respectively 
investing activities for the year ended may   investing activities resulted in a use of cash of million compared to cash used of million last year 
the use of cash during the current fiscal year is primarily due to cash paid to acquire mrid of million  net of cash acquired  purchases of property and equipment of million and  for other investing activity requirements 
these uses of cash were nearly offset by the million  net of transaction costs and a tax reimbursement received from the sale of polycold 
the significant use of cash during the year ended may  was primarily due to the cash used to fund our acquisition of invivo of about million combined with purchases of property and equipment of about million partially offset by the collection of a million note receivable relating to a disposition in fiscal and proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of  the net cash received from the sale of polycold effective february   consisted of the following cash received cash received from sale  cash received as reimbursement for certain tax obligations less cash on polycold s balance sheet transaction costs  the cash used from our acquisition of mrid effective july   consisted of the following cash paid cash paid to mrid shareholders  transaction costs  less cash acquired from mrid  financing activities financing activities for the year ended may   used about million of cash 
during the fourth quarter  we borrowed million on our revolving credit facility to cover temporary timing differences in our working capital requirements which included a million tax payment primarily related to the gain on sale of polycold 
prior to year end  we repaid half of this borrowing leaving million outstanding on our revolving facility as of may  additionally  we used million of proceeds received from long term borrowings to partially finance the acquisition of mrid 
during our third fiscal quarter  the proceeds received from the sale of polycold combined with available operating cash were used to pay down nearly million of our credit facility 
these events increased our total proceeds from long term borrowings to million and also increased our total year to date debt repayments to million 
total long term debt including the current portion was million as of may  the remaining financing activities reflects the cash received from the exercise of stock options of million and payments received from employees under the executive stock purchase plan of  partially offset by the purchase of treasury shares of million and  for payments made to amend our credit facility 
financing activities during the year ended may  consisted of proceeds from long term borrowings of million used to partially fund our acquisition of invivo reduced by principal payments of million and costs paid to obtain the credit facility of million 
other financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and payments received from employees under the executive stock purchase plan of  partially offset by million for the purchase of treasury shares 
see the consolidated statement of cash flows  located elsewhere in this report  for further details on sources and uses of cash 
commitments our capital and resource commitments at july  consisted of capital equipment commitments of  as of may   our total contractual obligations for the next five fiscal years are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year non cancelable operating lease commitments      purchase commitments  minimum pension liability interest payments on long term debt  principal payments on long term debt     represents estimated interest payments on long term debt using current interest rates as of may  adequate resources we believe we have adequate resources to meet our needs for the short term from our existing cash balances  our expected cash generation in fiscal  and availability under our unsecured million credit facility 
in the longer term  we may need to raise additional funds if we experience substantial increases in sales volume or unusually large research and development or capital expenditure requirements 
additional funds could also be required for pursuing new opportunities in the energy technology segment or in meeting business development opportunities through additional acquisitions 
we would expect to be able to do so through additional lines of credit  public offerings or private placements of securities 
however  in the event funds were not available from these sources  or on acceptable terms  we would expect to manage our growth within the financing available 
inflation has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to intermagnetics common stock

any of these could have a material and negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the risk factors included elsewhere in this report the company is subject to risk associated with acquisitions 
the company acquired invivo corporation effective january   mri devices corporation mrid effective july   and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of the operations  services  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  overvaluation of the acquired companies  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies and lack of acceptance by the marketplace of the acquired companies products or services 
future acquisitions may also result in dilution to existing stockholders  the use of a substantial portion of the company s cash  the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges or amortization expense 
moreover  the company may face exposure to litigation and other unanticipated contingent liabilities of the acquired companies 
any of these problems or factors with respect to the acquisition of invivo and mrid or any other acquisition completed by the company could result in a material adverse effect to the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may on occasion be subject to significant litigation 
the company does business in the critical healthcare setting  and may from time to time be subject to significant litigation arising from actual or alleged injuries to patients 
litigation is by its nature costly and may divert management s attention  either of which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  if any current or future litigation is determined adversely  the company s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company is subject to risk of new laws related to health care 
the company s customer base includes original equipment manufacturers of medical diagnostic equipment  imaging centers  small rural hospitals and other healthcare providers 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant effect on the company s costs of doing business and the amount of reimbursement the company and its customers receive from both government and third party payers 
in addition  economic forces  regulatory influences and political initiatives are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes 
federal  state and local government representatives are likely to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods 
the company expects ongoing public debate on these issues 
any of these efforts or reforms could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a small number of customers  and any decrease in revenue from these customers could harm our operating results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in our customers orders may have a significant impact on our operating results 
if a major customer significantly reduces the amount of business it does with us  there would be an adverse impact on our operating results see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in response to item 
although we have broadened our customer base over the past fiscal year  we will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers 
because it often takes significant time to replace lost business  it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel  delay or reduce significant orders in the future 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with the products we sell to our major customers 
although our major customers are large corporations  if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise be unable to pay for our products  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
competition from existing or new companies could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share 
our mri and medical device segments operate in a highly competitive industry 
we are subject to competition based upon product design  performance  pricing  quality and service 
while we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products that are directly comparable to products manufactured by others  in many instances our products will conform to more exacting specifications and carry a higher price than analogous products manufactured by others 
our competitors include divisions of much larger  more diversified organizations as well as a number of specialized companies 
some of them have greater resources and larger staffs than we have 
many of our oem customers and potential oem customers have the capacity to design and manufacture internally the products we manufacture for them 
we face competition from research and product development groups and the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal research and product development and manufacturing versus outsourcing 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for our components  and our production would be substantially curtailed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are not available 
we order raw materials and components to complete our customers orders  and some of these raw materials and components are ordered from sole source suppliers 
although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components  we sometimes experience short term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
if a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur  we might have to delay shipments or pay premium pricing  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  supply shortages of particular components will substantially curtail production of products using these components 
we are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers 
accordingly  some raw material and component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
uncertainties and adverse trends affecting the medical device industry  including the markets of any of our major customers may adversely affect our operating results 
our business depends primarily on the mri market  which is subject to rapid technological change and pricing and margin pressure 
in addition  changes in government policy relating to reimbursement for the purchase and use of medical capital equipment could also affect our sales 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our new products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products in the medical device segment are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight 
a delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our new products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a further risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda rules and regulations  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices 
medical device products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their industry experience and their technological expertise 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and depend on the services of our key senior executives and our technological experts 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically engineering and operations personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
our success depends on new product development 
we have continuing development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products 
we are expending significant resources on the development of new products in all of our segments 
the successful development of our products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including o unanticipated delays  o access to capital  o budget overruns  o technical problems  and o other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products  including  for example  changes requested by the fda in connection with pre market approval applications for our medical device products or lack of government funding for our hts initiatives 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects 
our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications 
we are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products 
newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects 
in addition  these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications 
if  despite our internal testing and testing by our customers  any of our products contains errors or defects or any of our products fails to meet customer specifications  then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies 
we may not be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  and may only be able to do so at considerable expense 
in addition  any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction  negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects 
there are a number of technological challenges that must be successfully addressed before our hts products can gain widespread commercial acceptance 
our hts products are in the early stages of commercialization or development and we must successfully address a number of technological challenges to complete our development and commercialization efforts 
we will also need to improve the performance and or reduce the cost of our hts wire to expand the number of commercial applications for it 
we may be unable to meet such technological challenges 
delays in development  as a result of technological challenges or other factors  may result in the termination of certain hts product development efforts or delays in the introduction or commercial acceptance of our products 
a widespread commercial market for our hts products may not develop 
to date  there has been no widespread commercial use of hts products 
it is possible that the market demands we currently anticipate for our hts products will not develop even if technological hurdles are overcome and that hts products will never achieve widespread commercial acceptance 
many of our hts projects are dependent upon government funding  subcontractors and other business partners 
we partner with other companies  including cable manufacturers and suppliers of cryogenic systems on many of our hts projects  such as our hts cable installation program 
accordingly  most of our current and planned revenue generating projects involve business partners on whose performance our revenue and technical success is dependent 
if these business partners fail to deliver their products or perform their obligations on a timely basis  our revenue from these projects may be delayed or decreased and our technical success may be jeopardized 
a significant source of revenue for our hts projects is the us government eg  the department of energy and this funding is subject to annual appropriations 
if the amount committed to each project is not appropriated annually  then our revenue for hts projects may be substantially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company s exposure to market risk through foreign currency exchange  derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  such as investments in short term cash equivalents and long term debt  is not material 
the company has minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales as the company s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations and an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
the financial instruments of the company that are interest rate dependent are mortgages payable and an unsecured million credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit and an amortizing million term loan 
the company manages interest rates through various methods within existing contracts 
on its mortgage payable  the company negotiated an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate at 
with respect to its unsecured credit facility the company may elect to apply interest rates to borrowings under x the higher of wachovia s prime commercial lending rate or the federal funds rate plus applicable margins or y the applicable london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins  whichever is more favorable 
in addition  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that in effect  fixes the rate on its million term loan at plus applicable margins 
see also note n to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of changing rates on earnings and cash flow and to lower its borrowing costs 
with regards to invested cash the company invests only in high quality  low risk securities backed by the full faith of the united states government 
the duration of these securities are an average weighted duration of days 
additionally  the company makes certain estimates about inventory value  collectability of accounts receivable  warranty expense and market acceptance of new product under development 
we use factors such as probability of use  ability of a customer to pay  historical experience of product repair and customer need and or acceptance of new products in making the associated estimates 
these estimates are believed to be reasonable and based on information available at the time the estimate is made
