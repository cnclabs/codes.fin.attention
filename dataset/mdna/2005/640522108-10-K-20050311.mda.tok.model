item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company using our enzymatic technologies to develop proprietary drugs  focusing primarily on therapeutic proteins 
we believe that our core enzymatic technologies  glycoadvance and glycopegylation  improve the drug properties of therapeutic proteins by building out  and attaching polyethylene glycol peg to  carbohydrate structures on the proteins 
we are using our technologies to develop proprietary versions of protein drugs with proven safety and efficacy and to improve the therapeutic profiles of proteins being developed by our partners 
we expect these modified proteins to offer significant advantages  including less frequent dosing and possibly improved efficacy  over the original versions of the drugs now on the market  as well as to meet or exceed the pharmacokinetic profile of next generation versions of the drugs now on the market 
we believe this strategy of targeting drugs with proven safety and efficacy allows us to lower the risk profile of our proprietary development portfolio as compared to de novo protein drug development 
we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we expect additional losses in and over the next several years as we expand product research and development efforts  increase manufacturing scale up activities and expand our intellectual property portfolio 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our february public offering of common stock  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through mid  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and cash equivalents sooner than the above estimate 
under agreements we entered into with a bank during the first quarter of  we have agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to  as of december   our total outstanding debt was  at any time after january   or if we fail to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least  the bank has the option to require additional collateral from us in the form of a security interest in certain cash and short term investments  or in the form of a letter of credit  which may have the effect of requiring us to repay the outstanding loan balance to the bank 
see financing activities debt financing activities term loan from bank and industrial development authority bonds in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k for a description of the material features of this borrowing 
liquidity and capital resources overview we had  in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of december   compared to approximately  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  the decrease for was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and debt repayments  which were partly offset by proceeds of equity and debt financings 
in february  we offered and sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately  in march  we implemented measures to reduce the rate of our cash utilization 
previously  we had estimated that our average quarterly net cash utilization for would be approximately million  based on estimates of revenues from collaborations  and operating expenses 
as a result of these actions  we now estimate that our average quarterly net cash utilization will be approximately million  starting in the second quarter of the actions included modifying the bonus program for officers  reducing officers base salaries for one year  reducing planned operating expenses and capital expenditures  and effectively limiting headcount during the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics  which we are pursuing both independently and in collaboration with selected partners  will require substantial expenditures by us and our collaborators 
to finance those expenditures  we plan to continue financing our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from existing and future collaborative agreements 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 
other than revenues from our collaborations with novo nordisk and biogenerix  and any future collaborations with others  we do not expect to generate significant revenues until such time as products incorporating our technologies are commercialized  which is not expected during the next several years 
we expect an additional several years to elapse before we can expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operating and investing requirements 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our february public offering of common stock  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through mid accordingly  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our operations until we are generating sufficient cash flow from operations 
operating activities during  our operating activities consumed  compared to  in the increase in net cash used in in operating activities is substantially the result of our increased operating loss  offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense over the prior year resulted primarily from the commencement of amortization of leasehold improvements that were placed in service in april we used cash of  during to fund changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and other current assets and decreases in accrued compensation and accounts payable 
during the year ended december   accounts receivable and other current assets increased by  primarily due to an increase in our receivables from collaborative partners 
our uses of cash during were offset in part by an increase of  in deferred revenue 
this increase was due  in part  to the receipt from biogenerix of an upfront fee under our collaborative agreement  partially offset by the amortization of up front payments 
fluctuations in operating items vary period to period due to  among other factors  the timing of research and development activities  such as the preparation and initiation of preclinical trials 
investing activities during and  we purchased  and  respectively  of property  equipment  and building and leasehold improvements 
in addition  during and  we entered into capital lease obligations for assets with aggregate book values of  and  respectively 
the facility improvement project described below contributed significantly to our capital expenditures during and we entered into a lease agreement in for a  square foot building  which we intended to convert into laboratory and office space 
later in  we suspended plans to complete these renovations 
in november  we reinitiated renovation activities on approximately  square feet of the facility  leaving approximately  square feet available for future expansion 
in april  we occupied the facility and began amortizing the cost of the improvements 
we expended approximately  for this project  of which  and  were expended in and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we entered into agreements with a bank for the purpose of funding these improvements 
see financing activities debt financing activities term loan from bank and industrial development authority bonds in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k for a description of the material features of this borrowing 
in addition  pursuant to the lease  we received  from the landlord in september as a partial reimbursement for improvements we made to the facility 
this landlord incentive  which is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet  is being amortized ratably as a reduction to rental expense over the lease term 
in  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we may finance some or all of these capital expenditures through capital leases or the issuance of new debt or equity 
we would prefer to finance capital expenditures through the issuance of new debt  to the extent that we are allowed to do so under our existing bank covenants 
the terms of new debt could require us to maintain a minimum cash and investments balance  or to transfer cash into an escrow account to collateralize some portion of the debt  or both 
financing activities equity financing activities in february  we offered and sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately  in may  we sold  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a number of institutional and individual investors  including  shares sold to officers and an investment fund affiliated with a director  at a price of per share  generating net proceeds of  during  participating employees purchased  shares of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in net proceeds of  in addition  we received proceeds of  upon the exercise of options to purchase  shares of common stock 
in september  we sold  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a number of institutional and individual investors  generating net proceeds of  in february  we sold  shares of common stock in a private placement to a number of institutional and individual investors  generating net proceeds of  in addition  employees purchased  shares of common stock during pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in net proceeds of  during  we received proceeds of  upon the exercise of options to purchase  shares of common stock 
debt financing activities our total debt increased by  to  at december   compared to  at december  this increase primarily resulted from  in proceeds from the issuance of debt during partially offsetting the debt proceeds were  of debt principal repayments during in addition  we entered into a capital lease obligation during for equipment with an aggregate book value of term loan from bank and industrial development authority bonds during the first quarter of  we and a bank entered into agreements under which the bank acquired and reissued the  outstanding of our tax exempt industrial development authority bonds 
in addition  we borrowed  from the bank  of which  was combined with  of our restricted cash for the purpose of paying in full the  outstanding of our taxable industrial development authority bonds 
the remaining  borrowed funded improvements to our leased facility  which we occupied in april  in horsham  pa 
during  we will be required to make principal payments totaling  under these agreements 
the interest rate on the bond and bank debt will vary quarterly  depending on day libor rates 
at december   the day libor was 
we have the option each quarter to incur interest on the outstanding principal at the libor based variable interest rate or a fixed rate offered by our bank 
for the  term loan  interest will accrue at an interest rate equal to the day libor plus 
we will make quarterly  interest only payments through march  commencing on march   we will make quarterly principal payments of  plus interest over the remaining nine years of the ten year loan period 
for the  industrial development authority bond  we will make quarterly  interest only payments for ten years at an interest rate equal to the day libor plus  followed by a single repayment of principal at the end of the ten year loan period 
if the day libor at the beginning of any calendar quarter is between and  the bond will bear interest at the day libor plus 
if the day libor at the beginning of any calendar quarter exceeds  the bond will bear interest at the day libor plus 
to provide security for these borrowings  we granted a first mortgage to our bank on the land and building where our present headquarters are located  as well as a security interest of first priority on certain improvements  certain equipment  and other tangible personal property 
under our agreements with the bank  if the bank determines a material adverse change has occurred in our business  financial condition  results of operations  or business prospects  the bank in its sole discretion may declare at any time an event of default  of which one potential outcome could be the accelerated repayment of the loan balance  which was  as of december  under our agreements with the bank  we agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to  as of december   our total outstanding debt was  at any time after january   or if we fail to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least  our bank has the option to require additional collateral from us in the form of a security interest in certain cash and short term investments  or in the form of a letter of credit  which may have the effect of requiring us to repay the outstanding loan balance to the bank 
the agreements with our bank also contain covenants that  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the bank prior to paying dividends  making certain investments  changing the nature of our business  assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual  selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets  and merging or consolidating with another entity 
term loan from landlord in may  we borrowed  from the landlord of our leased facilities in horsham  pennsylvania 
the terms of the financing require us to pay monthly principal and interest payments over months at an interest rate of 
during  we will be required to make principal and interest payments totaling  under this agreement 
equipment loans we borrowed   and  during   and  respectively  from an equipment lender to finance the purchase of equipment and facility improvements  which collateralize the amounts borrowed 
the terms of the financings require us to make monthly principal and interest payments through january at interest rates ranging from to 
during  we will make principal and interest payments totaling  under these agreements 
capital lease obligations during   and  we entered into capital lease obligations for equipment with a value of   and  respectively 
the terms of the leases require us to make monthly payments through february under these agreements  we will be required to make principal and interest payments totaling  during operating leases we lease laboratory  office  warehouse facilities  and equipment under operating lease agreements 
in april  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in california 
the initial term of the lease ends in march  at which time we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years under certain circumstances 
we lease approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in pennsylvania under a lease agreement that expires april in february  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in pennsylvania 
the initial term of the lease ends in july  at which time we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years  followed by another option to extend the lease for an additional four and one half years 
pursuant to the lease  we received  from the landlord in september as a partial reimbursement for improvements we made to the facility 
this landlord incentive  which is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet  is being amortized ratably as a reduction to rental expense over the lease term 
our laboratory  office  and warehouse facility leases contain escalation clauses  under which the base rent increases annually by 
our rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a focuses on our liquidity  capital resources  and financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed and adjusted periodically by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements included in item of this form k 
management considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a 
revenue recognition our revenue from collaborative agreements consists of upfront fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments 
we recognize revenues consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab was issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  and updates the guidance from staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
non refundable upfront fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but the actual performance period may vary 
we adjust the performance periods based on available facts and circumstances 
our estimate of the performance period is a critical accounting estimate because the accounting estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because the estimate depends on preclinical and clinical progress  and a change in the expected performance period could have a material impact on the deferred revenue reported on our balance sheet as well as our net loss 
periodic payments for research and development activities are recognized over the period that we perform those activities under the terms of each agreement 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based on the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
in november  we entered into two research  development and license agreements with novo nordisk a s to use our glycoadvance and glycopegylation technologies to develop three next generation proteins within novo nordisk s therapeutic areas  one of which is currently marketed by them 
under the terms of the new agreements  we received a non refundable  upfront fee of  which is being amortized to revenue over the expected performance period 
in november  we amended our agreements with novo nordisk to provide an amended work plan for one of the proteins  a method of applying some of the project related funds to tasks that are mutually agreed upon by the parties  a change in the timing of one milestone payment  and the addition of a new milestone payment 
we also received from novo nordisk a payment  which is being amortized to revenue over the expected remaining performance period 
as a result of entering into the amendments in november  we changed our estimate of the expected performance period from five years to six years 
we will also receive up to  in milestone payments based on the progress of the programs 
novo nordisk is responsible for funding our research and development activities under the agreements  and we will receive royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the agreements 
in addition  we could receive additional milestones and royalties on new indications for the two proteins not currently marketed by novo nordisk 
in april  we entered into an agreement with biogenerix to use our proprietary glycoadvance and glycopegylation technologies to develop a long acting  next generation version of granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf 
in connection with the agreement  we received from biogenerix a non refundable  upfront fee  which is being amortized to revenue over the expected performance period of years 
under the agreement  we and biogenerix will pursue development and commercialization of a long acting version of g csf 
the parties will share equally preclinical expenses 
because we do not know which party will incur greater preclinical expenses during any given quarter  we cannot estimate whether biogenerix will be reimbursing us or whether we will be reimbursing biogenerix during each quarter of the preclinical phase 
biogenerix will fund the entire clinical development program 
if we and biogenerix proceed to commercialization  we will have commercial rights in the us  canada  mexico and japan 
biogenerix will have commercial rights in europe and the rest of the world 
each company will receive royalties on product sales in the other company s territory 
stock based employee compensation we apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for all stock based employee compensation 
we record deferred compensation for option grants to employees for the amount  if any  by which the market price per share exceeds the exercise price per share 
we amortize deferred compensation over the vesting periods of each option 
we have elected to adopt only the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the following table illustrates the effect on our net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share if we had recorded compensation expense for the estimated fair value of our stock based employee compensation  consistent with sfas no 
in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net loss as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards net loss pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share as reported basic and diluted net loss per share pro forma valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
our history of negative operating cash flows is an indicator of impairment 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s long lived asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the recognized impairment would be calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
our property and equipment  which had a carrying value of million as of december   have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
of this amount  approximately million represents the carrying value of facility improvements placed in service during the years ended december    and during the year ended december   we decided to sell idle equipment that had a carrying value of  we expect to sell the idle equipment during because the carrying value exceeded the realizable value  net of selling costs  we recognized an impairment loss during of  which is included in research and development expenses on our statements of operations 
the remaining carrying value of  has been reclassified as assets held for sale  and is included in accounts receivable and other current assets on our balance sheets 
we believe the adjusted carrying value of the impaired property and equipment does not exceed its fair value as of december  results of operations years ended december  and and outlook for our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to and provides our estimate of trends for for each component 
revenue from collaborative agreements 
our revenues from collaborative agreements have historically been derived from a few major collaborators 
our collaborative agreements provide for some or all of the following elements upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone revenues  and royalties on product sales 
revenues from collaborative agreements increased to  in from  in  primarily due to research and development funding under our collaborations with novo nordisk and biogenerix 
during the years ended december  and  one customer accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues 
another customer accounted for of our revenues during a third customer accounted for of our revenues in a fourth customer accounted for and of total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 
material cash inflows from proprietary drug development projects are highly uncertain  and we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our major research and development projects 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including entering into collaborative agreements  the achievement of certain milestones  and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by the levels of effort committed and made by our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may discontinue development  may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  or they may not successfully market potential products 
research and development expense 
our proprietary drug development portfolio consists of two therapeutic protein candidates ne and glycopeg gcsf 
epo is prescribed to stimulate production of red blood cells  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia and anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
based on early preclinical studies  we believe it is feasible to develop a long acting epo through glycopegylation 
we expect to complete various preclinical activities for ne  including having a pre ind meeting with the fda and submitting an ind to the fda during the second quarter of our goal is to initiate clinical trials during the third quarter of we expect that data from these trials will be included in data submitted to the appropriate government agencies for regulatory approval 
g csf is prescribed to stimulate production of neutrophils a type of white blood cell  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of neutropenia associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
based on proof of concept data and preclinical development activities conducted during  we believe it is feasible to develop a long acting g csf through glycopegylation 
we and biogenerix plan to complete preclinical development activities for glycopeg gcsf prior to the end of  including requesting scientific advice from regulatory authorities in the eu and submitting the equivalent of an ind in an eu country 
we conduct exploratory research  both independently and with collaborators  on therapeutic candidates  primarily proteins  for development using our enzymatic technologies 
successful candidates may be advanced for development through our own proprietary drug program or through our partnering and licensing program  or a combination of the two 
although our primary focus is the development of long acting proteins  we are also conducting research to assess opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in other areas  such as glycopeptides and glycolipids 
we expect to continue this research during our current research and development projects are divided between two categories i glycoadvance and glycopegylation and ii other glycotechnology programs  which includes projects investigating other applications of our intellectual property 
we are exploring the most cost effective means of continuing some of the projects classified as other glycotechnology programs 
the following chart sets forth our projects in each of these categories and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status glycoadvance and glycopegylation improved erythropoietin preclinical active improved granulocyte colony stimulating factor preclinical active other protein projects research active other glycotechnology programs non protein therapeutic applications research active nutritional applications n a evaluating outlicensing opportunities the process of bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase i  phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials to fda approval is time consuming and expensive 
because our announced product candidates are currently in the preclinical stage and there are a variety of potential intermediate clinical and non clinical outcomes that are inherent in drug development  we cannot reasonably estimate either the timing or costs we will incur to complete these research and development projects 
in addition  the timing and costs to complete our research and development projects will be affected by the timing and nature of any collaboration agreements we may enter into with a third party  neither of which we can currently estimate 
for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials  and supplies for each project 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and preclinical development costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property  and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 
our research and development expenses increased from  in to  in we expect our research and development expenses to be greater in than they were in  as a result of the development  preclinical and clinical activities we plan to conduct during the year 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands 
year ended december  glycoadvance and glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses glycoadvance and glycopegylation our glycoadvance and glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased preclinical development costs associated with ne and glycopeg gcsf  purchases of laboratory services and research supplies  including proteins  and the reallocation of resources from our other glycotechnology programs 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs decreased during  compared to  consistent with our focus on our glycoadvance and glycopegylation programs 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increases related to depreciation of the leasehold improvements at a facility that we occupied in april  as well as the costs associated with operating this facility 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the corresponding period in the period contained higher patent legal expenses than the comparable period 
during  excluding the effect of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
r  we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase by less than over other income and expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  relating to our investment in series a convertible preferred stock of neuronyx  inc we recorded the equity investment  which was made in  at cost 
in october  neuronyx informed us they were nearing completion of a series c equity financing  under which series c and series b neuronyx investors would have an aggregate liquidation preference that is senior to the series a liquidation preference and exceeds the assumed post money valuation of neuronyx 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment to zero as of september  by recording the non cash impairment charge 
we did not record any impairment charges during interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the increase was due to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances  as well as slightly higher interest rates  during our interest income during is difficult to project  and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates and whether we enter into any new collaborative agreements and complete any additional equity or debt financings during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in  primarily due to higher average debt outstanding during the increase was partly offset by the capitalization of more interest expense during than during and  we capitalized  and  respectively  of interest expense associated with leasehold improvements which we placed in service in april our interest expense during is difficult to project and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates and whether we enter into any new debt agreements

years ended december  and our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to revenue from collaborative agreements 
revenues from collaborative agreements decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to the termination in september of our collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals 
the decrease was partly offset by the revenues recorded in under our agreements with novo nordisk 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands 
year ended december  glycoadvance and glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses glycoadvance and glycopegylation our glycoadvance and glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased preclinical development costs associated with our proprietary ne  purchases of laboratory services and research supplies  including proteins  and the reallocation of resources from our other glycotechnology programs 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs decreased during  compared to  consistent with our decision during to focus our resources on our glycoadvance and glycopegylation programs 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increases related to depreciation of pilot manufacturing facility improvements  which were placed in service in january  additional personnel  and the purchase of more supplies and outside services than in substantially offsetting these increases was a reduction in severance expense during of  of which  was a non cash charge  related to an agreement entered into during the first quarter of with one of our former executive officers 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the corresponding period in the period contained higher consulting expenses and costs associated with executive recruitment and relocation than the comparable period 
the decreases in those expenses during were partly offset by increases in payroll 
other income and expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  relating to our investment in series a convertible preferred stock of neuronyx  inc we recorded the equity investment  which was made in  at cost 
in october  neuronyx informed us they were nearing completion of a series c equity financing  under which series c and series b neuronyx investors would have an aggregate liquidation preference that is senior to the series a liquidation preference and exceeds the assumed post money valuation of neuronyx 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment to zero as of september  by recording the non cash impairment charge 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of other income upon receipt from genzyme general of a contract payment  which was due as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with novazyme pharmaceuticals  inc in march in september  genzyme acquired novazyme  and assumed novazyme s contractual obligation to us 
we did not recognize any other income during interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  as well as lower interest rates  during interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to zero for the corresponding period in in  we capitalized  of interest expense on two facility improvement projects 
in accordance with gaap  we recognized capitalized interest for these projects only to the extent of our actual interest expense  resulting in no reported interest expense for recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires companies to expense the fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation to employees 
it also provides guidance for determining whether an award is a liability classified award or an equity classified award  and determining fair value 
sfas no 
r will be effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after june   and applies to all unvested stock based payment awards outstanding as of the adoption date 
we have not completed an assessment of the impact on our financial statements resulting from potential modifications to our equity based compensation structure or the use of an alternative fair value model in anticipation of adopting sfas no 
r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas no 
 which requires a nonmonetary exchange of assets be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gain or loss  if the exchange meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable 
the commercial substance criterion is assessed by comparing the entity s expected cash flows immediately before and after the exchange 
this eliminates the similar productive assets exception  which accounts for the exchange of assets at book value with no recognition of gain or loss 
sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
factors affecting the company s prospects financial risks if we fail to obtain necessary funds for our operations  we will be unable to maintain and improve our technology position and we will be unable to develop and commercialize our therapeutic proteins 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the public and private placements of equity securities 
we have also funded our operations to a lesser extent from proceeds from property and equipment financing  interest earned on investments  revenues from corporate collaborations and gains from the sale of investments 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our february public offering of common stock  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through mid  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may affect the rate at which we deplete our cash and cash equivalents 
our present and future capital requirements depend on many factors  including level of research and development investment required to develop our therapeutic proteins  and maintain and improve our technology position  the costs of obtaining or manufacturing proteins and reagents for research and development and at commercial scale  the results of preclinical and clinical testing  which can be unpredictable in drug development  changes in product candidate development plans needed to address any difficulties that may arise in manufacturing  preclinical activities  clinical studies or commercialization  our ability and willingness to enter into new agreements with collaborators and to extend or maintain our existing collaborations  and the terms of these agreements  our success rate and that of our collaborators in preclinical and clinical efforts associated with milestones and royalties  the costs of investigating patents that might block us from developing potential drug candidates  the costs of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the timing  willingness  and ability of our collaborators to commercialize products incorporating our technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and our need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or new drug targets 
we will require significant amounts of additional capital in the future  and we do not have any assurance that funding will be available when we need it on terms that we find favorable  if at all 
we may seek to raise these funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  credit facilities  or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders percentage ownership will be reduced and they may experience substantial dilution 
we may also issue equity securities that provide for rights  preference and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of opportunities  develop products and technologies  and otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited  and we may need to downsize or halt our operations 
our debt obligations include restrictive covenants which may restrict our operations or otherwise adversely affect us 
we entered into a credit agreement with a bank  dated as of january   under which the outstanding balance  as of december   was million 
under the credit agreement  we agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to million  therefore  we cannot exceed this limit without the bank s consent 
as of december   our total outstanding debt was million 
the limit on our total debt under the credit agreement could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry 
under our credit agreement  if the bank determines a material adverse change has occurred in our business  financial condition  results of operations  or business prospects  the bank  in its sole discretion  may declare at any time an event of default  of which one potential outcome could be the accelerated repayment of the then outstanding loan balance under the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million  or at any time after january   the bank has the option to require additional collateral from us in the form of a security interest in certain cash and short term investments  or in the form of a letter of credit  which may have the effect of requiring us to repay the then outstanding loan balance under the credit agreement 
as of december   we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of million 
the credit agreement also contains covenants that  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the bank prior to paying dividends  making certain investments  changing the nature of our business  assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual  selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets  or merging or consolidating with another entity 
a breach of any of the financial tests or other covenants in the credit agreement could result in a default under our credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the bank could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable  and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
we have a history of losses  and we may incur continued losses for some time 
we have incurred losses each year of our existence  including net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  given our planned level of operating expenses  we expect to continue incurring losses for some time 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenue from corporate collaborations  license agreements  and investments 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from these sources and from the licensing of our technologies 
we also expect to spend significant amounts to expand our research and development on our proprietary drug candidates and technologies  maintain and expand our intellectual property position  expand our manufacturing scale up activities  and expand our business development and commercialization efforts 
our level of operating expenditures will vary depending upon the stage of development of our proprietary proteins and the number and nature of our collaborations 
we may continue to incur substantial losses even if our revenues increase 
we have not yet commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never become profitable 
we have not yet commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never be able to do so 
since we began operations in  we have not generated any revenues  except from corporate collaborations  license agreements  and investments 
we do not know when or if we will complete any of our product development efforts  obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates incorporating our technologies  or successfully commercialize any approved products 
even if we are successful in developing products that are approved for marketing  we will not be successful unless these products gain market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors  including the timing of regulatory approvals in the countries  and for the uses  we seek  the competitive environment  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products  the adequacy and success of distribution  sales and marketing efforts  and the pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products or products incorporating our technologies 
as a result  we are unable to predict the extent of future losses or the time required to achieve profitability  if at all 
even if we or our collaborators successfully develop one or more products that incorporate our technologies  we may not become profitable 
risks related to development of products and technologies we may be unable to develop next generation therapeutic proteins 
we are seeking to use our enzymatic technologies to develop proprietary next generation proteins  generally in collaboration with a partner 
the development of protein drugs involves a range of special challenges at various stages of the process 
in the preclinical phase of product development  we and our partners will face several potential problems  including producing or obtaining supplies of the protein on commercially reasonable terms  successfully modifying the protein using our enzymatic technologies  and achieving adequate yields of the next generation protein 
even if a protein development program appears to be proceeding well in the early phases  a product candidate may fail in clinical trials for several reasons  such as results indicating that the product candidate is less effective than desired eg  the trial failed to meet its primary objectives or that it has harmful or problematic side effects 
if clinical trials are successful  it is possible that problems may arise later during commercialization 
for example  we are aware that one marketed epo product of a competitor was associated with pure red cell aplasia in post marketing surveillance studies 
this highlights the fact that even after a product is approved for marketing  problems may arise which can negatively affect sales and increase costs 
our failure to solve any of these problems could delay or prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies and could negatively impact our business 
proteins are uniquely susceptible to neutralizing antibodies that could result in diminished efficacy of our products 
proteins that are foreign to a living body often provoke an immune response 
protein drugs produced by recombinant technology  even though they have the same primary amino acid sequence as a native human protein  sometimes provoke formation of antibodies that bind to the protein drug 
some such antibodies bind so as to prevent the protein drug from engaging its receptor  and thus neutralize the drug activity of the protein 
furthermore  neutralizing antibodies provoked by administration of a protein drug may react with endogenous proteins whose natural activity the drug was intended to supplement  thereby inducing a total lack of the intended activity in the patient 
such a condition can prove fatal 
we will not know if the proteins we develop as product candidates will provoke neutralizing antibody responses in humans until they are evaluated in clinical trials 
it is possible that our product candidates may be rendered ineffective for the therapeutic purpose for which they are intended or could induce harm to patients because of the neutralizing effect of antibodies created in humans in response to our proteins 
additionally  all protein drugs expressed by recombinant technology retain some trace of contaminating proteins from the host cells used to express the protein drug 
these host cell proteins may increase the chances of an immunogenic response that could diminish the therapeutic efficacy of the protein 
our glycoadvance technology enables the use of protein drugs produced in insect cells  an expression system which has certain technical advantages in enabling the application of our technology to this protein  but for which no product to date has received marketing authorization in the us or eu 
it is possible that our product candidates may be rendered ineffective for the therapeutic purpose for which they are intended because of the neutralizing effects of antibodies provoked by the presence of trace amounts of insect cell proteins in our drug preparations 
we have limited product development and commercial manufacturing experience  and face challenges unique to proteins 
to date  we have not manufactured  at commercial scale  any pharmaceutically active proteins nor the enzymes  sugar nucleotides or other reagents we use to modify proteins 
we face the significant  normal scale up risks associated with protein manufacturing proteins are difficult to produce  it is difficult to scale up protein manufacturing processes  and it is expensive to produce proteins 
we also face special risks in connection with the epo protein that we are currently manufacturing to support preclinical and early clinical development of ne our success with this program will depend on our ability to manufacture this protein  at commercial scale  in the insect cell expression system the production source of ne  either independently or with a collaborator or supplier 
we do not know if we will be able to locate a contract manufacturer outside of the us that will be able to manufacture this protein at commercial scale and on economically feasible terms 
to date  no product produced in this expression system has received marketing authorization in the us or the eu  which means that we may face previously unidentified problems resulting from the use of this expression system and related regulatory challenges 
we are also manufacturing  directly or through suppliers  the enzymes  sugar nucleotides and other reagents we need to apply our technologies 
we have sought and continue to have collaborators  licensees or contract manufacturers manufacture at least some of the compounds necessary to commercialize our technologies 
we may not be able to find parties willing and able to manufacture these compounds at acceptable prices  and we may become dependent on suppliers that could discontinue our supply arrangements or change supply terms to our disadvantage 
our success depends on our ability to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale or to obtain commercial quantities  in either case  at reasonable cost 
our manufacturing processes also must comply with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  prescribed by the fda 
we may not be able to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of the products we develop to meet our needs for pre clinical or clinical development  and we may have problems complying  or maintaining compliance  with cgmp 
any manufacturing facility must adhere to the fda s evolving regulations on cgmp  which are enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
the manufacture of products at any facility will be subject to strict quality control  testing  and record keeping requirements  and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post market information 
ultimately  we or our contract manufacturers may not meet these requirements 
if we encounter delays or difficulties in connection with manufacturing  commercialization of our products and technologies could be delayed  and we could breach our obligations under our collaborative agreements and we may have difficulty obtaining necessary financing 
our success depends on the success of our collaborative relationships and the success of our collaborators 
we plan to rely to a large extent on collaborative partners to co develop our products and to commercialize products made using our technologies 
we currently have collaborative agreements with novo nordisk  biogenerix and macrogenics 
we anticipate that substantially all of our revenues during the next several years will continue to be generated from collaboration or license agreements 
our partnering strategy entails many risks  including we may be unsuccessful in entering into or maintaining collaborative agreements for the co development of our products or the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies  we may not be successful in applying our technologies to the needs of our collaborative partners  our collaborators may not be successful in  or may not remain committed to  co developing our products or commercializing products incorporating our technologies  our collaborators may seek to develop other proprietary alternatives to our products or technologies  our collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to incorporating our technologies into their products  our collaborators are not obligated to market or commercialize our products or products incorporating our technologies  and they are not required to achieve any specific commercialization schedule  our collaborative agreements may be terminated by our partners on short notice  and continued consolidation in our target markets may limit our ability to enter into collaboration agreements  or may result in terminations of existing collaborations 
given these risks  there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts 
the use in humans of compounds developed by us or incorporating our technologies may result in product liability claims 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend  and may result in large settlements of claims or judgments against us 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity  time  and expense involved in defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
we may be exposed to product liability and related risks 
the use in humans of compounds developed by us or incorporating our technologies may result in product liability claims 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend  and may result in large settlements of claims or judgments against us 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity  time  and expense involved in defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
risks related to intellectual property blocking patents or claims of infringement may stop or delay or development of our proprietary products 
our commercial success depends in part on avoiding claims of infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
as we seek to develop next generation proprietary products  we devote significant resources to investigating the patent protection surrounding our target proteins 
patent protection for therapeutic proteins often comprises numerous claims for composition of matter  methods of use  and methods of making 
the numerous patents may be difficult to uncover and interpret  leading to uncertainty about our freedom to operate 
it is possible that we will not be aware of issued patents or pending patent applications that are relevant to our product candidates because our searches do not find them  or pending patent applications because they are not yet publicly available 
our interpretation of patents could be challenged  leading to litigation  and we could face claims of infringement of rights of which we are unaware 
we rely on certain exemptions and safe harbors in order to conduct the necessary research and development to support our regulatory filings 
the supreme court of the united states has recently agreed to hear a case related to a particular safe harbor upon which we rely in the us the elements of this safe harbor could be modified by the supreme court in a manner that is adverse to us  causing an increase in challenges or claims of infringement against us in relation to the patents of third parties and the possibility of our products being blocked from development in the us there have been significant litigation and interference proceedings regarding patent rights  and the patent situation regarding particular products is often complex and uncertain 
for example  with respect to epo  the target of our first development program  the status of issued patents is currently being litigated by others and these patents could delay our ability to market a long acting epo in the us as we proceed with this program and other targets  we may face uncertainty and litigation could result  which could lead to liability for damages  prevent our development and commercialization efforts  and divert resources from our business strategy 
the cost of any litigation challenging our right to pursue our target proteins or technologies could be substantial 
others seeking to develop next generation versions of proteins  or the holders of patents on our target proteins  may have greater financial resources  making them better able to bear the cost of litigation 
in particular  one company that produces products that will likely be in direct competition with our current product candidates has aggressively defended the patents related to its products and this could increase the likelihood of litigation or the cost of litigation 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and market products  form strategic alliances  and compete in the marketplace 
third parties from time to time may assert that we are infringing their patents  trade secrets or know how  although we believe our product candidates do not infringe the products  trade secrets or know how of third parties 
in addition  patents may issue in the future to third parties that our technology may infringe 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability or our partners ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products or technologies in the us and abroad  and could result in the award of substantial damages 
if we are found to infringe  we may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be unable to proceed 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could have a material adverse effect on us 
the failure to obtain  maintain or protect patents and other intellectual property could impact our ability to compete effectively 
to compete effectively  we need to develop and maintain a proprietary position with regard to our own technologies  products and business 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in our technology field are still evolving 
therefore  the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights in our core technologies and products made using these technologies is also uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  we may be subject to interference proceedings  we may be subject to opposition proceedings in foreign countries  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection  we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our customers may not provide a competitive advantage  other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our customers  other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  or duplicate our technologies  other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed  and enforcement of patents is complex  uncertain and expensive 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any of our pending applications  and we cannot be certain that any of our issued patents will give us adequate protection from competing products 
for example  issued patents may be circumvented or challenged  declared invalid or unenforceable  or narrowed in scope 
in addition  since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions 
in the event that another party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention claimed by us  we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial uncertainties and costs for us  even if the eventual outcome were favorable to us 
it is also possible that others may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business 
as to those patents that we have licensed  our rights depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement  and we may be unable to do so 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding relating to our patents or applications  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
our ability to enforce our patent protection could be limited by our financial resources  and may be subject to lengthy delays 
if we are unable to effectively enforce our proprietary rights  or if we are found to infringe the rights of others  we may be in breach of our license agreements with our partners 
in addition to patents and patent applications  we depend upon trade secrets and proprietary know how to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees  consultants  advisors  and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties 
we require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas  developments  discoveries  and inventions 
these agreements may not  however  provide adequate protection for our trade secrets  know how  or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure 
international patent protection is uncertain 
in addition to the issues discussed under the two preceding risks  patent law outside the us differs from country to country 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of foreign patents belonging to us or our competitors  which proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
finally  some of our patent protection in the us is not available to us in foreign countries due to the differences in the patent laws of those countries 
we may have to develop or license alternative technologies if we are unable to maintain or obtain key technology from third parties 
we have licensed patents and patent applications from a number of institutions 
some of our proprietary rights have been licensed to us under agreements that have performance requirements or other contingencies 
the failure to comply with these provisions could lead to termination or modifications of our rights to these licenses 
additionally  we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base 
the ownership of patents exclusively licensed to us may be subject to challenge if inventorship was not adequately investigated and represented 
if our existing licenses are terminated or if we are unable to obtain such additional licenses on acceptable terms  our ability to perform our own research and development and to comply with our obligations under our collaborative agreements may be delayed while we seek to develop or license alternative technologies 
risks related to competition our competitors may develop better or more successful products 
our business is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
new developments in molecular biology  medicinal chemistry and other fields of biology and chemistry are expected to continue at a rapid pace in both industry and academia 
our potential competitors include both public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations that are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection 
a number of these competitors are working on the development of next generation protein therapeutics 
some of these competitors include maxygen  nektar therapeutics  enzon pharmaceuticals  human genome sciences and alkermes 
other companies have programs focused on developing next generation or improved versions of epo and g csf  and some are already marketing improved versions of these products 
these companies include amgen  roche  transkaryotic therapeutics  human genome sciences  maxygen  ariad pharmaceuticals and affymax 
other companies are active in this area  and we expect that competition will increase 
we are also aware that there are several companies engaged in glycobiology research 
in addition  we may compete with companies commercializing first generation protein therapeutics  as a result of pricing practices or reimbursement limitations 
even if we succeed in developing and marketing products that have significant advantages over first generation products  if first generation products are available at a lower out of pocket cost to the consumer  health care providers and consumers may choose first generation products instead of next generation versions 
compared to us  many of our likely and potential competitors have more financial  scientific and technical resources  product development  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  experience conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of new products  and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for products 
competitors may succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective or less costly than ours and that would render our products or technologies  or both  obsolete or noncompetitive 
we know that other companies with substantial resources are working on the development of next generation proteins  and they may achieve better results in enzymatically modifying our target proteins or the target proteins of our potential collaborators 
competitors also may prove to be more successful in designing  manufacturing and marketing products 
if we are successful in developing our own drug candidates or versions of drugs that are no longer patented  we will compete with other drug manufacturers for market share 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our commercial opportunities will be diminished 
in addition  while there is no abbreviated regulatory pathway for follow on biologics  this possibility is under discussion in the us and other jurisdictions 
if an abbreviated regulatory process is adopted for the approval of follow on biologics in any major market  competition could increase in related segments of the therapeutic protein market 
we may be unable to retain key employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel  including our research and development team and our president  ceo and chairman  c 
boyd clarke 
the advancement of our business is dependent upon our management team s ability to evaluate collaboration opportunities and on our ceo s ability to focus the company s efforts 
our anticipated research and development efforts will require additional expertise and the addition of new qualified personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified management and research and development personnel in the pharmaceutical field 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for our business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  could harm our research and development programs  our ability to manage day to day operations  attract collaboration partners  attract and retain other employees  and generate revenues 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
risks related to government regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation  and we or our collaborators may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals or may encounter long delays and large expenditures in obtaining such approvals 
the research  development  manufacture and control  marketing  and sale of our reagents and product candidates manufactured using our technologies are subject to significant  but varying  degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the us and other countries 
pharmaceutical product candidates manufactured using our technologies must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process before commercialization 
this process is regulated by the fda and by comparable agencies in the eu and in other countries 
the us and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  and mandate product withdrawals 
we and our collaborators intend to base our submissions for regulatory approval and the information contained in such submissions on our understanding of the requirements of the fda and its foreign counterparts 
if additional information is required  we may face delays and additional costs 
the specific risks of protein drugs may result in the application of more stringent regulatory requirements prior to approval of our product candidates 
we face special challenges in connection with the development of proteins produced in the insect cell expression system 
to our knowledge  no compound for human use produced in this expression system has been submitted for marketing authorization in the us or eu  and we may encounter long delays and large expenditures or other regulatory hurdles in connection with the approval process for a product produced in this expression system 
neither we nor our collaborators have submitted any product candidates incorporating our technologies for approval to the fda or any other regulatory authority 
if any product candidate manufactured using our technology is submitted for regulatory approval  it may not receive the approvals necessary for commercialization  the desired labeling claims  or adequate levels of reimbursement 
any delay in receiving  or failure to receive  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to generate product revenues or royalties  and we will have already spent significant sums in pursuing approval 
we anticipate that the development of our next generation proprietary proteins will involve a traditional development program  including clinical trials 
any new governmental regulations may delay or alter regulatory approval of any product candidate manufactured using our technology 
if an abbreviated regulatory process is adopted for the approval of follow on biologics in any major market  competition could increase in related segments of the therapeutic protein market 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental action that might arise from future legislative and administrative action 
even if we or our collaborators are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  our or their manufacturing processes would be subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
any later discovery of unknown problems with our products  products incorporating our technologies  or manufacturing processes could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  including potential withdrawal of the products from the market 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we or our collaborators have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate or the manufacture and control of our reagents  then we or our collaborators may not obtain necessary approvals to market and sell the product candidate 
third party reimbursement for our collaborators or our future product candidates may not be adequate 
even if regulatory approval is obtained to sell any product candidates incorporating our technologies  our future revenues  profitability  and access to capital will be determined in part by the price at which we or our collaborators can sell such products 
there are continuing efforts by governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect a number of federal  state  and foreign proposals to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any health care reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign  and private payors may take in response to the proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
our and our collaborators ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the us  private health insurers  and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product research and development 
inadequate coverage and reimbursement levels provided by government and third party payors for use of our or our collaborators products may cause these products to fail to achieve market acceptance and would cause us to lose anticipated revenues and delay achievement of profitability 
it is possible that reimbursement may be limited to that which is available for first generation versions of one or more of our or our collaborator s products  making it harder for us and our collaborators to realize an appropriate return 
risks related to facilities  business interruption  and the environment the use of hazardous materials in our operations may subject us to environmental claims or liability 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  and radioactive compounds 
we conduct experiments that are quite common in the biotechnology industry  in which we use small quantities of corrosive  toxic and flammable chemicals  and trace amounts of radioactive materials 
the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
we do not maintain a separate insurance policy for these types of risks 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our resources 
we are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant 
destructive actions by activists or terrorists could damage our facilities  interfere with our research activities  and cause ecological harm 
activists and terrorists have shown a willingness to injure people and damage physical facilities  equipment and biological materials to publicize or otherwise further their ideological causes 
our or our collaborators operations and research activities  and services conducted for us by third parties  could be adversely affected by such acts 
any such damage could delay our research projects and decrease our ability to conduct future research and development 
damage caused by activist or terrorist incidents could also cause the release of hazardous materials  including chemicals  radioactive and biological materials 
any significant interruption to our ability to conduct our business operations  research and development activities  or manufacturing operations could reduce our revenue and increase our expenses 
risks related to stock market our stock price may continue to experience fluctuations 
the market prices of securities of thinly traded biotechnology companies  such as ours  generally are highly volatile 
for example  since march   the price of our common stock reached a high of per share in march and a low of per share in march in this market environment  the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such a sale might occur would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  at least for the short term 
we have a number of investors who hold relatively large positions in our securities 
a decision by any of these investors to sell all or a block of their holdings of our common stock could cause our stock price to drop significantly 
the market also continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  some of which are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
many factors could have a significant effect on the market price for our common stock  including preclinical and clinical trial results  product development delays  regulatory delays  an announcement or termination of a collaborative relationship by us or any of our partners or competitors  developments relating to our patent position or other proprietary rights  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products  government regulations  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others  and general market conditions 
any litigation brought against us as a result of this volatility could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could negatively impact our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  and the price of our common stock 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities in a fluctuating market  many or all of our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution  and if we need to raise capital by issuing equity securities at a time when our stock price is down  we may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to meet our requirements 
if any of the risks described in these factors affecting the company s prospects occurred  of if any unforeseen risk affected our performance  it could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
foreign exchange risks changes in foreign currency exchange rates could result in increased costs 
we have entered into some agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in euros or other foreign currencies  and  in the future  we may enter into additional  significant agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
if the values of these currencies increase against the dollar  our costs would increase 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we are currently not engaged in hedging activities and we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of our interest income and expense to selected changes in market interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations and maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we seek the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in high credit quality institutional money market funds and fixed income securities 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
because our investments are short term in duration  we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant 
we held no marketable securities as of december  the approximate principal amount of our investment portfolio as of december  was approximately  and the weighted average interest rate earned on the portfolio during was and interest income during was  the sensitivity analysis as it relates to our investment activities assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their weighted average levels in a basis point move up or down in market interest rates would have caused a corresponding change of  in interest income for as of december   the principal components of our debt portfolio were a term loan from a bank for  that accrues interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus  tax exempt industrial development authority bonds of  that accrues interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus  a term loan from our landlord of  that accrues interest at a fixed rate of  aggregate equipment financing of  that accrues interest at fixed rates ranging from to and capital lease obligations with a present value of  for which we imputed interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
our aggregate interest expense for was  by modifying the interest expense associated with our variable rate debt  and notes payable entered into during  a basis point move up or down in market interest rates would have caused a corresponding change of  in interest expense for foreign exchange risk we have entered into some agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in euros or other foreign currencies  and  in the future  we may enter into additional  significant agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
if the values of these currencies increase against the dollar  our costs would increase 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results
