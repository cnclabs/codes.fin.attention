item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global provider of software and hardware products and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage their internet traffic 
our products enhance the delivery  optimization and security of application traffic on internet based networks 
we market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in the americas primarily the united states  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  japan and the asia pacific region 
enterprise customers fortune or business week global companies in financial services  transportation  government and telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base 
during the fiscal year  we announced plans to acquire all of the common stock of swan labs  inc for cash of million 
the merger closed on october   subsequent to our year end 
as a result of the transaction  we acquired all the assets of swan labs  including its principal products  wanjet and webaccelerator 
wanjet devices are deployed in data centers and branch offices to speed up file transfers  email  and the performance of any ip based application that runs over a wide area network  or wan 
webaccelerator works in concert with wanjet to speed up the performance of ip based enterprise applications running over wans 
the acquisition of swan labs expands our product line and gives us broader access to the wan optimization and web acceleration markets 
our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
those indicators include revenues 
the majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our core products  big ip local traffic manager  big ip global traffic manager  big ip isp traffic manager  trafficshield application firewall  and firepass ssl vpn servers 
we also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts  installation  training and consulting services 
we carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period 
we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key indicators 
table of contents of future trends 
we also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends 
cost of revenues and gross margins 
we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins 
significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers  third party software license fees  and amortization of developed technology  personnel and overhead expenses 
our margins have remained relatively stable over the past two years  however factors such as sales price  product mix  inventory obsolescence  returns  component price increases  and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent the significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses 
existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends 
other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions  travel  professional fees  computer costs related to the development of new products  facilities and depreciation expenses 
liquidity and cash flows 
our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt 
the increase in cash and investments during the fiscal year was primarily due to net income from operations  with operating activities providing cash of million 
capital expenditures during the fiscal year were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities 
on october   subsequent to our year end  we acquired all of the common stock of swan labs  inc for cash of million 
we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products  or technologies that we believe are strategic  which may require the use of cash 
balance sheet 
we view cash  short term and long term investments  deferred revenue  accounts receivable balances and day s sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health 
deferred revenues continued to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base 
our day s sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal was we expect to maintain this metric in the mid to high s range going forward 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we sell products through distributors  resellers  and directly to end users 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns  revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user 
in this situation  we receive a sales 
table of contents report from the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user has occurred 
payment terms to domestic customers are generally net days 
payment terms to international customers range from net to days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets 
we have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers  in which case  revenue is recognized when payments are made 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support pcs elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price  a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately 
revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse 
revenues for pcs are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term 
pcs includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  a limited period of telephone support  updates  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses  and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 
reserve for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we evaluate historical write offs  current trends in the credit quality of our customer base  as well as changes in the credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and do not require any collateral 
if there is deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 
reserve for product returns 
in some instances  product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return 
product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
accordingly  we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  revenue is recognized when such rights lapse 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns  inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors 
it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 
reserve for warranties 
a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas accordingly  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  fas r on july   and as a result recognized million of expense related to stock based compensation charges included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to july   we accounted for 
table of contents share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
in accordance with apb no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
the results for the prior periods have not been restated 
effective july  we adopted the straight line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense 
previously under the disclosure only provisions of sfas  the company used the accelerated method of expense recognition pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin 
for all unvested options outstanding as of july   the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value at the original grant date  will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period 
for share based payments granted subsequent to july   compensation expense  based on the fair value on the date of grant  will be recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
as of september   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost  the majority of which will be recognized ratably over the next two years 
going forward  stock compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
in addition  the company recently modified the method in which it issues incentive awards to its employees through stock based compensation 
in prior years  stock based compensation consisted only of stock options 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began to grant restricted stock unit awards instead of stock options 
the value of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic value method  which in this case  is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
alternatively  in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions 
expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price  over the expected life of the option 
expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior  the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years 
our stock price volatility and option lives involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal is 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
years ended september  in thousands  except for percentages net revenues products services total percentage of net revenues products services total net revenues 
total net revenues increased in fiscal year from fiscal year  compared to an increase of in fiscal year from fiscal year the improvement was due to increased demand for our application delivery networking products and higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of products 
during fiscal year  each of our primary geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period 
international revenues represented  and of net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues  although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 
net product revenues increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our big ip product line as well as incremental revenues derived from sales of our firepass and trafficshield product lines 
sales of our big ip family of application delivery networking products represented   and of total product revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of total sales was due to an improvement in sales of our other products  such as our firepass products which represented of product revenues in fiscal year net service revenues increased in fiscal year compared to a increase for fiscal year from the prior year  respectively 
the decrease in the growth rate was due to an increase in the amount of support services provided by our channel partners 
the increase of services revenues in absolute dollars was the result of a growing customer base and continued growth in service renewals from existing customers

cost of net product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues remained relatively consistent at in fiscal year as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars is consistent with the increase in product revenues for the corresponding period 
higher indirect product costs including amortization charges of our acquired technology and warranty costs associated with the growth in overall product installation base contributed to the percentage increase as compared to fiscal year cost of net service revenues 
cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff  travel  facilities  and depreciation expenses 
cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues increased to in fiscal year as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount

in absolute dollars  sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to higher commission and personnel costs  consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the corresponding period 
sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal increased to from at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal stock based compensation charges of million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share

other income  net  consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
other income  net  increased in fiscal year and increased in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the significant increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balances 
the increased investment balances are the result of cash provided from operating and financing activities during the fiscal years and fiscal year net proceeds of million received from the sale of common stock in a public offering completed in november of was the most significant addition to our investment balances 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for the fiscal year as of fiscal year end we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized 
in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end  and were million  million and million  respectively 
our world wide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our geographic locations  changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets  resolution of potential exposures  introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
we have recorded liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 
in fiscal year  the primary difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to previously unrecognized deferred tax assets which were recognized 
sfas  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not 
based on available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we had provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year based upon our operating performance in fiscal year and projected future taxable income  we determined that our us deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable 
therefore  the valuation allowance was reversed and as a result we realized an income tax benefit of million 
the credit from the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by actual us and international tax 
table of contents expenses resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal year the provision for income taxes in fiscal year consisted primarily of taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions

years ended september  in thousands liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and investments cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments totaled million as of september  compared to million as of september   representing an increase of million 
the increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option exercises 
in fiscal year  overall cash and investments increased million compared to the fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering completed in november cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income  after adjusting for non cash charges  changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in advance payments from customers

cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for the fiscal year in fiscal years and  our financing activities consisted of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
during the fiscal year  our financing activities included million of net proceeds received from a public stock offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

on september   the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph of eitf and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and the company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in fsp eitf during fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of fsp fas and fas to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features  market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products we expect the application delivery networking market to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes  and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers 
if we are unable to identify  develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
in september  we announced the release of our next generation big ip product featuring the traffic management operating system  or tmos 
this major new version of big ip represented the culmination of over two years of research and development efforts 
tmos is specifically designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery functions as modules that can be added to big ip s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs 
we currently offer software modules as add ons for this product and our continued success depends significantly on our ability to integrate new modules and functionality onto this platform and the acceptance of the new hardware and software platforms associated with this release by our existing and target customers 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products  or replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
we have also experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
also  in the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
in addition  complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the end of life stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses 
any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 
our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our big ip product lines for the fiscal year ended september   we derived of our product revenues from sales of our big ip family of application delivery networking product lines 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our big ip products in the future 
implementation of our strategy depends upon big ip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers 
if big ip is unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in big ip s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market the markets we serve are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include cisco systems  inc  nortel networks corporation  foundry networks  inc  citrix systems  inc  radware ltd 
and juniper networks  inc 
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new 
table of contents participants enter our market 
in addition  larger companies with significant resources  brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions and emerge as significant competitors 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
in particular  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from just one account  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
in the past  a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
accordingly  a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter  or in some cases  that year 
additionally  we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and sub tenants 
although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately 
we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements  seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses 
if there is a deterioration of a sub tenant s or major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future resulting losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
further  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years 
our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase  which may negatively impact gross profits it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  in order to maintain our gross profits  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline  which will harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle our products have a lengthy sales cycle  which is difficult to predict 
historically  our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market 
also  as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model  utilizing value added resellers  distributors and systems integrators  the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions 
sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits 
sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us 
as a result  our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

table of contents our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products 
we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications 
we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past 
however  if we experience major delays in the future or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations 
in particular  because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer  with whom we do not have a long term contract  any termination  loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly  or any impairment of their facilities or operations  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions 
any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue  may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources 
lead times for these components vary significantly 
the unavailability of suitable components  any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components  or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time  may delay assembly and sales of our products and  hence  our revenues  and may harm our business and results of operations 
we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims  we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
in addition  we have initiated  and may in the future initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights  to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors 
any of these claims  whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others  or vice versa  with or without merit  may be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology  develop non infringing 
table of contents technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
further  our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers  distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology  which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers  distributors or resellers 
any of the above described circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 
many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties 
in the future  it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
the inability to obtain certain licenses  or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  we license some third party intellectual property on a non exclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers  systems integrators  internet service providers and other channel partners 
we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
in addition  one domestic distributor of our products accounted for and of our total net revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products 
the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce as our international sales increase  our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks 
these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states  foreign currency exchange rates  managing foreign sales offices  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in specific countries  military conflict or terrorist activities  changes in laws and tariffs  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries  foreign regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we intend to continue expanding into international markets 
international sales represented and of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
in particular  in fiscal 
table of contents year  we derived of our total revenue from the japanese market 
this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control  including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy 
changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including  but not limited to  environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  especially encryption technology 
changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals  permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues  business and operations 
acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of swan labs  present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction with respect to our acquisitions  as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake  we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected  or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth  or that economic conditions change  all of which may generate future impairment charges 
there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business 
we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines 
our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations 
we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations 
we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality  technology and other matters 
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately  effectively and in a timely manner  or to retain key personnel of any acquired business  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology  as well as on our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing  operations  product development and professional services personnel our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and finance personnel  many of whom may be difficult to replace 
the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support  as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort  requires us to retain highly trained professional services  customer support and sales personnel 
competition for qualified professional services  customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock  since these employees are generally granted stock options 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  may harm our business and results of operations 
we face litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
responding to the 
table of contents allegations has been  and will likely continue to be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our bylaws  including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
similarly  state anti takeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities  commercial paper and money market funds  which are exempt from size limitation 
the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less  with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in our interest income for the fiscal year maturing in three months three months greater than or less to one year one year total fair value in thousands  except for percentages september  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rates included in long term investments weighted average interest rates september  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rates included in long term investments weighted average interest rates 
table of contents maturing in three months three months greater than or less to one year one year total fair value in thousands  except for percentages september  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rates included in long term investments weighted average interest rates foreign currency risk 
the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  as we continue to expand our operations internationally  transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
however  we may do so in the future
