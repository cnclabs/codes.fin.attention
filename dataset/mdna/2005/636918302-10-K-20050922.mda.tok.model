nmhc derives its revenue from the provision of comprehensive pharmacy benefit management services to sponsors of prescription benefit plans 
substantially all of the services nmhc provides to its sponsors are related to pharmacy benefit programs and services 
nmhc also recognizes administrative fees and earns rebates at the time of claims adjudication 
revenue for the pbm division is earned and recognized as follows administrative fees are agreed upon with the sponsor on either a per claim charge or a per plan participant per month charge 
per claim fees are billed to sponsors for the claims adjudicated during the period 
per plan participant per month fees are generally billed to sponsors at the end of the month 
the amount of revenue related to the drugs dispensed by pharmacies participating in our pharmacy network is recognized at the time of dispensing the drug as the cost is incurred 
the amount of revenue recognized is reduced by the amount of rebates that we share with our sponsors 
the specific terms of the contracts that we enter into with our sponsors will determine whether we recognize the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain cases  we do not recognize the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on our gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of nmhc s revenues relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed and administrative fees in thousands years ended june  revenues relating to pharmaceuticals    administrative fees and other    total revenues    nmhc does not take possession or legal ownership of the pharmaceuticals dispensed by the retail pharmacy network or its out sourced mail service facilities  although nmhc assumes the legal responsibility and financial risk of paying for dispensed pharmaceuticals whether or not nmhc is paid by its sponsors 
nmhc does take possession and dispenses pharmaceuticals from our mail service facility and specialty pharmacy 
nmhc utilizes its comprehensive pharmacy benefit database to perform outcome studies and to develop disease information programs which are used to reduce overall healthcare costs 
our nmhc integrail division uses its software tools to analyze and predict outcomes for both medical and pharmacy data 
these programs currently produce a small amount of revenue  but are starting to attract interest in the marketplace 
we believe that these value added information based services are becoming a more important component of managed care as well as management of the overall healthcare dollar  and therefore these services may provide an increasing source of revenue for us in the future 
nmhcmail recognizes revenue at the point of shipment for both the co pay collected from the individual member  as well as for the sale of the prescription to the pbm at specified prices 
revenue from this intercompany sale is eliminated in consolidation 
to date  nmhcmail only fills prescriptions for nmhc plan sponsors 
revenue is recognized by nmhc ascend at the point of shipment to the member 
nmhc ascend invoices individual members  insurance companies  medicare and medicaid  and the pbm 
revenue from intercompany sales are eliminated in consolidation 
cost of claims includes the amounts paid to network pharmacies  including mail service pharmacies  for pharmaceutical claims  and reductions resulting from the gross rebates received from drug manufacturers 
cost of claims is recognized as follows the contractual obligation of nmhc to pay for these drugs is recorded as cost of claims at the time of dispensing of the drug by the pharmacy network 
cost of claims is reduced by the rebates that nmhc receives 
rebates are earned from drug manufacturers based on drugs utilized by plan participants at the time of dispensing 
these rebates  which vary by sponsor  are recorded monthly based upon the claims adjudicated in that month 
the amount of rebates recognized as reductions to revenue or cost of claims is based on estimates tied to actual claims data 
nmhc processes its rebate claims either directly with the drug manufacturers  through its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty  for which it receives administrative fees  or through a third party rebate administrator 
effective july   we have entered into an agreement with a third party rebate administrator the administrator to handle all of our consolidated rebate claims which we do not otherwise submit directly to the drug manufacturers 
the administrator provides estimates to us based on its analysis of the amount of rebates that our claims should generate 
these estimates are prepared based on estimates of how our claims might influence the market share of a particular drug covered under an agreement with a drug manufacturer 
market share is generally defined as the percentage of utilization of a certain drug or drugs within its therapeutic class 
under our contract with the administrator  we receive a specified minimum amount per claim days after the end of a quarter 
amounts above the minimum are shared between the administrator and nmhc with final settlement twelve months after a quarter end 
we accrue rebates based upon an estimate provided by the administrator 
nmhc computes the amount of rebates due direct from the drug manufacturers based on the actual claims data  the criteria established in each individual contract  and the specified payment schedules 
the drug manufacturers are obligated to reimburse us for earned rebates within a specified period of time 
we reconcile our estimates to amounts received from the manufacturers on a quarterly basis 
certain of our sponsors are entitled to all or a portion of rebates received by nmhc  which portion varies contractually by sponsor 
the manufacturer rebates retained by nmhc  after the sponsors receive their contractual amounts  have historically had a significant impact on our financial performance 
for the fiscal years ended june   and the rebates retained by nmhc have equaled  and  respectively  of our total gross profit 
due to the expected continued growth and diversification of our business  we expect rebates to continue to account for a significant  but declining  percentage of our total gross profit 
if such rebate programs were to be discontinued or adversely altered by drug manufacturers  or government action  or if the terms of nmhc s rebate sharing arrangements with its sponsors were adversely altered when these arrangements expire  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
credit risk relating to the rebates receivable is evaluated based on the financial strength of the rebate administrator and the drug manufacturers plus our collection history 
the drug manufacturers contracted with are primarily fortune companies and nmhc has not had a history of write offs related to rebate receivables 
we do not believe a credit risk reserve is necessary 
the pharmacy benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of pharmacy benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  nmhc expects this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue our organic growth through increased marketing of our services and by expanding the range of services offered  including value added consulting and information based services through our nmhc integrail division  home delivery services through nmhcmail  and specialty pharmacy services through our nmhc ascend division 
nmhc believes these services to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  nmhc intends to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement our organic growth by making acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management service providers  as well as related services providers 
operating income in thousands year ended june  increase increase decrease decrease revenue    cost of claims    gross profit    selling  general  and administrative expense    administrative expense operating income    results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a gross revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a net revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  the specific terms of the contracts that nmhc enters into with its sponsors will determine whether nmhc recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
for those contracts that nmhc recognizes net revenue  there is no impact on gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related costs of the prescriptions is recorded 
we include in revenue only those co payments collected from nmhcmail 
for the twelve months ended june   there were approximately million of co payments included in revenue versus approximately million for the twelve months ended june  co payments retained by pharmacies on prescriptions filled for our members and not included in our revenue were million and million  for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
of the million increase in revenue in fiscal  million was due to the inclusion of revenues from pcn  which was included in the revenue from march   but not in the year ended june  in addition  million was due to the inclusion of revenue from inteq  which was included in the revenue for the year ended june   but was only included for three months in the year ended june  co payments received from the mail service operations accounted for million of this increase 
another approximately million of the overall gross revenue increase was due to revenue related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal excluding contracts recorded on a net revenue basis 
an additional increase of approximately million was attributable to other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
these increases were partially offset by revenue decreases related to the termination of existing customer contracts throughout the fiscal year  leading to a reduction in revenue of approximately million 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  pcn accounted for million  of the net increase  while inteq accounted for another million 
new sponsors and the growth in existing sponsors accounted for million of the increase 
this increase was partially offset by the loss of sponsors which reduced cost of claims by million including a million adjustment for previous pharmacy claims 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of claims decreased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts that nmhc recognized on a net revenue basis decreased nmhc s overall costs as a percentage of revenue due to the cost not being recognized on the contracts recorded on the net revenue basis 
in addition  the receipt of an additional million in co payments for nmhcmail operations resulted in a lower cost of claims as a percent of revenue  since no additional cost of claims are incurred related to these fees 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition to the revenue volume increase described above  pcn accounted for million  or  of the increase 
inteq accounted for another million  or of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
the balance of the increase relates to the margins on the new business that replaced the lost business and growth in the existing business from additional services provided 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to for the twelve months ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts nmhc recognizes on a net revenue basis have the effect of improving the gross margin as a percentage of revenue due to the fact that recorded revenue and costs are lower since only the administrative fees related to these contracts are recorded 
the increased activities at nmhcmail and nmhc ascend also led to an increase in gross profit percentage  year over year 
partially offsetting the impact of the net revenue and new activities  nmhc has seen some decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were approximately million of non recurring expenses related to the new mountain transaction see liquidity and capital resources and for the fiscal year ended june  was an approximately million non recurring charge for the settlement of the midwest health plan lawsuit legal settlement 
excluding these non recurring items  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was million 
approximately million  or  of this increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is related to new entities which were part of nmhc in the twelve months ended june  which were not part of nmhc during all of the twelve months ended june  the major components of the million increase in expenses related to the acquisitions were salaries and benefits approximately million  commissions and fess to outside brokers and sales consultants approximately million  depreciation and amortization approximately million  rent and related expenses approximately million  it expenses approximately million  professional fees approximately million  and other approximately million 
non acquisition related increases included salaries and benefits from increased headcount million  commissions and fees to outside brokers and sales consultants million  professional fees much as a result of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act million  it expenses million and other million 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the main reasons for the increase were the impact of recognizing more contracts on a net revenue basis 
for the fiscal year ended june   nmhc earned other income  net  of approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended june   we earned other income  net  of approximately  the primary component of the increase in other income was the realization of a million gain from an insurance claim which represented the excess of the insurance proceeds over the carrying value of the assets covered by the claim 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary factors leading to this increase were the rises in gross profit and other income  offset by the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the new activities 
the effective tax rate decreased from for the twelve months ended june  to for the twelve months ended june  the main reason for the decrease was a reduction in nmhc s state income taxes 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
the increase in net income is attributable to the same factors causing the increase in income before income taxes  in addition to the lower effective tax rate 
in addition  there were three other charges recorded to determine income loss available to common stockholders related to the new mountain transaction 
the first of these charges relates to preferred stock cash dividends  which amounted to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  the preferred stock provides for an initial cash dividend equal to of the investment amount currently million  which decreases to after the fifth anniversary of issuance 
all dividends accrued in each fiscal year were paid by the end of the given fiscal year 
the second charge during the fiscal year ended june  was the million beneficial conversion feature 
this non recurring  non cash charge represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the closing of the new mountain transaction and the effective conversion price of  and which is limited to the million purchase price for the series a preferred stock 
the third charge is for the accretion of transaction expenses 
certain transaction costs of approximately million related to the new mountain transaction preferred stock investment are deducted from net proceeds and the carrying value of the series a preferred stock 
these transaction costs are accreted to the series a preferred stock carrying value over the ten year life of the preferred stock investment 
such accretion amounted to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  after deducting these three charges from net income there remained net income available to common stockholders of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  while net income and net income available to common stockholders excluding the non recurring legal settlement and new mountain transaction items are not measures of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  they are provided as information for investors for analysis purposes in evaluating the effect of the non recurring legal settlement and the new mountain transaction on net income and net income available to common stockholders 
net income and net income available to common stockholders excluding the non recurring legal settlement and new mountain transaction items are not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for net income or net income loss available to common stockholders as prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the reconciliation from net income to net income available to common stockholders excluding the non recurring legal settlement and new mountain transaction items  is as follows all amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts twelve months ended june  june  net income  as reported   add back legal settlement  net of income tax benefits  transaction bonuses and severance payment  net of income tax benefit compensation charge related to stock option issued in lieu of transaction bonus  net of income tax benefit compensation charge related to the acceleration of directors options  net of income tax benefit net income excluding non recurring legal settlement and new mountain transaction items c   less preferred dividends   accretion of transaction expenses net income available to common shareholders excluding non recurring legal settlement and new mountain transaction items a   earnings per share excluding non recurring legal settlement and new mountain transaction items basic a b diluted c d weighted average number of shares outstanding basic b   diluted d   diluted weighted average number of shares assumes the conversion of the  shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and dilutive common stock options and warrants 
nmhc has no off balance sheet transactions 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a gross revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a net revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  the specific terms of the contracts that nmhc enters into with its sponsors will determine whether nmhc recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
for those contracts that nmhc recognizes net revenue  there is no impact on gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related costs of the prescriptions is recorded 
nmhc includes in revenue only those co payments collected from nmhcmail 
for the twelve months ended june   there were approximately million of co payments included in revenue versus zero for the twelve months ended june  co payments retained by pharmacies on prescriptions filled for nmhc s members and not included in nmhc s revenue were million and million  for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
of the million increase in revenue in fiscal  million was due to the inclusion of revenues from ascend and inteq  which were included in the revenue for the twelve months ended june   but not in the twelve months ended june  another approximate million of the overall gross revenue increase was due to revenue related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal excluding contracts recorded on a net revenue basis 
an additional increase of approximately million was attributable to other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
these increases were partially offset by revenue decreases related to three factors the termination of existing customer contracts throughout the fiscal year including one major sponsor which terminated their contract effective december   leading to a reduction in revenue of approximately million  and there was one contract during the twelve months ended june  that nmhc recognized on a net revenue basis that was recognized on a gross revenue basis for four months during the twelve months ended june  due to a change in the contract terms effective november   this customer s revenue was recognized on a net basis from that point 
the revenue impact of this change was a year over year reduction of gross revenue of approximately million 
the third decrease occurred as a result of rebates payable to nmhc s sponsors increasing by million for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  since these rebates are treated as a reduction in revenue  this led to a reduction in the overall year over year revenue increase 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  ascend and inteq accounted for million  of the net increase 
new sponsors and the growth in existing sponsors accounted for million of the increase 
this increase was partially offset by the three factors described in the previous paragraph  namely  the loss of sponsors which reduced cost of claims by million  the recognizing of a certain contract on a net revenue basis which reduced cost of claims by million  and an increase of million in gross rebates received  which is treated as a reduction in cost of claims 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of claims decreased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the same factors contributed to the declining costs as a percentage of revenue 
the major sponsor  which terminated its contract  is a managed care organization 
industry wide  managed care clients have a greater cost of claims  and consequently a lower gross margin  than other types of business in the pbm industry 
the new business nmhc brought on during the fiscal year ended june   for the most part was not managed care  so consequently the cost of claims on the new business was lower than on the business it replaced 
in addition  the contracts recognized on a net revenue basis decrease the overall company costs as a percentage of revenue due to the cost not being recognized on the contracts recorded on the net revenue basis 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition to the revenue volume increase described above  ascend and inteq accounted for million  or  of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
the balance of the increase relates to the margins on the new business that replaced the lost business and growth in the existing business from additional services provided 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to for the twelve months ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts nmhc recognizes on a net revenue basis have the effect of improving the gross margin as a percent of revenue due to the lower revenue base 
the new activities at nmhc mail and ascend also led to an increase in gross profit percentage  year over year 
partially offsetting the impact of the net revenue and new activities  nmhc has seen some decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  approximately million  or  of this increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is related to new entities which were part of nmhc in the twelve months ended june  which were not part of nmhc during all of the twelve months ended june  the services provided by these entities include specialty pharmacy distribution through nmhc s acquisition of ppp  predictive modeling and consulting services through nmhc s acquisition of integrail  and mail order distribution through nmhc s owned facility in miramar  florida 
in addition  pbm services were complemented and enhanced by the acquisition of inteq 
the major components of the million increase in expenses related to new services was salaries and benefits approximately  postage and supplies approximately  equipment rental approximately  insurance approximately  marketing approximately  depreciation and amortization approximately  commissions to outside brokers approximately  and postage and shipping approximately  included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june  were approximately  of non recurring expenses related to the new mountain transaction including transaction bonuses and a severance payment totaling  a non cash compensation charge of approximately  related to the acceleration of stock options for two directors who resigned upon the closing of the new mountain transaction and a non cash compensation charge and related expenses of approximately  related to stock options issued in lieu of a transaction bonus 
of the remaining approximate million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the twelve months ended june   the majority of the increase is related to the increased revenue and volume in the pbm 
salary and benefits related to new hires  temporary help  travel and entertainment  and commissions to internal sales people as well as external brokers have all increased year over year due to the increased volume of activity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the main reasons for the increase are the impact of recognizing more contracts on a net revenue basis  as that has the effect of dividing these same expenses over a smaller gross revenue base  the million of non recurring expenses related to new mountain which added basis points  and the start up of nmhcmail 
for the fiscal year ended june   nmhc earned other income  net  of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   nmhc incurred other expense  net  of approximately  the components of the approximate  increase in other income  net were an approximate  decrease in interest expense  an approximate  increase in interest income  slightly offset by an approximate  reduced gain on assets sold 
the primary reasons for the net increase in income were interest expense declined due to the reduced borrowings under nmhc s revolving credit facility due to increasing profitability and additional cash flow from operations see item  description of business recent acquisitions and developments  and note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  and interest income increased due to the interest portion of a settlement  with an outside party  related to past due rebates owed to nmhc  and excess cash balances related to some of nmhc s acquisitions 
nmhc entered into a new sale leaseback with an unrelated third party in november this led to an approximate  gain on the sale of assets during the twelve months ended june  the total gain from this transaction was approximately  which was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized over the life of the lease  which is thirty six months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
this gain was offset by approximately  related to assets written off when ascend moved to a new facility in portland 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the increase was the improving efficiencies that come with scale arising from the integration of the acquisitions nmhc has completed 
the start up of the mail order facility had the impact of reducing overall profitability in the year ended june  the effective tax rate decreased from for the twelve months ended june  to for the twelve months ended june  the main reason for the decrease was a decline in nmhc s federal statutory rate 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
net income for the twelve months ended june  includes the million after tax impact of the new mountain transaction items 
liquidity and capital resources nmhc s primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures and operating expenses  including cost of pharmaceuticals  software and hardware upgrades and the funding of accounts receivable 
effective july  nmhc requires cash to carry inventory in our mail service facility and specialty pharmacy 
also  we require cash for potential acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management companies or of companies providing related services 
as of june   we had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a working capital deficit of million as of june  the primary reason for the improvement in working capital was the profitability generated by nmhc during the fiscal year ended june  offset by the acquisition of pcn 
nmhc has now acquired seven companies since july utilizing primarily cash 
this has had the effect of increasing our working capital deficits until sufficient profitability is earned to offset these deficits 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary factor contributing to this million decrease in cash provided by operations was the timing of the pcn acquisition 
on march   the date of the acquisition  pcn had cash on hand exceeding million  the vast majority of which was earmarked for payment within the next few days to the various dispensing pharmacies 
generally accepted accounting principles require that all acquisitions be reported net of cash acquired 
because the million of cash on hand exceeded the acquisition price of million and related acquisition costs of million  the pcn acquisition was reported as a million cash source of funds 
the timing of this event caused nmhc s cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended june  to be million 
whereas  had the pcn acquisition not occurred  nmhc would have reported net cash provided by operating activities of million and net cash used in investing activities of million  and net cash used in financing activities of for the fiscal year ended june  while cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition are not measures of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  they are provided as information for investors for analysis purposes in evaluating the effect of the pcn acquisition on cash flow from operating and investing activities 
cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition is not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for cash flow from operating and investing activities as prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the reconciliation from cash flow from operating and investing activities to cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition  is as follows for the fiscal year ended june  june  unaudited unaudited net cash provided by operating activities  as reported   impact of pcn on cash flow from operations for the period march june   net cash provided by operating activities  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition   net cash used in investing activities  as reported   impact of pcn acquisition at march  on cash flow from investing activities  net cash used in investing activities  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition   net cash used in provided by financing activities  as reported   impact of pcn on cash flow used in provided by financing activities for the period march june  net cash used in provided by financing activities  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition   cash and cash equivalents at end of period  as reported   impact of pcn acquisition at march  and pcn s operations for the period march june   cash and cash equivalents at end of period  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition   historically  the timing of nmhc s accounts receivable and accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan sponsors on the one hand  and our pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to our payments to participating pharmacies being slower than our corresponding collections from plan sponsors 
nmhc believes that this situation is not unusual in the pharmacy benefit management industry and expects to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  we could require additional working capital financing 
we have put in place a million revolving credit facility for acquisitions and working capital financing 
however  if such terms of trade were to change materially  and or if nmhc were unable to obtain additional working capital financing  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended june   as compared to million for the twelve months ended june  this decrease of million in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions 
total cash expenditures in the fiscal year ended june  for acquisitions  primarily ppp and inteq  amounted to million  as compared to cash generated from acquisitions of million for the fiscal year ended june  also during the fiscal year ended june   million of cash was generated from the repayment of affiliate and officer loans 
finally  capital expenditures were million including millino of capitalized internal use software for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million including million of capitalized internal use software for the fiscal year ended june   a reduction of million when comparing the two fiscal years 
during the fiscal year ended june   nmhc used million from financing activities as compared to receiving million in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease of million is the result of million from the issuance of nmhc s series a preferred stock net of million for the purchase of nmhc s shares in the tender offer in the fiscal year ended june  further  in the fiscal year ended june   cash was reduced by a net repayment under the revolving credit facility compared to no net activity in the fiscal year ended june  finally  an additional million was paid for dividends on the convertible preferred stock during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  offset by million less in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to the prior year 
on january   nmhc entered into a five year million cash flow based  line of credit with a syndicate of commercial banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan 
subject to certain conditions  the new line of credit may be increased by an aggregate of million 
the line of credit facility contains various covenants that  among other things  require nmhc to maintain certain financial ratios  which are consolidated net worth  consolidated fixed charge ratio and consolidated debt to ebitda ratio 
as of june   there was no principal balance outstanding under the line of credit facility  and nmhc was in compliance with its financial covenants 
two of these financial covenants are based upon the ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization generated by nmhc over specified periods of time 
these covenants  consolidated fixed charge ratio and consolidated debt to ebitda ratio  are evaluated by the lender as a measure of nmhc s liquidity and its ability to meet all of its obligations under the credit facility 
ebitda is presented as cash flow from operations plus or minus the net changes in assets and liabilities and the changes in certain non cash reconciling items from net cash from operations to net income over the reported periods 
while ebitda is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles  it is provided as information for investors for analytical purposes in light of the financial covenants referred to above 
ebitda is not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for net income or cash flow from operations as prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda  which increased by approximately million or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   is calculated as follows year ended june  cash flow from operations    provision for income taxes    interest income expense  net net change in assets and liabilities    non cash items to reconcile net cash from operations to net income   ebitda    see consolidated statement of cash flows comprising item hereof for more details 
nmhc has entered into various capital lease transactions for hardware and software 
nmhc has also assumed various capital leases through its acquisitions 
the principal balance of all capital leases as of june  was approximately  nmhc has entered into various real estate operating leases with both related and unrelated parties 
nmhc has entered into various operating leases with unrelated third parties for office equipment 
these leases have different payment terms and expirations dates 
nmhc also entered into a sale leaseback operating lease of certain fixed assets principally mail service equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof for a further description of these various real estate and operating leases

nmhc anticipates that current cash positions  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
this is based upon current levels of capital expenditures and anticipated operating results for the next months 
however  it is one of our stated goals to acquire other pharmacy benefit management companies and companies providing related services 
depending on our evaluation of future acquisitions  additional cash may be required to complete these acquisitions 
in addition  we will require cash to acquire inventory for our mail service and specialty distribution operations 
in the event that nmhc s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate  or the proceeds from the jpmorgan credit facility and the new mountain transaction prove to be insufficient to fund operations and acquisitions  we could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

critical accounting policies and estimates general nmhc s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon nmhc s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  nmhc evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debt  intangible assets  income taxes  and financing operations 
nmhc bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
nmhc believes that of its significant accounting policie  s which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others revenue recognition a since january   services provided by nmhc have been on a fee for service basis 
under the fee for service arrangement  we are paid by our sponsors for our contractually agreed upon rates based upon actual claims adjudicated  plus a fixed transaction fee 
revenue under the fee for service arrangement is recognized when the claims are adjudicated 
included as revenue are our administrative fees and charges relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed by our network of pharmacies 
revenue is reduced by the amount of rebates paid to our sponsors 
b the specific terms of the contracts that nmhc enters into with its sponsors will determine whether we recognize the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
there are several factors from eitf that led us to recognize the majority of our revenue on a gross basis 
these include nmhc acts as a principal and not an agent and is the primary obligor in the relationship among the pharmacies  the sponsors and nmhc  nmhc has credit risk  nmhc has certain latitude in establishing price  and nmhc has discretion in supplier selection 
in certain cases  primarily because the amount we earn is fixed  we have not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on our gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
c nmhc includes in revenue only those co payments collected from individual members by nmhcmail 
co payments retained by pharmacies on the remainder of the prescriptions filled for our members are not included in our reported revenue 
we disclose these amounts parenthetically on the face of our consolidated statement of income 
d rebates are recognized when we are entitled to them in accordance with the terms of our arrangements with drug manufacturers  third party rebate administrators  and sponsors  and when the amount of the rebates is determinable 
nmhc records the gross rebate receivable and the appropriate payable to the sponsors based on estimates  which are subject to final settlement 
the estimates are based upon the claims submitted and our rebate experience  and are adjusted as additional information becomes available 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the liability of our sponsors to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our sponsors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on july  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues on a periodic basis thereafter 
to date  we have not recorded any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
deferred taxes nmhc periodically considers whether or not we should record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event nmhc were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
