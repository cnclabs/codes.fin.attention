item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this annual report on form k 
references contained herein to  and mean the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   respectively 
general as of january   we operated high end  high volume restaurants in the united states 
we believe that the particularly large size of the markets we entered warranted investment in restaurants with seating capacities ranging from to we currently do not have any leases signed other than leases relating to our existing locations and will not actively pursue new locations in we plan to move ahead cautiously with our future expansion as management evaluates and monitors economic conditions and the availability of capital 
we expect to resume our new restaurant growth in we expect additional locations to have seating capacities ranging from to seats  but would consider locations with larger or smaller seating capacities where appropriate 
we believe these new restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment of million to million net of landlord contributions and excluding pre opening expenses 
this range assumes that the property on which the new unit is located is being leased and is dependent on the size of the location and the amount of the landlord contribution 
our newest unit in boston significantly exceeded this range primarily because of its physical size and to undetected defects directly associated with the renovations to the building  which is over years old and which has been lightly used over the last years  as well as the additional cost related to the adherence to a stricter building code than originally anticipated 
some locations that we choose will be outside our preferred cash investment range  but are nevertheless accepted based on our evaluation of the potential returns 
as a result of our recent expansion and when our locations opened  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new restaurant opens  we typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs as a percentage of sales during the first year of its operation 
average sales for our twelve consolidated units open for all of were million per restaurant 
in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for months 
pursuant to management contracts and arrangements  we operate  but do not own  the original smith wollensky  maloney porcelli  and the post house restaurants in new york 
consolidated restaurant sales include gross sales less sales taxes and other discounts 
cost of consolidated restaurant sales include food and beverage costs  salaries and related benefits  restaurant operating expenses  occupancy and related expenses  marketing and promotional expenses and restaurant level depreciation and amortization 
salaries and related benefits include components of restaurant labor  including direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  fringe benefits and related payroll taxes 
restaurant operating expenses include operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs and other operating expenses 
occupancy and related expenses include rent  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs 
management fee income relates to fees that we receive from our managed units 
these fees are based on a percentage of sales from the managed units  ranging from to 
prior to december  we operated park avenue caf in chicago  mrs 
park s tavern and the other services of the food and beverage department of doubletree pursuant to the doubletree agreement 
we received a management fee equal to the sum of of sales and a percentage of earnings  as defined 
the doubletree agreement was to expire on the earlier of december  or the termination of the related hotel management agreement between hsr  the owner of the doubletree and doubletree partners  the manager of the doubletree 
during december  hsr closed the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago and discontinued our requirement to provide other food and beverage department service for the doubletree 
as a result  we no longer receive the fees described above 
during the three month period ended march   we reached an agreement with hsr 
the agreement provides for the continued use by hsr of the name mrs 
parks tavern and required us to provide management services to support that location 
in exchange for the use of the mrs 
park s tavern name and related management support the company received an annual fee of  during  we agreed to reduce the annual fee to  for the continued use by hsr of the name mrs 
parks tavern  but no longer provide management services to support the location 
management fee income also included fees received from onecps on december   we amended the agreement with plaza operating partners 
effective january   plaza operating partners agreed to pay us  per quarter as a minimum base management fee 
the minimum base management fee was credited against any management fee that we earned under the agreement 
this amendment also gave either party the right to fund or refuse to fund any necessary working capital requirements 
if neither party was willing to fund the required additional working capital contributions  as defined  then either party could have terminated the agreement 
plaza operating partners agreed to fund until october   the date that we were notified by plaza operating partners that it sold the plaza hotel  the property in which the restaurant was located  and directed us to advise the employees of onecps of the closing 
we funded the cash requirements of onecps until january   the date on which we were required to close the restaurant at the direction of the new owner 
on november   we informed certain of our employees that onecps would close effective january  as a result  we are no longer accruing additional quarterly management fees under our agreement with plaza operating partners with respect to any periods following january  general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing owned and managed operations and provide infrastructure to our organization 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel costs  information systems  training costs  corporate rent  corporate insurance and professional and consulting fees 
pre opening costs incurred in connection with the opening of new restaurants are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses also include the depreciation of corporate level property and equipment and the amortization of corporate intangible assets  such as licensing agreements and management contracts 
royalty expense represents fees paid pursuant to a licensing agreement with st 
james associates  based upon of sales  as defined  for restaurants utilizing the smith wollensky name 
wherever we refer to a particular year  we refer to our or week fiscal year ending on the monday nearest december  unless otherwise noted 
fiscal year ended january  consisted of weeks and the fiscal years ended december  and december  each consisted of week periods 
restatements a on october   it was determined that the accounting treatment for the april amendment to the lease for our las vegas property april amendment was inaccurately reflected in the financial statements for the quarter and fiscal year ended december  included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   and for the quarterly periods ended june   september   march  and june   included in our quarterly reports on form q for the respective quarters ended june   september   march  and june  and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
in connection with the april amendment  it was originally determined that the deferred rent liability outstanding as of april  relating to the las vegas property should be amortized on a straight line basis through april this amortization was recorded as a reduction to occupancy and related expenses and was derived from the reduction in deferred rent liability 
the deferred rent liability should have been treated as a reduction to the value of the land under the capital lease at april  the total impact of this restatement on our statement of operations was to increase our net loss for the fiscal year ended december  by  or 
per share 
on november   a letter was signed by morgan stanley confirming the exclusion of the elimination of the non cash income derived from the amortization of the deferred rent liability relating to the las vegas lease from the financial covenants contained in our term loan agreements and line of credit facilities for the periods referenced above 
we filed a report on form k on november  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note b on february   it was determined  after analyzing the views expressed by the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec in a letter issued in february to the american institute of certified public accountants guiding all affected public companies regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles  that the accounting treatment for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances was inaccurately reflected in the financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal years ended december  and december   and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september   march   june  and september  and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
under the previous accounting treatment  tenant improvement allowances received by us from the landlord were recorded as a reduction to leasehold improvements 
these cash payments received by us should have been treated as an increase to deferred rent liability  as of the date we took control over the leased premises  and amortized over the initial term of the lease  including renewal periods 
the impact of this restatement was a reclassification of  and  from leasehold improvements to deferred rent liability at december  and december   respectively  and a reclassification from occupancy and related expenses to depreciation and amortization expense of  and  for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
we filed a report on form k a on march  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note c on april   after doing additional analysis in accordance with the guidelines from the sec regarding lease accounting  as described above  it was determined that our accounting for lease terms was inaccurately reflected in the financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september   march   june  and september  and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
under the previous accounting treatment  for certain restaurants  we recorded rent on a straight line basis  commencing on the date the restaurant opened 
we should have recognized rent on a straight line basis from the date that we took control over the leased premise and should have capitalized the rent into leasehold improvements and amortized it on a straight line basis over the life of the initial lease term  including renewal periods 
in addition  we also determined that we had amortized leasehold improvements on a straight line basis over the life of the initial lease term  including renewal periods  but had  in certain instances  amortized the deferred rent liability relating to the same leased premises over only the life of the initial lease term 
we should have amortized the deferred rent liability over the life of the initial lease term  including renewal periods 
we filed a report on form k on april  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the total impact of the restatements  discussed above in b and c  was to increase our accumulated deficit by  as of december   increase our net loss for the fiscal year ended december  by  or 
per share and increase our net loss for the fiscal year ended december  by  or 
per share 
d on april   it was determined that we had incorrectly calculated our estimate of gift certificates that were sold and deemed to have expired and not redeemed in the financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal years ended december  and december  and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
in addition  it was also determined that we had not properly recorded expenses related to certain promotions that we ran from the fiscal year ended january  through january   for which gift certificates were issued at either a full or partial discount 
these expenses should have been included in the financial statements for the fiscal years ended january   december   december  and december  included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september   march   june  and september  and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
the total impact of this restatement on our financial statements was to increase our accumulated deficit at december  by  increase our net loss for the fiscal year ended december  by  or 
per share and increase our net loss for the fiscal year ended december  by  or 
per share 
we filed a report on form k on april  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note e certain other miscellaneous adjustments previously considered insignificant to the financial statements have now been recorded in conjunction with the restatements 
the total impact of these adjustments on our statement of operations was to decrease our net loss for the year ended december  by  or 
per share and increase our net loss for the year ended december  by  or 
per share 
we filed a report on form k on april  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements 
the effect of the restatements changed the amounts previously reported under cash provided from operating activities and the cash used for investing activities by  and  for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
in connection with the above  a letter was signed by morgan stanley confirming the exclusion of the restatement adjustments relating to certain of our leases and the accounting for gift certificates from the financial covenants contained in our term loan agreements and line of credit facilities for the periods described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements

we and our audit committee have discussed the above errors and adjustments with our predecessor and current independent registered public accounting firms and have determined that a restatement is necessary for the periods described above 
this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  reflects the changes for the annual results for the years ended january   december   december  and december  we will file our quarterly reports on form q a for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september   as soon as practicable in connection with the restatements described above 
restatement and change in accounting principle the presented consolidated financial statements relating to fiscal include the accounts and results of the entity that owns maloney porcelli as a direct result of the adoption of fin r 
for comparability purposes  the unaudited accounts and results of maloney porcelli for fiscal and fiscal are being included on a pro forma basis in the table below 
fin r addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
all variable interest entities  regardless of when created  are required to be evaluated under fin r no later than the first period ending after march  an entity shall be subject to consolidation according to the provisions of this interpretation if  by design  as a group the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any one of the following three characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
we consolidated the accounts and results of the entity that owns maloney porcelli because the holders of the equity investment lacked one of the above characteristics 
in connection with the adoption of fin r  our net investment in the maloney agreement  previously classified under management contract  net and management fees and miscellaneous charges receivable classified under accounts receivable  have been eliminated in consolidation and  instead  the separable assets and liabilities of the entity that owns maloney porcelli are presented 
on april   it was determined that the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of fin r was inaccurately reflected in the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september  and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
under the previous accounting treatment  the accumulated amortization of  relating to the million paid by us in fiscal for the right to provide management services for maloney porcelli was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change pursuant to the adoption of fin r 
the entity that owns maloney porcelli recorded the million  but did not record the associated amortization 
a correction of an error should have been recorded on the unaudited accounts and results of the entity that owns maloney porcelli to recognize the accumulated amortization relating to the million 
the million and the related accumulated amortization would then both be eliminated in the consolidation of maloney porcelli 
the impact of this restatement on the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september  is to increase the interest in consolidated variable interest entity by  and to increase the accumulated deficit by  in addition  the financial statements for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september   included in our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september   are being restated to exclude the accounts and results of the entity that owns maloney porcelli due to the impracticality associated with having to restate prior years as well there being no impact from this restatement on our net income loss and earnings loss per share for those periods 
we and our audit committee have discussed the above errors and adjustments with our predecessor and current independent registered public accounting firms and have determined that a restatement is necessary for the periods described above 
we will file our quarterly reports on form q a for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september  as soon as practicable in connection with these restatements 
we filed a report on form k on april  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements

the preparation of these financial statements require us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  gift certificate liability  lease accounting  income tax valuation allowances and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales from consolidated restaurants are recognized as revenue at the point of the delivery of meals and services 
management fee income is recognized as the related management fee is earned pursuant to the respective agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from credit card processing companies or individuals that have good historical track records of payment 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  from  in to  in the net decrease in the allowance was determined by conducting a specific review of major account balances and by applying statistical experience factors to the various aging categories of receivable balances 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the actual payment history of each individual customer  as well as considering changes that occur in the financial condition or the local economy of a particular customer that could affect our bad debt expenses and allowance for doubtful accounts 
long lived assets we review long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by restaurant comparing the carrying amount of the restaurant s assets to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit  its individual results and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of fair value of reporting units acquired in the formation of the company over the book value of those reporting units identifiable net assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we had originally determined that certain of our restaurants with assigned goodwill were separate reporting units 
as a result of the consensus reached in september by the emerging issues task force eitf in regard to determining whether to aggregate operating segments of an enterprise  we concluded that the entities that were previously viewed as separate reporting entities could now be viewed as one single reporting entity for purposes of assessing goodwill 
as such  we compared the fair value of the single reporting entity to the total equity carrying value to determine if impairment exists 
the fair value is calculated using various methods  including an analysis based on projected discounted future operating cash flows of the single reporting entity using a discount rate reflecting our weighted average cost of capital 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the single reporting entity 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
prior to  we had recorded an impairment of goodwill of  during related to our mrs 
parks management company reporting unit 
this impairment related to lower than anticipated future cash flow for us from the closing by the hotel owner of the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago 
for  the fair value of the single reporting entity is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the carrying value of goodwill as of january  and december  was million 
other intangible assets we review other intangible assets  which include costs attributable to a sale and licensing agreement and the cost of the acquisition of management contracts  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of our intangible assets will be assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected net cash flows to be generated by such assets 
an intangible asset would be considered impaired if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of the assets generating those cash flows 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized will be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the assessment of the recoverability of these intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
during  we determined that the carrying amount of the management contract and receivable from the onecps restaurant was not recoverable and an impairment had occurred 
we recorded a one time charge for investment in managed restaurants of  in the third quarter of  which consisted of a  charge against the net investment in the management contract and a  charge against the receivable 
for our other intangible assets  the fair value is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the net carrying value of these intangible assets as of january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
artwork we purchase artwork and antiques for display in our restaurants 
we do not depreciate artwork and antiques since these assets have cultural  aesthetic or historical value that is worth preserving perpetually and we have the ability and intent to protect and preserve these assets 
such assets are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the net carrying value of our artwork as of january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
self insurance liability we are self insured for our employee health program 
we maintain stop loss insurance to limit our total exposure and individual claims 
the liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical medical claim patterns and known economic conditions 
if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
however  we believe that a change in our current accrual requirement of or less would cause a change of approximately  or less  to our financial results 
gift certificate liability we record a gift certificate liability for gift certificates sold to customers to be redeemed at a future date 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized when the gift certificates are redeemed 
lease accounting we use the lease term plus any renewal period in determining the life of a lease 
the renewal period is included in the life because we base our original willingness to invest in a new location on our plan to maximize our return on investment over the entire period available which includes the renewal period 
we only select locations where we can obtain long term leases  including renewal options 
if we gain access to the premise prior to the commencement of the lease  then this additional period is added to the original lease term 
we amortize certain costs associated with the lease over the life of the lease plus the renewal period 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the amortization of leasehold improvements and the amortization of deferred rent liability 
we include tenant allowances received by us from the landlord as an increase to our deferred rent liability 
the amortization period for deferred rent is over the life of the accounting lease  which includes  the date from which we obtain control over the premises to the ending date of the legal lease document  which includes the renewal period 
any rent or deferred rent expense incurred during the construction period is capitalized as a part of leasehold improvements and is amortized on a straight line basis from the date operations commence over the remaining life of the lease  which includes the renewal period 
fin r fin r addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
all variable interest entities  regardless of when created  were required to be evaluated under fin r no later than the first period ending after march  an entity shall be subject to consolidation according to the provisions of this interpretation if  by design  as a group the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any one of the following three characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
we perform a detailed analysis of all of our management arrangements to determine if any of the equity investments lack one of the above characteristics 
we consolidated the accounts and results of the entity that owns maloney porcelli for the fiscal year ended january  because the holders of the equity investment lacked one of the above characteristics 
legal proceedings we are involved in various claims and legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is not remote and can be reasonably estimated  a liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and income tax valuation allowances we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes and estimates related to the ultimate realization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
at january   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million and other timing differences of million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal and certain state jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income for federal and state purposes and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events and operating results 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes

the purchase price was approximately million at may   and escalates to approximately million at the end of five years 
we are required to make down payments on the purchase of the property

in connection with the april amendment  it was originally determined that the deferred rent liability outstanding as of april  relating to the las vegas property should be amortized on a straight line basis through april this amortization was included as a reduction to occupancy and related expenses and was derived from the reduction in deferred rent liability 
the deferred rent liability should have been treated as a reduction to the value of the land under the capital lease at april  we filed a report on form k on november  describing this restatement and its impact on our financial statements

any gain recognized would be deferred and recognized over the life of the lease 
the new lease will have a year term and require the borrower to pay a negotiated rent  subject to certain increases over time 
the vegas agreement contains  and the new lease is expected to contain  representations  warranties  covenants and indemnities that are typical for transactions of this kind 
although the transactions are expected to close during the quarter ending july   the transactions are subject to a number of closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated 
the borrower is currently evaluating the accounting treatment for this transaction 
liquidity we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  projected cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of the las vegas property should be sufficient to finance our maintenance capital expenditures in respect of existing units and operations throughout  as well as allow us to meet our debt service obligations under our loan agreements 
our cash resources  and therefore our liquidity  are dependent upon the level of internally generated cash from operations 
changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  failure to consummate the sale of the las vegas property  or other events could cause us to seek alternative financing or reschedule our maintenance capital expenditure plans as early as january while we would seek to obtain additional funds through commercial borrowings or the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities  there can be no assurance that such funds would be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us

as we continue to expand in other locations  the seasonality pattern may change 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease and labor costs
