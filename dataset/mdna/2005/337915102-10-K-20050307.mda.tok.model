glba authorizes bank holding companies that meet certain requirements to operate as a new type of financial holding company and offer a broader range of financial products and services than are generally permitted by banks themselves 
firstmerit has not elected to become a financial holding company under this new regulatory framework 
dividends and transactions with affiliates firstmerit is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary bank and other subsidiaries 
firstmerit s principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and service its debt is 
table of contents dividends from these subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that firstmerit bank may pay to firstmerit without regulatory approval 
the ability of firstmerit bank to pay dividends in the future is currently influenced  and could be further influenced  by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines 
under current federal reserve board policy  firstmerit is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and  under appropriate circumstances  to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank 
this support could be required at times when firstmerit might not have the resources to provide it 
in addition  the occ may order the pro rata assessment of firstmerit if the capital of its national bank subsidiary were to become impaired 
if firstmerit failed to pay the assessment timely  the occ could order the sale of its stock in the national bank subsidiary to cover the deficiency 
firstmerit s banking subsidiary is subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from this subsidiary to firstmerit and its nonbanking subsidiaries  including affiliates  whether in the form of loans and other extensions of credit  investments and asset purchases  or as other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate 
moreover  loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts 
a bank s transactions with its nonbank affiliates also are generally required to be on arm s length terms 
capital loans from firstmerit to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank 
in the event of firstmerit s bankruptcy  any commitment by firstmerit to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 
the federal deposit insurance act provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution such as firstmerit bank  the insured and uninsured depositors  along with the fdic  will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured  nondeposit creditors  including firstmerit  with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 
capital requirements general 
firstmerit is subject to risk based capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the federal reserve board 
these are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the occ and the fdic on the depository institutions under their jurisdictions 
for this purpose  a depository institution s or holding company s assets  and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations  are assigned to various risk categories 
a depository institution s or holding company s capital  in turn  is classified in one of three tiers  depending on type core tier capital  supplementary tier capital  and market risk tier capital 
tier capital includes common equity  qualifying perpetual preferred equity  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets 
tier capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments and mandatory convertible debt securities  perpetual preferred equity not meeting tier capital requirements  qualifying term subordinated debt  medium term preferred equity  certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities  and the allowance for loan and lease losses 
tier capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
information concerning firstmerit s regulatory capital requirements is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  and in capital resources under item federal reserve board  fdic and occ rules require firstmerit to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into its risk based capital standards 
under these market risk requirements  capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution s ongoing trading activities 

table of contents the federal reserve board may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described previously for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it 
for example  holding companies experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the federal reserve board has also indicated that it will consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
firstmerit bank is subject to similar risk based and leverage capital requirements adopted by its applicable federal banking agency 
firstmerit s management believes that firstmerit bank meets all capital requirements to which it is subject 
failure to meet capital requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies  including the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to restrictions on its business  which are described under the next paragraph 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
it requires us federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements based on these categories 
fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
firstmerit believes that its bank subsidiary was well capitalized at december   based on these prompt corrective action ratios and guidelines 
a bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying the occ s or the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations  and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes 
deposit insurance assessments the fdic insures the deposits of firstmerit s depository institution subsidiary through the bank insurance fund bif up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors 
specifically  the assessment rate is based on the institution s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category 
an institution s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
an institution s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 
the bif assessment rate currently ranges from zero to cents per of domestic deposits basis points 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis  based on its evaluation of an institution s financial condition 
an increase in the bif assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on firstmerit s earnings  depending on the amount of the increase 
the fdic is also authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for firstmerit s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on firstmerit s earnings 
all fdic insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  commonly referred to as fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 

table of contents the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fdic s insurance funds and do not vary regardless of a depository institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
fiscal and monetary policies firstmerit s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
firstmerit is particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve board  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities  b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions  c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions deposits  and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by banks and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason alone  the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on the earnings of firstmerit 
privacy provisions of gramm leach bliley act under glba  federal banking regulators were required to adopt rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party 
future legislation various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced in congress 
such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of firstmerit and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways  and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it or any implementing regulations  would have on the financial condition or results of operations of firstmerit or any of its subsidiaries 
summary to the extent that the previous information describes statutory and regulatory provisions  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of those provisions 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and are subject to change at any time 
any such change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to firstmerit could have a material effect on the business of firstmerit

although firstmerit is not able to predict the outcome of such actions  after reviewing pending and threatened actions with counsel  management believes that the outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or stockholders equity of firstmerit

the sale of the corporation s million manufactured housing portfolio in december impacts a comparison of net interest income between the fourth quarter of and the year ago quarter

net interest income net interest income  the corporation s principal source of earnings  is the difference between interest income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and interest paid on interest bearing funds namely customer deposits and wholesale borrowings 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities  the mix of funding between interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for year ended december  the million decline in net interest income occurred because the million decline in interest expense was less than the million decline in interest income during the same period 
for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
that is  interest on taxfree securities and tax exempt loans has been restated as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense incurred to acquire the taxfree assets

the same occurred between years ended and as the decline in interest income outpaced the decline in interest expense 
as illustrated in the following rate volume analysis table  interest income and interest expense both declined due to the historic or near historic low interest rate environment 
the average yield on earning assets dropped basis points from in to in lowering interest income by million 
lower outstanding balances on total average earning assets caused interest income to decrease million from year ago levels

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in as discussed in the previous section  the decrease in the net interest margin during was primarily a result of lower yields and volume earned on loans  and securities outpacing reductions in lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings

allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the corporation and firstmerit bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowance through ongoing review of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  nonperforming assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
notes  and to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices

during the first quarter of  the corporation strengthened the allowance for loan losses by providing an additional million above the quarter s charge offs 
management observed that rising input costs such as plastic resins  steel and petroleum would impact certain segments of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio 
management also observed a higher level of nonaccrual loans from within previously identified criticized loan levels while the economy was in an early stage of recovery 
these observations led us to change some of the assumptions used in the corporation s allowance for loan losses methodology by shortening the historical period used for estimating loss migration factors which had the effect of more heavily weighting recent loss history in the portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of  million was reclassified from the allowance for loan losses to a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of the commercial loan portfolio in other liabilities 
amounts presented prior to december  have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments declined million from december  the decline was primarily related to the decreasing risk in the portfolio 
in addition  the provision for credit losses associated with the unfunded lending commitments was reclassified from the provision for loan losses to other expenses to conform to the current year presentation

table of contents interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy that provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies with trends in the financial markets and the industry 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that assets maturing within one year exceed liabilities maturing within the same period 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within one year  the corporation was in a liability sensitive position as illustrated in the following table

the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in 
table of contents market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits  and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on the corporation s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of december  immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in net interest income basis basis basis basis basis points points points points points december  december  modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by the alco department 
the alco department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg  savings  money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends  and repricing relationships 
table of contents reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
presented below is the corporation s eve profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in eve basis basis basis basis basis points points points points points december  december  earlier in the year  the investment portfolio cash flows were used to paydown short term debt as part of a deleveraging strategy of the corporation 
beginning in september  the corporation began to reinvest cash flows into shorter duration securities in anticipation of rising market rates 
the duration of the portfolio is as of december  as compared to on december  capital resources financial institutions are subject to a strict uniform system of capital based regulations 
under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at year end  the corporation  on a consolidated basis  as well as firstmerit bank exceeded the minimum capital levels of the well capitalized category

liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the corporation s treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of 
table of contents all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future month and identifying sources and uses of funds 
treasury group also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institution specific stress 
in addition  the overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system 
the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  borrowings through the federal reserve bank of cleveland s discount window  debt issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers

sfas requires that the liability be recorded at net present value while the future payments contained in this table have not been discounted 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the 
table of contents inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
critical accounting policies the corporation s most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has determined that accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  mortgage servicing rights  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and pension and postretirement benefits are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments 
application of assumptions different than those used by management could result in material changes in the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
accounting for these critical areas requires the most subjective and complex judgments that could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
as explained in note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for loan losses to these consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogenous pools of loans 
changes in economic conditions can result in significant changes to management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
the income tax amounts in note federal income taxes to these consolidated financial statements reflect the current period income tax expense for all periods shown  as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
the current income tax liability also includes management s estimate of potential adjustments by taxing authorities 
the income tax returns  which are usually filed nine months after year end  are subject to review and possible revision by the taxing authorities  until the statue of limitations has expired 
these statutes usually expire within three years from the time the respective tax returns are filed 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights is more fully discussed in note and note mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing activity to these consolidated financial statements and is another area heavily dependent on current economic conditions  especially the interest rate environment  and management s estimates 
the corporation uses discounted cash flow modeling techniques in determining this asset s value 
the modeled results utilize estimates about the amount and timing of mortgage loan repayments  estimated prepayment rates  credit loss experiences  costs to service the loans and discount rates to consider the risks involved in the estimation process 
derivative instruments and hedging activities are more fully described in note  note fair value disclosures of financial instruments  and note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to these consolidated financial statements
