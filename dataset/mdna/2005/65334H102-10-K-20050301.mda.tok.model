the above items and their possible impact are discussed more fully in the section  titled business risk management in item and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a 
the impact of any one risk  uncertainty or factor on a particular forward looking statement is not determinable with certainty as these are interdependent and management s future course of action depends upon our assessment of all information available at that time 
any statements regarding the following are forward looking statements o future crude oil  natural gas or chemicals prices  o future production levels  o future cost recovery oil revenues from our operations in yemen  o future capital expenditures and their allocation to exploration and development activities  o future asset dispositions  o future sources of funding for our capital program  o future debt levels  o future cash flows and their uses  o future drilling of new wells  o ultimate recoverability of reserves  o expected finding and development costs  o expected operating costs  o future demand for chemicals products  o future expenditures and future allowances relating to environmental matters  and o dates by which certain areas will be developed or will come on stream 
we believe that any forward looking statements made are reasonable based on information available to us on the date such statements were made 
however  no assurance can be given as to future results  levels of activity and achievements

within the meaning of the united states private securities litigation reform act of  section e of the united states securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the united states securities act of  as amended 
special note to canadian investors nexen is a us securities and exchange commission sec registrant and a form k and related forms filer 
therefore  our reserves estimates and securities regulatory disclosures generally follow sec requirements 
in  canadian regulatory authorities adopted national instrument standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities ni which prescribe that canadian companies follow certain standards for the preparation and disclosure of reserves and related information 
we have been granted the following exemptions permitting us to o substitute our sec disclosures for much of the annual disclosure required by ni  o prepare our reserves estimates and related disclosures in accordance with sec requirements  generally accepted industry practices in the us as promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers  and the standards of the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook coge handbook modified to reflect sec requirements  o dispense with the requirement to have our reserves estimates and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein  included in the supplementary financial information  evaluated or audited by independent qualified reserves evaluators  and o not disclose certain prescribed information pertaining to prospects if such disclosures would result in the contravention of a legal obligation  would likely be detrimental to our competitive interests or the information does not exist 
as a result of these exemptions  canadian investors should note the following fundamental differences in reserves estimates and related disclosures contained in the form k o sec registrants apply sec reserves definitions and prepare their reserves estimates in accordance with sec requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the us whereas ni requires adherence to the definitions and standards promulgated by the coge handbook  o the sec mandates disclosure of proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein calculated using year end constant prices and costs only whereas ni also requires disclosure of reserves and related future net revenues using forecast prices  o the sec mandates disclosure of proved and proved producing reserves by country only whereas ni requires disclosure of more reserve categories and product types  o the sec does not require separate disclosure of proved undeveloped reserves or related future development costs whereas ni requires disclosure of more information regarding proved undeveloped reserves  related development plans and future development costs  o the sec does not require disclosure of finding and development f d costs per boe of proved reserves additions whereas ni requires that various f d costs per boe be disclosed 
ni requires that f d costs be calculated by dividing the aggregate of exploration and development costs incurred in the current year and the change in estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves by the additions to proved reserves in the current year 
however  this will generally not reflect full cycle finding and development costs related to reserve additions for the year  o the sec leaves the engagement of independent qualified reserves evaluators to the discretion of a company s board of directors whereas ni requires issuers to engage such evaluators and to file their reports  o the sec does not consider the upgrading component of our integrated oil sands project at long lake as an oil and gas activity  and therefore permits recognition of bitumen reserves only 
ni specifically includes such activity as an oil and gas activity and recognizes synthetic oil as a product type  and therefore permits recognition of synthetic reserves 
given low year end bitumen prices  we have not recognized any proved bitumen reserves under sec requirements whereas under ni we would have recognized million barrels of proved synthetic reserves before royalties  and o the sec considers our syncrude operation as a mining activity rather than an oil and gas activity  and therefore does not permit related reserves to be included with oil and gas reserves 
ni specifically includes such activity as an oil and gas activity and recognizes synthetic oil as a product type  and therefore permits them to be included with oil and gas reserves 
we have provided a separate table showing our share of the syncrude proved reserves as well as the additional disclosures relating to mining activities required by sec requirements 
the foregoing is a general description of the principal differences only 
ni requires that we make the following disclosures o we use oil equivalents boes to express quantities of natural gas and crude oil in a common unit 
a conversion ratio of mcf of natural gas to barrel of oil is used 
boes may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation 
the conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead
