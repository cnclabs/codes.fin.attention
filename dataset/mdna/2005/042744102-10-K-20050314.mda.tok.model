for the second consecutive year  our net interest margin decreased  reflecting the industry wide trend that could effectively be offset only by growth and or new lines of business 
we continued to grow in  albeit at a diminished rate compared to prior years

results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin

for the change in net interest income from to  we experienced a decrease in net interest income of thousand  as the positive impact of an increase in average earning assets a million positive impact on net interest income was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in the interest rate environment a million negative impact 
the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes and the level of nonperforming loans 
key interest rate changes the federal reserve board attempts to influence prevailing federal funds and prime interest rates  in part by determining where to set the federal reserve bank discount rate 
the following chart presents rate changes in recent years primary credit federal date discount rate funds rate prime rate february  december  november  september  august  june  june  january  a november  december  november  october  september  august  june  may  april  march  january  january  may  march  february  november  august  june  a the discount window borrowing rate was discontinued in january and replaced with two rates  a primary credit rate and a secondary credit rate 
our net interest margin has traditionally been sensitive to and impacted by changes in prevailing market interest rates 
generally  there has been a negative correlation between changes in prevailing interest rates and our net interest margin in immediately ensuing periods 
when prevailing rates have declined  net interest margin generally has increased in immediately ensuing periods  and vice versa 
the following analysis of the relationship between prevailing rates and our net interest margin and net interest income covers the period from to the present 
as indicated in the preceding table  prevailing interest rates economy wide increased in the second half of and throughout  following a long period of flat or slowly declining prevailing interest rates 
the rate hikes had a moderately negative impact on our financial results for  as we experienced decreases in net interest spread and net interest m argin 
however  the full negative impact of rising rates was felt more sharply in  when the decrease in net interest margin due to rising rates was significant 
in the first quarter of  after an extended period of stable interest rates and six months of moderate rate increases  the federal reserve board began decreasing short term interest rates rapidly and significantly in response to perceived weakening in the economy 
by december  the total decrease in prevailing short term interest rates for the year was basis points 
for the following eleven months there were no rate changes  but the federal reserve board then decreased rates another basis points in november and followed with an additional basis point decrease in september as a result of this multi year decrease in prevailing rates  we experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits in all quarters of  which continued throughout  and into we also experienced a decrease in the average yield in our loan portfolio during these years  although the decrease in our loan yield generally tra iled  or lagged behind  our cost of deposits by three to six months resulting in higher margins and higher net interest income during the earlier portions of this declining rate period 
during and  the effect of the federal reserve s rate decreases on our deposit rates began to diminish  because rates on several of our deposit products  such as savings and now accounts  were already priced at such low levels that further significant decreases in the rates for such products was not practical or sustainable 
yields on our loan portfolio  however  continued to fall significantly in and  putting serious pressure on the net interest margin 
thus the decreasing rate environment had a positive impact on net interest income during and  as net interest margins increased both years  but for and the low rate environment had a negative impact on net interest margin 
the net interest margin for the full year of was  a decrease of basis points  or  from the prior year 
during the yields on earning assets fell basis points  while the cost of paying liabilities fell only basis points 
first quarter the net interest margin for the first quarter of was  an increase of basis points from the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of however  in the first quarter of  both the yields on average earning assets and the cost of paying liabilities decreased slightly from the fourth quarter of second quarter the net interest margin for the second quarter of was  a decrease of basis points from the net interest margin for the first quarter of yields on average earning assets decreased basis points from the first quarter  while the cost of paying liabilities only decreased basis points 
third quarter as the above table indicates  the federal reserve reversed direction in the second quarter of and began to increase prevailing rates with five successive basis point increases in the federal funds rate in  and one more  so far  in this change in direction did not immediately impact either our cost of paying liabilities or our yield on earning assets  both because of normal time lag in the responsiveness of such rates to federal reserve actions and for reasons unique to our portfolios 
the change in the mix of our total deposits in the third quarter of  reflecting our decision to de emphasize certain high cost municipal deposits  had a positive impact on net interest margin for the third quarter  which increased by basis points to from the second quarter 
the cost of all now accounts fell from for the second quarter to 
for the third quarter 
the yield on earning assets  meanwhile  only decreased basis points from the prior quarter 
fourth quarter generally  by the end of the third quarter of  the increases in the target federal funds rate started to have the expected impact on our net interest margin 
rates paid on new time deposits by the end of the quarter were higher than the rates on maturing time deposits 
our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  a decrease of basis points from the third quarter 
there was very little change in rates paid on average earning assets from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the fact that  in the aggregate  the cost of deposits and other borrowed funds was increasing faster than rates on earning assets 
we are not able to predict how long it will be before the recent increase in prevailing rates or any possible future increases may result in an increase in our yield on earning assets  or whether or for how long our net interest margin may continue to decrease  adversely affecting earnings 
however  the yield on our average loan balances for the fourth quarter of was only one basis point below the yield for the third quarter of in both rising and falling rate environments  we face significant competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace for our deposits and loans  and thus ultimately both assets and liabilities may be expected to reprice proportionately in response to changes in market rates 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets vs 
in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income  assuming a positive spread between the cost paid on interest bearing liabilities and the yield earned on interest bearing assets 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income offset by the million decrease due to changing rates discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  and an increase in average investment securities of million  or 
within the loan portfolio  the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio actually decreased by million  or 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom we acquire the dealer paper 
this decrease was more than offset by increases in the average balances of commercial and commercial real estate loans million  or  residential real estate loans million  or and other consumer loans million  or 
the million increase in average paying liabilities resulted from a increase in interest bearing nonmaturity deposits and an million increase in other borrowed funds  offset in part by a decrease of million in time deposits 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to an million  or  increase in the average balance on non interest bearing demand deposits 
vs 
during average earning assets increased million  an increase of 
average paying liabilities increased by million  or 
the combined effect of these changes in volume was to increase net interest income by approximately  before giving effect to the negative impact on net interest income between the two years resulting from the change in interest rates discussed above 
during  we experienced growth in our average earning assets primarily within the loan portfolio which accounted for approximately of the increase and secondarily within the investment portfolio approximately in comparing year to date average balances  the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio in was residential real estate loans 
while some of the segment growth represented extensions in connection with refinancing of existing loans  most of the growth was from new mortgage loans in the average balance of residential mortgage loans increased by over million  or 
commercial and commercial real estate lending represented the second largest growth area in the portfolio  expanding by over million  or 
the average balance of indirect consumer lending increased by over million in  or 
changes in the loan portfolio are discussed in more detail in the following section c 
ii 
loan portfolio 
the million increase in average paying liabilities in was experienced primarily in traditional banking deposit products  which increased by million  or  from the prior year  and secondarily in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  which increased by million  or 
the increase in deposit balances during was generated by our pre existing branch network  although glens falls national bank did open its twenty fourth branch in in queensbury  ny 
no other branches were added or acquired in changes in the deposit balances are discussed in more detail in the following section c

increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations 
in addition to the following discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for a description of our policy with respect to estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for the inherent risk of loss in the current portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
the determination of actual provisions for loan losses on an ongoing basis is largely influenced by the prevailing level of nonperforming loans  the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the prior periods  recent changes in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio and overall changes in the size of the portfolio 
vs 
at december   the quality of our loan portfolio remained strong and  to date  had not been negatively affected by the loan growth experienced in recent periods 
at period end  our ratio of nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans was 
the september  ratio for our peer group was 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end while we believe that the year end allowance of million was adequate under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  will not require increased provisions to the allowance or result in a higher incidence of loan charge offs 
the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from the provision was reduced  despite the growth in the loan portfolio  because asset quality indicators improved 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  virtually unchanged from the amount 
the result was a thousand  or  increase in the allowance 
because loans increased by a similar percentage during the year  our coverage ratio  allowance to period end loans was the same at year end as at year end 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for  down slightly from 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for our peer group at september  was 
of average loans 
if the current economic conditions should worsen  we anticipate that net charge offs may exceed the levels ex perienced in recent years 
vs 
at period end  the ratio of our nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans to total loans was 
the september  ratio for our peer group was 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from this reduction in the provision  like the subsequent reduction in  reflected general improvement in the portfolio quality indicators 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  virtually unchanged from the amount 
the result was a thousand  or  increase in the allowance 
because loans increased by a similar percentage during the year  our coverage ratio  was the same at year end as at year end 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for  down slightly from 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for our peer group at september  was 
of average loans 
vs 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at december   as compared to of nonperforming loans at december  during the second quarter of  we charged off thousand on one commercial loan 
disregarding this item  net charge offs for increased by thousand  or  over net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for our peer group at december  was 
of average loans  or higher than our ratio 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the decrease in was primarily attributable to one thousand commercial loan that was designated as nonperforming at year end  but was paid off in full during december while nonperforming loans and net loans charged off improved in  as compared to  the growth in the loan portfolio between the two years resulted in the provision for loan losses remaining consistent with vs 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the balance at year end the increase was primarily attributable to two commercial loans  totaling million  which were placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses dollars in thousands loans  net of unearned income years ended december  loans at end of period average loans total assets at end of period nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans construction commercial real estate commercial loans residential real estate loans consumer loans total nonaccrual loans loans past due or more days and still accruing interest restructured loans in compliance with modified terms total nonperforming loans repossessed assets other real estate owned total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of period loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential installment loans to individuals total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential installment loans to individuals total recoveries of loans previously charged off net loans charged off provision for loan losses charged to expense balance at end of period nonperforming asset ratio analysis net loans charged off as a percentage of average loans provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans  period end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans  period end nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets  period end iii 
other income the majority of our other ie  noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  computer processing fees and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income 
analysis of other income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gains on securities transactions other operating income total other income vs 
total other income increased thousand  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions  total other income increased by million  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end this increase reflected the general improvement in the equity markets during and substantial new accounts attributable to business development efforts 
income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in our proprietary north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the funds were introduced in march  and are advised by our subsidiary investment advisers  north country investment advisers  inc currently  the funds are owned almost entirely by qualified employee benefit plan accounts 
we also offer these funds on a retail basis through our bank branches 
included as an investor in the funds is our pension plan  which owns shares in the funds with a market value of approximately million at both december  and fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  insurance agency commissions  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  deposit account service charges and insurance commission income 
in november  we acquired a local insurance agency engaged in the sale of group health and life insurance 
see recent acquisitions on page of this report 
in  total other income included securities gains of thousand on the sale of million of securities available for sale 
the primary purpose of the sales was to extend and restructure the maturities of certain investments with shorter remaining lives 
the following table presents sales and purchases within the available for sale portfolio during investment sales and purchases in thousands available for sale portfolio st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter proceeds from sales collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total sales purchases collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total purchases other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income decreased thousand  or  from  primarily because we sold fewer loans into the secondary market in during  we sold million of newly originated loans primarily residential real estate loans to the secondary market 
the net gains of thousand were primarily due to the fact that we were able to write loans with yields slightly higher than those required by the secondary market 
by comparison  for  we sold million of loans for net gains of thousand 
vs 
total other income increased million  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions  total other income increased by thousand  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from  even though total assets under administration and management increased 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end however  most of this increase in market value occurred toward the end of  the average market value of assets under trust administration and investment management did not increase between the two years 
fiduciary account fees  in general  are tied to the value of assets under administration 
the increase in the market value of assets under administration reflected the general improvement in the equity markets in the second half of and substantial new volume attributable to business development efforts 
both the third and fourth quarter income from fiduciary activities for was above the respective quarters in income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in our proprietary mutual funds  the north country funds  described in the preceding section 
on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of transaction deposit accounts and the related service charges on those accounts and an increase in merchant credit card processing income 
for  total other income included securities gains of thousand on the sale of million of securities available for sale 
during the second and third quarters of  we experienced above average amounts of prepayments of mortgage backed securities and cmo s in the available for sale portfolio  many of which we had purchased in the markets at premiums at times when they had above market rates 
the higher than anticipated prepayment levels had the effect of accelerating amortization of the premiums an offset against interest income in the portfolio  ultimately reducing the yield on the portfolio below the projected yield 
the primary purpose of the sales in the available for sale portfolio was to extend and restructure the maturities of certain investments with shorter remaining lives 
the following table presents sales in the available for sale portfolio and purchases in the available for sale and the he ld to maturity portfolios during total purchases in the table below include million of asset backed securities purchased by us and secured by assets loans originated by our banks 
such securities are not  however  included in the total amount listed under purchase of securities available for sale in the consolidated statement of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements in part iii  item of this report  as our securitization of these loans and purchase of the asset backed securities was a non cash transaction 
investment sales and purchases in thousands available for sale portfolio st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter proceeds from sales collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total sales purchases collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total purchases for  other operating income increased thousand  or  from during  we sold million of newly originated loans primarily residential real estate loans to the secondary market 
the net gains of thousand were due  in part  to the fact that market interest rates on residential real estate loans kept falling during the period  but also because we were able to write loans with yields slightly higher than those required by the secondary market 
in  we recognized thousand in gains on the sale of loans 
the period also included a one time benefit of thousand from the demutualization of an insurance company for our group employee insurance trust and a thousand recovery related to the former vermont operations 
credit card processing income decreased by thousand from to as we completed our exit from this business in iv 
other expense other ie  noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of a company 
the key components of other expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of other expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense of premises  net furniture and equipment expense other operating expense total other expense vs 
other expense for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from one comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better is calculated as the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
excluded from the calculation are goodwill amortization and any net securities gains or losses 
for  the efficiency ratio for arrow was  a slight decrease from the ratio of 
our ratio  however  compared favorably to the year to date ratio for our peer group of as of september  for information on the calculation of our efficiency ratios on a quarterly and annual basis  see pages and of this report 
also see the discussion on page regarding use of non gaap financial measures 
 salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over due primarily to merit increases 
the increase in employee benefits from to was  and was primarily attributable to increases in nonpension postretirement benefit costs  as well as increases in health insurance benefit costs 
on an annualized basis  the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points less than the ratio for our peer group of at september  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of lease expense  depreciation and real estate taxes 
furniture and equipment expense actually decreased by thousand  or  from to the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in equipment maintenance costs 
other operating expense also decreased from to  by thousand  or 
the net decrease was distributed among a variety of categories of other operating expense

our ratio  however  compared favorably to the ratio for our peer group of  annualized as of september  salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over due to merit increases  as well as the hiring of additional employees 
this was offset  in part  by decreases in pension expense due primarily to our conversion to a cash balance plan and a decrease in the accrual for incentive compensation 
on an annualized basis  the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points less than the ratio for our peer group of  annualized at september  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of insurance  maintenance and real estate taxes

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
distribution of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential indirect loans other installment loans to individuals total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net indirect loans for several years preceding the third quarter of  the indirect consumer loan portfolio consisting principally of auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper was the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
over the subsequent quarters  this segment of the portfolio ceased to grow in absolute terms and decreased as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
this flattening out of indirect loan totals was largely the result of aggressive campaigns of zero rate and other subsidized financing commenced by the auto manufacturers in the fall of during the fourth quarter of  and for the first two quarters of  the indirect portfolio experienced a small amount of growth as we became more rate competitive  but the level of indirect loans was flat for the third quarter of and decreased by million during the fourth quarter of during  excluding the third quarter indirect loan balances continued to decline 
however  indirect loans still represent the second largest category of loans in our portfolio  and it continues to be the case that any developments threatening the indirect loan business generally may be expected to have a negative impact on our financial performance due to our reliance on such loans 
if auto manufacturers continue to offer heavily subsidized financing programs  our indirect loan portfolio is likely to continue to experience rate pressure and limited  if any  overall growth 
residential real estate loans residential real estate loans represented the largest segment of our loan portfolio at december   at of loans at year end 
this segment of our portfolio increased million from to  despite the fact that we sold with servicing retained million of low rate fixed rate mortgages during the year 
the period of strong demand for residential real estate loans  which began when rates started falling in  began to weaken in the third and fourth quarters of  as refinancing activity  no longer driven by falling rates  began to slow down 
residential mortgage demand remained moderate during  as rates stayed near  if not at  their record low levels of prior years 
during we sold with servicing retained million of low rate residential real estate loans 
the level of the portfolio was also impacted by the securitization of million of mortgage loans discussed earlier in this report 
in effect  the securitized loans were merely transferred to our securities available for sale portfolio 
we also securitized million of mortgage loans in commercial and commercial real estate loans we continued to experience strong to moderate demand for commercial loans in  a continuing trend that has persisted for several years  as commercial and commercial real estate loans have grown each year for the past five years  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio

many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlb or us treasury indices 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at cur rent rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
as noted in the earlier discussion  during the recently concluded long period of declining rates from mid to the end of june  we experienced a time lag between the impact of declining rates on the deposit portfolio which was felt relatively quickly and the impact on the loan portfolio which occurred more slowly 
the consequence of this particular time lag was a positive impact on the net interest margin during the beginning of the rate decline period  followed by a negative impact on the margin in more recent periods as the rate decline ended 
the net interest margin expanded during and into the first quarter of as deposit rates decreased rapidly 
our deposit rates began to flatten out in mid  while loan yields continued to decline 
as a result  the net interest margin began to contract in the second quarter of generally  this pattern persisted through the remainder of  all of and the first two quarters of  with the cost of deposits decreasing only slightly  if at all  and loan yields decreasing somewhat faster 
thus the yield on our loan portfolio decreased by basis points in the second quarter of  while the cost of our interest bearing deposits only decreased by basis points for the same period 
on june   the federal reserve board ended an uninterrupted four year period of falling rates with a basis point increase in prevailing rates  followed by four additional basis point increases in august  september  november and december due to the time lag between rising rates and the repricing of loan balances  the yield on our loan portfolio not only failed to rise  but continued to fall from the second quarter of to the third quarter of however  the decrease in the portfolio yield effectively came to a halt in the fourth quarter of as the yield dropped by only one basis point from the third quarter yield 
if rates continue to increase in forthcoming periods  as many analysts have forecasted  we expect that our cost of deposits will begin to increase  on average  while the yield on the loan portfolio may remain flat or even possibly decrease slightly for a time and then start to increase  with a time lag behind increases in the cost of deposits 
if so  we may experience further reductions in net interest margin in forthcoming periods 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of our commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
all of the real estate construction loans are for single family houses where we have also made a commitment for permanent financing 
maturity and repricing of commercial loans in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not then funded 
as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
b 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans we designate loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy  established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on accrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the table presented on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses  are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over thousand  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
nbs p  we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
during two commercial loans were considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
by year end  one of these loans was fully paid off with no portion of the loan charged off leaving  at year end  one impaired loan with a balance of thousand and a related reserve of thousand

at december  one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no 
with a recorded investment of thousand  an allowance for loan losses of thousand and a net carrying amount of thousand 
this loan was included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the decrease was primarily attributable to one thousand commercial loan designated nonperforming at year end  which was paid off by the borrower during december total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  a decrease from 
at year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans for our peer group at december  was  or higher than our ratio at december  during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing loans which may exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
because of this approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  we normally do not identify any significant number of potential problem loans in our portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above eg  nonaccrual  troubled debt restructurings 
at year end and  we had no such additional potential problem loans 
at year end we had identified only one credit that  although still accruing interest  exhibited such significant weakness as to warrant mention as a potential problem 
in we up graded the status of that borrower and no longer considered the credit to be classified as a potential problem loan 
the balance of other non current loans to which interest income was being accrued ie loans days past due as defined in bank regulatory agency guidance totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  thousand of residential real estate loans  thousand of commercial real estate loans and thousand of commercial loans 
the overall level of our performing loans  that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in our geographic market area was relatively strong in the period 
although the us experienced a mild recession in  which continued throughout and into  the economic downturn was not as severe in northeastern new york state 
in the capital district in and around albany and in the area north of the capital district  which are our principal service areas  unemployment remained below the national average

summary of loan loss experience we monitor credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate loans are reviewed at least annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of our loan portfolio and report on these examinations to management 
the boards of directors of our banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for probable loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook and financial condition and prospects 
in addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance  the provision for loan losses is influenced by the total size of the loan portfolio  the level of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance during prior periods and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses  presents a summary of the activity in our allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
since we regard the allowance as a general balance and has assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure requirements  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories 
on a quarterly basis  we risk classify delinquent or problem loans in the commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction portfolios as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
reserves are assigned to all loans by either a specific allocation  a risk classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of december for each of the years indicated

no other branches were added or acquired in the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type and the percentage of total deposits represented by each deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits we typically experience seasonally high deposit balances in the first and last quarters of each year due to the cyclicality of municipal deposits  which generally are included in either interest bearing demand deposits or time deposits of  or more during the period of very low interest rates  these deposits were primarily maintained in interest bearing demand deposits 
as is typical in falling rate environments  many of our depositors placed maturing time deposits in non maturity deposits  beginning in the third and fourth quarters of and into  and as well  presumably as a temporary investment pending a return to rising rates 
this was also true for our municipal depositors who maintained high balances in now accounts at both year end and our average deposit balances in the fourth quarter of were little changed from the fourth quarter of  due in part to our decision to take a less aggressive posture in bidding for certain municipal deposits 
the renewal of two large  high cost accounts totaling million reflected in interest bearing demand deposits in the table above was not aggressively pursued by us in the beginning of the third quarter of the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is shorter than the lag between federal reserve actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as a result of the federal reserve rate decreases in the through mid period  we experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits throughout the period 
the cost of deposits during the second quarter of was at its lowest point in many years 
after the federal reserve board began its recent series of rate increases in june  cited earlier  our cost of deposits continued to fall in the third quarter of as maturing time deposits were still repricing at lower rates 
by the fourth quarter of  the average cost of deposits began to rise 
we expect that this trend will continue until the federal reserve board discontinues its current series of interest rate increases  and perhaps slightly beyond that point due to the time lag in repricing deposits

liquidity liquidity is measured by the ability of arrow to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of our balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  we have supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
we have established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlb each in the amount of million at december  there were no advances under either line at december  if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
in addition  we have in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also have identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding accessible in relatively short time periods 
also  our lead bank  glens falls national  has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances outstanding at december  we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of cash flows from our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed securities  and from matur ing loans in our portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the increase in shareholders equity during primarily reflected million of retained earnings after dividends and million of new stock issued in november to acquire capital financial group  inc  offset  in part  by million of periodic repurchases of arrow s common stock 
in and we privately placed million each of capital securities issued by a subsidiary delaware business trust specifically formed for such purpose 
these trust preferred securities are reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these securities have certain features that make them an attractive funding vehicle 
under final rules  issued february  by the frb  trust preferred securities may also qualify as tier capital  in an amount not to exceed of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
both of our issues qualify as regulatory capital under capital adequacy guidelines discussed below 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item for a further description of our trust preferred securities 
at december   we redeemed a million issue of trust preferred securities originally issued and sold by us in the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to arrow and our subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for arrow  tier capital is comprised of common shareholders equity and the trust preferred securities issued by our two unconsolidated subsidiaries see the second previous paragraph  less intangible assets 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of arrow and our subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december  arrow and both of our subsidiary banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
the source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by arrow consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to arrow by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of arrow and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
due to the low level of interest rates at december   the downward shift was calculated using a basis point shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net inter est income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
however  during this period of very low interest rates we also may be adversely impacted by continuing declines in prevailing rates since there is very little likelihood that such decreases would be reflected in the short or long run by a comparable downward adjustment of deposit rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions in the second half of and early in that resulted in six basis point increases in prevailing rates 
we believe that continued increases in prevailing interest rates will have a short to medium term negative impact on our net interest margin and net interest income as well 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
