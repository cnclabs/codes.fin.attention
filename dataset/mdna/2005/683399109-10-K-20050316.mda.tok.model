item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business and additional business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview during  onyx had several important achievements  including a number of clinical developments for sorafenib formerly known as bay that we achieved with our collaborators at bayer pharmaceuticals corporation 
in the course of the year  we activated approximately sites internationally in our pivotal phase iii kidney cancer trial 
this trial is well underway  and we completed the patient enrollment phase of the study in march also during  we and bayer selected two additional indications  metastatic melanoma and advanced liver cancer  for which we announced that we planned to begin phase iii clinical trials in the first half of subsequently  in march  the two companies began the liver cancer study 
with bayer  we reported final top line phase ii results for kidney cancer patients who participated in the randomized discontinuation trial 
we and bayer also reported final phase ii trial results for liver cancer patients 
in periodic updates throughout the year  we also reported on the combinability of sorafenib with eight different chemotherapies 
also in  our collaborator  warner lambert company  now a subsidiary of pfizer inc  initiated a phase i clinical trial administering pd  a small molecule cell cycle inhibitor resulting from our collaboration that targets a cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk 
in accordance with our collaboration agreement  we received a  milestone payment from pfizer in october in february  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
also in february  the underwriters for the offering exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock to cover over allotments at a price of per share 
we received aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million from this public offering 
we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  due to expenses associated with the continuing development and commercialization of sorafenib 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the sorafenib clinical trials  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see additional business risks 
we currently have no products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues from the sale of products 
we do not expect to generate revenues  if any  from the sale of proposed products until at least and expect that all of our revenues  if any  before will be generated from collaboration agreements 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with 
table of contents accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in included assumptions used in the determination of stock based compensation related to stock options granted to non employees 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
stock based compensation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
research and development expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately percent in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
such amounts are recorded based on invoices and other information we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
in addition  research and development costs incurred by us and reimbursed by bayer are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue 
total revenue was  in  zero in and million in total revenue in both and included amounts received for collaboration revenue from warner lambert  now a subsidiary of pfizer 
in  we received a  milestone payment from warner lambert when they initiated phase i clinical testing advancing a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
our revenue was zero 
revenue of million in reflected research funding for the therapeutic virus collaboration that concluded in currently  we do not expect to record any revenue in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or percent  from in  the increase in research and development expense was primarily driven by a million increase in onyx s share of codevelopment costs for the sorafenib program  which expanded into the phase iii kidney cancer trial in the fourth quarter of in addition  sorafenib development costs reflect multiple ongoing phase ii clinical trials in breast  non small cell lung and other cancers and several phase ib clinical trials in combination with standard chemotherapies 
this 
table of contents increase was partially offset by a decrease of million of expenses from the therapeutic virus program  which was terminated in research and development expenses were million in  a net decrease of million  or percent  from the decrease in was primarily the result of the discontinuation of our therapeutic virus program  which decreased our research and development expenses by million from levels 
partially offsetting this decrease in was an increase of million related to onyx s share of the codevelopment costs with bayer for sorafenib 
it is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue with our clinical trials of sorafenib and as we add additional phase iii clinical trials of sorafenib 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and cost of completing a product development phase  see the additional business risks section of this report

sponsored research at the university of california  san francisco related to the preservation of the programs assets  and d 
outside services related to stability testing and storage of virus product related to the programs 
marketing expenses 
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  consulting and other third party costs  and allocations for overhead and occupancy costs 
we reclassified million from research and development expenses to marketing expenses for fiscal year to conform to the current period presentation 
marketing expenses were million in  a net increase of million  from the increase was due to third party costs and employee related expenses as onyx and bayer establish a commercial infrastructure and engage in precommercial marketing activities 
it is anticipated that marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we develop our marketing capabilities in order for us to copromote sorafenib with bayer in the united states should sorafenib receive us food and drug administration  or fda  approval 
marketing expenses were million in as compared to zero for marketing expenses in consisted entirely of onyx s percent share of precommercial marketing expenses incurred by bayer for sorafenib 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  and corporate functional expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or percent  from the increase was primarily related to  of consulting expenses for information systems  increased overhead and occupancy expenses of  allocated to general and administrative expenses  and  of costs related to satisfying the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of regarding internal controls over financial reporting 
general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of  or percent  from the increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate development consulting expenses and stock based compensation expense related to consultant stock option grants 
the increase to stock based compensation expense was caused in part by the increase in our stock price in compared with we anticipate that general and administrative expenses may continue to increase moderately to support our growing infrastructure needs 
restructuring 
prior to june  in addition to our small molecule program  we were developing therapeutic viruses that selectively replicate in cells with cancer causing genetic mutations 
in june  we announced that we were discontinuing this program as part of a business realignment that placed an increased priority on the development of sorafenib 
during  we recorded aggregate charges of million associated with the restructuring 
these charges consist of million related to employee severance benefits and million related to the early termination of a process development and manufacturing agreement with xoma us llc 
in addition  we incurred aggregate charges of million related to the discontinued use of a portion of our leased facilities and the disposal of certain property and equipment 
we reclassified  from property and equipment to other current assets for equipment held for sale at december  had this equipment not been reclassified to other current assets  we would have recorded an additional  of depreciation expense in in  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of  due to a change in estimate related to the discontinued use and inability to sublet a portion of our leased facility in richmond  california 
we expect that the remaining accrued restructuring costs of  at december  will be fully paid by the second quarter of when the remaining lease obligation on the facility is due 
there were no restructuring expenses in fiscal year interest income and expense  net 
we had net interest income of million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances resulting 
table of contents from our february sale of equity securities from which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds 
we had net interest income of  in  a decrease of  from  primarily due to lower average interest rates 
interest expense was immaterial for the periods presented 
other expense related party 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx  inc assets from our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays  compound libraries and certain intellectual property rights in exchange for preferred stock valued at  the entire amount was recorded as other income related party on the date of sale 
the value of the preferred stock was initially determined based on similar sales of syrrx preferred stock to unrelated third parties for cash 
in  due to a further round of financing completed by syrrx  we recorded  as other expense related party to recognize a permanent impairment in the carrying value of the investment 
in  based on a further round of financing completed by syrrx in april  we recorded an additional impairment charge of  as other expense related party to reduce the carrying value of the investment 
we consider the reduction in value of the syrrx investment to be other than temporary 
we did not record any write downs in at the time of the transactions mentioned above  a member of the board of directors of onyx was a director and officer of syrrx 
this board member is no longer an officer of syrrx 
other income 
in  we licensed assets from our small molecules discovery program to a third party for  this amount was recorded as other income 
no similar items were recorded in fiscal years and income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented and since inception 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million and for state income tax purposes were approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
related party transactions we had a loan with a former employee of which approximately  was outstanding at december  this loan bore interest at per annum  however  we had forgiven  of interest over the term of the loan through august this loan was repaid in august in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement 
in september  we announced that warner lambert initiated phase i clinical trials advancing pd  a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
as a result  we received a  milestone payment in october  which we recorded as contract revenue from a related party 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx assets from our small molecules discovery program in exchange for syrrx preferred stock valued at  we could also receive royalties on pharmaceutical products resulting from these assets 
at the time of the transaction mentioned above  a member of the board of directors of onyx was a director and officer of syrrx 
this board member is no longer an officer of syrrx 
in may  we issued and sold  shares of common stock in a private placement to a current shareholder and several new investors  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
a 
table of contents member of our board of directors is a managing member of domain associates  llc  one of the participants in the private placement 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in of million was attributable to our public offering completed in february  which raised aggregate net cash proceeds of million  as well as million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants and  received from the sale of fixed assets of laboratory equipment associated with our restructuring in these sources of cash were partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million primarily related to the move of our office facility from richmond to emeryville 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million in was attributable to our public offering completed in july and august  which raised aggregate net cash proceeds of million  the private placement financing that we completed in february  which raised net cash proceeds of million  million received from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  and  received from the sale of equipment 
in addition  we received a million creditable milestone based payment from bayer in december upon initiation of a phase iii clinical trial of sorafenib 
this payment will be repayable to bayer from a portion of any of onyx s future profits and royalties 
if onyx does not receive any profits or royalties on any products  onyx will not have to repay bayer any creditable milestone based payments 
these sources of cash were partially offset by cash used in operations of million and capital expenditures of  our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in in  the cash was used primarily for cofunding the clinical development program with bayer for sorafenib 
in  the cash was used primarily for cofunding clinical development costs with bayer for sorafenib and to fund development expenses including manufacturing and clinical trial costs for onyx expenditures for capital equipment amounted to million in   in and  in capital expenditures in were primarily for upgrades to our information technology equipment and leasehold improvements and furniture related to our move in december into our new corporate headquarters 
we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of up to million in we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon  together with approximately million in net proceeds from our public offering closed in february  will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through mid however  if we change our development plans  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
in addition  we anticipate that our codevelopment costs for the sorafenib program will increase over the next several years as the phase iii clinical trial program advances 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the cofunding of the program in future periods beyond mid we intend to seek this additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 

table of contents our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases  net of sublease income this table does not include any payments under research and development collaborations  as the amount and timing of such payments are not known 
this table also does not include the obligation to repay the million creditable milestone based payments that we received from bayer  because the repayment of these amounts is contingent upon onyx generating profits or royalties on any products 
whether onyx will ever generate any profits or royalties is not known at this time 
in  we entered into a new operating lease for  square feet of office space in emeryville  california  which serves as our new corporate headquarters 
the lease expires on february  when we moved into this new facility in december  we vacated our  square foot facility in richmond  california 
the lease for this facility expires in april  and we have no plans to renew this lease 
we also have a lease for  square feet of space in a secondary facility in richmond  california 
in december  we determined that we no longer required the secondary facility because of a reduction in force 
in september  the company entered into a sublease agreement for this space through september recently issued accounting standard in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas sfas r supersedes accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the income statement based on fair values of such instruments 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we would be required to implement the standard no later than the quarter that begins july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
although we have not determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net loss per share 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money manager  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months we did not hold any derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past 
however  our investment policy does allow us to use derivative financial instruments for the purposes of hedging foreign currency denominated obligations 
our cash flows are denominated in us dollars
