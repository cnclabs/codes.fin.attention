acquisitions we continually evaluate potential strategic acquisitions to increase the breadth of our proprietary product and service offerings and accelerate our revenue growth  enhance our margins and increase our cash flow 
since our initial public offering in  we have completed acquisitions 
the following is a brief description of the material transactions we have completed since january  on august  we completed an approximately billion combination with apogent in a tax free  stock for stock merger including the assumption of debt with a fair value of approximately billion 
apogent shareholders received million shares of fisher scientific common stock representing shares of fisher common stock for each share of apogent common stock they owned 
apogent is a diversified worldwide leader in the design  manufacture and sale of laboratory and life science products essential for scientific research and healthcare diagnostics 
the results of apogent have been included in the scientific products and services segment and the healthcare products and services segment from the date of acquisition 
on april   we acquired dharmacon for million in cash 
dharmacon focuses on rna technologies  including rna interference and small interfering rnai  which are tools for life science research that increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process 
the results of dharmacon have been included in the scientific products and services segment from the date of acquisition 
on march   we acquired oxoid for million in cash 
oxoid is a united kingdom based manufacturer of microbiological culture media and other diagnostic products that test primarily for bacteria contamination  with sales primarily outside of the united states 
the results of oxoid have been included in the scientific products and services segment from the date of acquisition 

table of contents on september   we acquired perbio science ab perbio  a swedish public company  for million in cash plus assumed net debt of approximately million 
perbio manufactures and sells consumable tools for protein related research and protein based biopharma drug production 
the acquisition of perbio enhanced our footprint in the life sciences market and increased our proprietary product offerings 
from the date of acquisition  the bioresearch and cell culture divisions of perbio  which accounted for approximately of total perbio revenues  have been included in the scientific products and services segment  and its medical device division  which accounted for the remaining of total perbio revenues  has been included in the healthcare products and services segment 
results of operations our operations are organized into three reporting segments scientific products and services  healthcare product and services  and laboratory workstations 
scientific products and services segment provides products and services primarily to entities conducting scientific research  including drug discovery and drug development  quality and process control and basic research and development 
this segment manufactures and or distributes a broad range of biochemicals and bioreagents  organic and inorganic chemicals  sera  cell culture media  sterile liquid handling systems  microbiology media and related products  scientific consumable products  instruments and equipment  safety and personal protection products  and other consumables and supplies 
additionally  this segment provides services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in clinical trials  including specialized packaging  over encapsulation  labeling and distribution for phase iii and phase iv clinical trials  as well as combinatorial chemistry  custom chemical synthesis  supply chain management and a number of other services 
healthcare products and services segment manufactures and or distributes a wide array of diagnostic kits and reagents  equipment  instruments  medical devices and other consumables products to hospitals and group purchasing organizations  clinical laboratories  reference laboratories  physicians offices  original equipment manufacturers and other distributors that service such customers located primarily in the us in addition  we also manufacture and distribute ear  nose and throat medical devices outside the us this segment also provides outsourced manufacturing services for diagnostic reagents  calibrators and controls to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries 
laboratory workstations segment manufactures and sells laboratory workstations and fume hoods and provides lab design services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers  colleges  universities and secondary schools  hospitals and reference labs 
sales the following table presents sales and sales growth by reportable segment for the years ended december   and dollars in millions sales sales sales growth sales growth sales scientific products and services healthcare products and services laboratory workstations eliminations consolidated 
sales growth of in was favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation of million representing points of sales growth and acquisitions completed in and that accounted for approximately points of sales growth 
our organic sales growth rate of approximately in was driven by strong customer demand in the scientific product and services segment  partially offset by 
table of contents slower growth in our healthcare products and services segment and a decline in sales in our laboratory workstations segment  as more fully described below 
consolidated sales growth of was favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation of million representing points of sales growth and acquisitions completed in and that accounted for approximately of sales growth 
our organic sales growth rate of approximately in resulted from revenue growth in all three segments as more fully described below 
scientific products and services 
sales growth of in was favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation of million representing points of growth 
sales growth impact from acquired companies in and represented approximately points of growth  primarily from apogent  oxoid and perbio 
organic sales growth of approximately was primarily due to strong demand from pharmaceutical  biotech and academic customers  as well as an improvement in our international markets 
in addition  the segment experienced increased demand for safety related products driven in large part by domestic preparedness and bioterrorism readiness initiatives  as well as increased demand from the us government 
we expect organic growth of in sales growth of in was favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation of million representing approximately points of growth 
sales growth impact from acquired companies in and represented approximately points of growth  primarily from perbio 
our organic growth rate of approximately was favorably impacted by an increase in demand for safety related products and was adversely affected by a decline in sales to our us biotechnology customers and a decline in international sales due to weakness in the european economy and associated reductions in research funding from governments 
healthcare products and services 
sales growth of in was largely due to the impact of the apogent and perbio acquisitions  which accounted for approximately points of the growth rate 
organic growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange each accounted for approximately point of growth 
our organic growth rate was negatively impacted in due to our efforts to improve operating margins at the expense of sales growth 
we expect organic growth of approximately in  reflecting flat to negative growth in the first half of the year with stronger growth in the second half of the year 
sales growth of in was largely due to strong organic growth which contributed approximately points of growth and approximately point from acquisitions 
the organic growth rate was primarily due to an increase in demand for clinical laboratory products in both the hospitals and reference labs customer segments 
laboratory workstations 
sales decrease of in was primarily due to the timing of large projects and a decrease in market demand for small projects 
this compares to a sales growth rate in that reflected strong demand in both large and small projects 
order activity for large projects was strong in  which is reflected in the increase in backlog at december  to million compared to million at december  laboratory workstations is a project based business which operates from a backlog  a majority of which may be shipped in less than one year 
delivery and installation of projects  which are driven by the timing of construction projects  result in a corresponding reduction in backlog 

table of contents income from operations the following table presents income from operations and income from operations as a percentage of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and dollars in millions income from operations as a income from operations percentage of sales scientific products and services healthcare products and services laboratory workstations eliminations sub total other charges inventory step up goodwill impairment restructuring charges credits  net other charges total consolidated 
income from operations in of million represents an increase of from as a percentage of sales  income from operations declined to of sales in from of sales in the decline in operating margins as a percentage of sales is due to million of special charges in compared to million of such charges in special charges in were comprised of million of inventory step up included in cost of sales for and acquisitions  million of goodwill impairment  million of restructuring charges  and million of other charges 
included in other charges is million of integration costs of which million is recorded in cost of sales and million is in selling  general and administrative expense  million of intangible and fixed asset impairment charges and a million contribution to our charitable foundation which are both recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
special charges in were comprised of inventory step up for acquisitions 
the impact of the increase in these charges was partially offset by operating margin improvements in both the scientific products and services and healthcare products and services segments as described below 
excluding the impact of special charges  operating margins increased to of sales in compared to of sales in income from operations of million in represents an increase of from as a percentage of sales  income from operations declined to of sales in from of sales in the decline in operating margins as a percentage of sales is due to million of inventory step up charges in compared to million of restructuring credits in excluding the impact of special charges  operating margins increased to of sales in compared to of sales in this improvement was due to increased operating margins in each of our segments as described below 
scientific products and services 
operating income in increased million from to million with operating margins improving to in from in the improvement in operating margins was primarily due to the impact of the oxoid and apogent acquisitions during these acquisitions contributed to an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales with a partially offsetting increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
organic operating margins improved slightly during which was partially offset by investments in sales and marketing activities and increased external and internal audit related expenditures 
we expect a continuing increase in operating margins in reflecting the full year contribution of apogent and the related synergy initiatives  as well as organic margin improvements from business initiatives and fixed cost leverage 
operating income in increased million from  with operating margins improving to in from in the increase in operating margins in was attributable to the impact of the perbio acquisition  continued 
table of contents improvements in international operating margins  partially offset by a decrease in sales volume to us biotechnology companies and increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives 
healthcare products and services 
operating income in increased million from to million with operating margins improving to in from in the improvement in operating margins was due to the impact of the apogent acquisition during along with strong organic margin improvement  which was partially offset by increased external and internal audit related expenditures 
apogent contributed to an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales with a partially offsetting increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
organic operating margin improvement was primarily the result of our focus on margin improvement initiatives at the expense of revenue growth 
we expect a continuing increase in operating margins in  reflecting the full year contribution of apogent and the related synergy initiatives as well as continuing organic margin improvement initiatives and fixed cost leverage 
operating income in increased million from  with operating margins improving to in from in the increase in operating margins in was primarily reflective of a broad based increase in volume for clinical laboratory products 
laboratory workstations 
operating income in decreased million from to million with operating margins declining to in from in the decline in operating margins was primarily a result of the overall decline in revenue during as a result of decreased market demand for higher margin small projects and the impact of increased steel prices 
we expect margins to remain relatively flat in operating income in decreased million from  with operating margins declining to in from in the decline in operating margins in was primarily the result of a one time order from the federal government completed in that did not repeat in interest expense interest expense in   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily attributable to the increase in debt in resulting from the assumption of debt upon the merger with apogent on august  and the issuance of million of convertible debt on march  to fund the acquisition of oxoid 
the decrease in interest expense in is attributable to our debt refinancing activities in and  and a decrease in the rate on variable rate debt 
other income expense  net other expense  net  includes the following for the years ended december   and in millions debt refinancing costs acquisition related foreign currency hedges fixed swap unwind costs interest income and other gain on sale of investment other income expense  net debt refinancing costs in primarily relate to third party costs incurred to refinance the debt assumed in the apogent merger and the write off of deferred financing fees and third party costs related to the fisher credit facility that was refinanced upon consummation of the apogent merger 
amounts in primarily relate to call premiums and the write off of deferred financing fees for the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and notes 
we recognized a gain in the fourth quarter of from the liquidation of our investment in procurenet inc procurenet 
procurenet is a former subsidiary that was spun off from fisher in 
table of contents income tax provision our effective tax rate in   and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in from was due to a million credit in due to the finalization of certain foreign and domestic tax audits and negotiations and a basis difference relating to the company s disposal of its investment in procurenet  partially offset by the effect of the merger with apogent 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in from was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings in as compared to as a result of reorganizations and integration efforts within the group that have produced tax savings 
cumulative effect of accounting change during  we completed our transitional assessment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas to determine if goodwill was impaired as of january  as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million million  net of tax in our statement of operations reflecting the cumulative effect of the accounting change to adjust goodwill to its current fair value 
the scientific products and services segment and laboratory workstations segment accounted for million and million of the charge  respectively 
the impairment charge in the scientific products and services segment related to certain of our smaller market international distribution businesses where operating performance was lower than originally forecasted 
our laboratory workstations segment is sensitive to changes in capital spending  and several of the markets to which the laboratory workstations segment sells  including the technology industry  experienced a significant economic slowdown causing a reduction in capital spending in those markets 
as a result  sales growth was significantly less than originally forecast  resulting in decreased profitability 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform the annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of october each year 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operating activities was million in compared with million in the increase in cash from operations in was primarily from an increase in net income as adjusted for items such as depreciation and amortization  debt refinancing charges  goodwill impairment and the gain on sale of investment 
accounts receivable provided million of cash in compared to a use of million in this change in cash from accounts receivable is primarily due to the impact of apogent in and improvements in collections 
the decrease in inventories provided million of cash in compared to million in excluding the rollout of the inventory step up of million in and million in  we invested million in inventory in compared to reducing inventories by million in the change in cash relating to inventory in is primarily due to an increased investment in inventory related to our life sciences entities  increases in inventory due to certain of our integration projects combined with a decrease in inventory levels at certain of our entities in that did not recur in cash generated from operating activities was million in compared with million in the increase in cash from operations in was related primarily to an increase in net income and continued improvements in working capital management  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in contributions to our pension plan and supplemental nonqualified executive retirement program 
we used million of cash for investing activities in compared with million in the decrease in cash used in is primarily due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions 
in  we acquired oxoid and dharmacon for cash and merged with apogent in a stock for stock transaction 
the cash acquired from the merger with apogent is shown as a reduction in cash used for acquisitions in in  we acquired perbio for cash 
in addition  included in other investing activities is million of proceeds from the liquidation of our investment in procurenet in and a million use of cash in to purchase 
table of contents options to hedge foreign currency exposures related to the perbio acquisition 
significant capital expenditures in included facility expansions at our clinical services business and perbio entities and construction of a manufacturing facility in mexico for our lab workstations unit 
we expect capital spending to increase in to approximately million which will include completion of the aforementioned facility expansions in  additional expansions related to the integration of select manufacturing operations and the transfer of production to lower cost facilities 
we used million of cash for investing activities in compared with million in the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to the acquisition of perbio and continued capital spending for our chemical manufacturing capabilities  our west coast warehouse that opened late in and spending associated with perbio facility expansions
