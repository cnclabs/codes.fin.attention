forward looking information the information contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended april  contains statements that we believe to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  believe  project  or continue  or the negative thereof or similar words 
from time to time  we also may provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and in any public statements we make could be materially different from actual results 
they can be affected by assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties  including those described below under risk factors and other factors disclosed throughout this annual report on form k and the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
consequently  we cannot guarantee any forward looking statements and undertake no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this annual report on form k 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
investors should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that might affect actual results and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
risk factors in addition to specific factors which may be described in connection with any of the company s forward looking statements  factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the following items 
reduced profit margins due to the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices 
the cyclicality of commodity chemical markets  such as caustic soda  primarily results from changes in the balance between supply and demand and the level of general economic activity 
the company cannot predict with any certainty whether the markets for its commodity chemicals will favorably impact the company s operations or whether the company will experience losses due to excess production resulting in oversupply and lower prices 
unforeseen liabilities arising from litigation  particularly liabilities that may arise from claims under environmental laws which may impose liability for the release of hazardous materials whether or not the company had knowledge of or was responsible for such release 
changes in governmental and regulatory policies that affect the company which may entail significant cost increases relating to the handling  storage  transportation  treatment or disposal of hazardous materials 
increased competition which could affect our ability to raise prices or successfully enter certain markets 
changes in customer demand which may significantly reduce revenues and income 
changes in product costs or operating expenses which may reduce our operating margins 
unforeseen problems in our ability to develop  introduce and gain market acceptance for new products 
the financial condition of our customers and their ability to purchase our products at comparable prices 
significant changes in our business strategies  including acquisition  divestiture and restructuring activities which may affect our ability to focus on operating activities or increase costs 
general economic and political conditions  such as political instability or the rate of economic growth in our principal geographic or product markets 
changes in operating factors  such as our ability to make continued improvements in distribution efficiencies and inventory risks due to shifts in market demand 
unforeseen or recurring operational problems or natural disasters at any of our facilities causing significant lost production and or increased costs 
since  flooding of the mississippi river has required the company s terminal operations to be temporarily shifted out of its buildings four times  the most recent being in the spring of this had a negative impact on earnings in the third quarter of fiscal of approximately  no assurance can be given that flooding will not recur or that there will not be material damage or interruption to the company s operations in the future from flooding 
in september  a million gallon caustic soda storage tank was completed at the red rock facility  allowing it to serve as an additional terminal for bulk chemicals 
historically  the property on which the red rock facility is located has not been subject to flooding when terminals and were not usable due to high water  and the facility was not affected by the most recent flooding in the company believes the impact of future flooding  if any  will be reduced as the red rock facility is expected to allow the company to continue normal shipping to customers during periods of high water levels 
technology risks  such as failure to successfully implement new technology that will allow us to make process improvements to reduce costs or to analyze the business 
loss of senior management or other key personnel and our ability to hire suitable replacements in a timely manner 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company made the determination to continue to use its current operating system through the end of fiscal and until the implementation of the company s enterprise resource planning erp system is complete 
management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls as of april  that is included in this form k was made on the current operating system and concludes that the internal control system was not operating effectively as of april  the company has remediated or is currently in the process of remediating the material weaknesses that led to this conclusion 
effective internal controls are important to the production of reliable financial reports and in helping to prevent financial fraud 
if  in the future  as a result of ineffective internal controls  the company is unable to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  its business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in its reported financial information  and the trading price of the company s stock could drop significantly 
these factors are not exhaustive and new factors may emerge or existing factors may change in a manner that impacts our business 
we assume no obligation and disclaim any duty to update the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k or any other public statement 
general the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the company s fiscal years ended april   march  and march  overall summary sales for the fiscal year ended april  were  versus  for the fiscal year ended march  and  for the fiscal year ended march  net income for the fiscal year ended april  was  or 
per share  compared to  or 
per share  for the fiscal year ended march  and  or 
per share  for the fiscal year ended march  return on average shareholders equity was for the fiscal year ended april  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  book value per share was at april   at march  and at march  the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to sales for the period indicated fiscal year ended april  fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses litigation settlement income from operations investment income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income sales sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to sales of  for the fiscal year ended march  sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to in the previous year 
all three operating segments contributed to the increase in sales 
industrial segment sales increased  or  to  water treatment segment sales increased  or  to  and pharmaceutical segment sales increased  or  to  the increase in the industrial segment sales was driven by improved sales along several product lines and an increase in the cost and selling price of caustic soda in comparison to the prior year 
during the fiscal year ended april  there was a decrease in caustic soda volumes sold  which was offset by increases in selling prices associated with increases in the cost of caustic soda 
although the water treatment segment was challenged by cooler summer conditions during the second quarter of fiscal in comparison to the prior year  sales increased due to increased volumes in existing product lines and successful expansion of existing product lines 
increased volumes along several existing product lines drove the increase in pharmaceutical segment sales 
sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to sales of  for the fiscal year ended march  sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to in the previous year 
the increase in sales in fiscal sales as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the water treatment segment  as sales increased by  or  in comparison to the prior year 
the increases were primarily attributable to volume increases  due in part to favorable summer weather conditions as compared to the prior year 
industrial segment sales of  were flat as the combination of an approximately increase in caustic soda volumes sold and an increase in caustic soda selling price that increased sales by approximately was offset by a decrease in sales to customers in the telecommunication and circuit board industries 
pharmaceutical segment sales of  were flat as compared to the prior year 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was for the fiscal year ended april  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
the gross margin decreases are due to a number of variables as explained below 
industrial segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the industrial segment was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  gross margins for the fiscal year ended april  were flat as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  relates partially to changes in the cost and selling price of caustic soda during these periods and to the high level of high cost inventory on hand at the end of the fiscal year s barge shipping season october 
the company attempts to maintain relatively constant dollar margins as the cost of caustic soda increases or decreases 
the cost of this product is normally subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
by maintaining relatively stable dollar margins  the gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product is increasing and will increase when the cost of the product is decreasing 
additionally  a highly competitive market environment prevented the company from passing on to its customers an approximately  increase in product costs 
also  insurance expense increased by approximately  or  and employee compensation and benefits increased by approximately  or water treatment segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the water treatment segment was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  was partially attributable to competitive pressures which reduced margins on several products 
additionally  due to the lifo method of valuing inventory  the margin was negatively impacted by higher levels and changes in product mix of inventory on hand as compared to the prior year 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the fiscal year ended march  was comparable with the fiscal year ended march  as the increase in sales  due primarily to favorable weather  was offset by higher operating costs 
additionally  in fiscal the company started to manufacture a product line internally that resulted in an increased product margin of approximately  offsetting this improvement in product margins was an increase in operating costs  including an approximately  or  increase in insurance expense and an approximately  or  increase in employee compensation and benefits which includes an increase in commissions paid to route salespersons for the increase in product margins 
pharmaceutical segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the pharmaceutical segment was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  the increase for the fiscal years ended april  and march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  related primarily to a better product mix 
general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were  for the fiscal year ended april    for the fiscal year ended march  and  for the fiscal year ended march  the increases were primarily attributable to  and  for the fiscal years ended april  and march   respectively  in consulting fees associated with the company s efforts to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and to the company s implementation of an erp system 
the company will continue to incur additional expenses  including expenses for additional staffing and outside professional services  to implement the erp system and continue meeting the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
litigation settlements in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company paid million to resolve a personal injury lawsuit encaptioned chavarria et al v 
hawkins  inc  panorama compounding pharmacy  and valley drug and compounding  et al that arose from the alleged mislabeling of certain inventory the company purchased in connection with its acquisition of st 
mary s chemicals  inc d b a universal chemicals in may pursuant to the terms of the settlement  the company denied all liability and reserved its right to pursue indemnification and contribution from third parties 
in july  the company filed suit in hennepin county  minnesota against the former principals of universal chemicals  seeking indemnification for the costs the company incurred in defending and resolving the prior litigation 
on june   the company and the former universal chemicals principals the defendants executed a settlement agreement in full and final resolution of the company s claims  as well as any claims the defendants may have or may have had against the company 
the settlement agreement requires the defendants to surrender to the company  shares of the company s common stock  which they received as consideration for the may acquisition 
the agreement also terminates the non competition provisions of the company s agreements with the defendants  relieving the company of the obligation to pay  to the defendants over the next five years as consideration for these provisions 
the settlement agreement calls for the parties to execute mutual releases and a stipulation of dismissal 
investment income investment income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended april  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily related to an increase in cash available for investment  and a higher rate of return on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the  increase in investment income for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  was attributable to an increase in cash available for investment and to a  loss recognized in the fiscal year ended march  due to declines in market value on investments which were deemed other than temporary 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended april  was comparable to the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes 
inflation inflation did not have a significant impact on the company during the fiscal years ended april   march   and march   as selling prices have generally been adjusted as the cost of materials and other expenses have changed 
on occasion  slight fluctuations in the cost of a single  large volume product have not been reflected in the selling price of that product 
selected quarterly financial data fiscal year ended april  unaudited first quarter ended july  second quarter ended september  third quarter ended december  fourth quarter ended april  sales gross margin net income basic and diluted earnings per share fiscal year ended march  unaudited first quarter ended july  second quarter ended september  third quarter ended december  fourth quarter ended march  sales gross margin net income loss basic and diluted earnings loss per share financial condition liquidity cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended april  was  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in the fiscal year ended april  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was due to the timing of liability payments and the million litigation settlement that was paid in fiscal these amounts were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  primarily as a result of the increase in sales 
the decrease in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was due to the decrease in net income  including the million litigation settlement  the timing of liability payments  and year over year variances in tax payments 
cash and investments available for sale of  at april  increased by  as compared with the  available as of march   primarily because of cash generated by operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments 
cash equivalents consist of money market accounts and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less 
investments available for sale consist of investment contracts with high rated  stable insurance companies  marketable securities consisting of corporate and municipal bonds  us government agency securities and mutual funds carried at fair value 
the company s investment objectives in order of importance are the preservation of principal  maintenance of liquidity and rate of return 
the fixed income portfolio consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk  and they generally mature within years 
the company invests in mutual funds with characteristics similar to the fixed income portfolio to enhance its investment portfolio diversification 
the company monitors the maturities of its investments to ensure that funding is available for anticipated cash needs 
at april    of available for sale investments were classified as non current assets as they were determined to be temporarily impaired and have maturity dates of one year or longer 
these investments were not determined to be other than temporarily impaired as the company has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow a recovery of fair value 
expected future cash flows from operations  cash equivalents and investments included within current assets are expected to fund the company s short term working capital needs 
as of april   the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of  and mutual funds of  excluding  classified as cash and cash equivalents and variable rate securities 
the fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
however  while the value of the investment may fluctuate in any given period  the company intends to hold its fixed income investments until maturity 
consequently  the company would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on net income or cash flows or the amount ultimately realized on the investment 
the value of the mutual funds  like all mutual funds  may increase or decrease due to market volatility 
the company recorded a loss of  in the fiscal year ended march  due to declines in market value that were deemed other than temporary 
the mutual funds held by the company as of april  consist of short term bond funds that invest primarily in investment grade securities 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended april   march  and march  were   and  respectively 
capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended april  consisted of  for office furniture and equipment primarily related to software and hardware data processing equipment associated with the company s implementation of an erp system   for machinery and equipment   for land  buildings and improvements  and  for transportation equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately million primarily related to implementation of the erp system  new route sales trucks  warehouse additions  and general maintenance projects 
common stock repurchases the company did not acquire any common stock during the fiscal years ended april   march   and march  off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period contractual obligation more than years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the company is committed to pay suppliers under the terms of open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
the company does not purchase  or commit to purchase  quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within one year 
outlook expected future cash flows from operations  coupled with the company s strong financial position  put the company in a position to fund both short and long term working capital and capital investment needs with internally generated funds 
management does not  therefore  anticipate the need to engage in significant financing activities in either the short or long term 
if the need to obtain additional capital does arise  however  management is confident that the company s total debt to capital ratio puts it in a position to obtain debt financing on favorable terms 
the company will continue to incur significant expenditures in fiscal associated with the implementation of the erp system and to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
fiscal expenses  including incremental information technology expenses and outside professional services  are expected to be consistent with the additional fiscal expense of approximately million 
although management continually reviews opportunities to enhance the value of the company through strategic acquisitions  other capital investments and strategic divestitures  no material commitments for such investments or divestitures currently exist 
other than as discussed above  management is not aware of any trends or other matters that have not materially affected results in the fiscal year ended april  but are expected to have a material effect on future periods 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the product has been shipped to the customer if there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the products  performance has occurred  the price and terms of sale are fixed  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
investments statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the general market conditions  including factors such as industry and sector performance  rating agency actions  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from customers located in the united states 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the age of the outstanding receivables and the payment history and credit worthiness of each customer 
management evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses the inventory quantities on hand to estimated future usage and sales and  if necessary  writes down the value of inventory deemed obsolete or excess to market 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization and property  plant  and equipment  when events and changes in circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal and state tax issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at april   the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of  mutual funds of  investment contracts of  and cash and cash equivalents of  the fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risks and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
however  while the value of the investment may fluctuate in any given period  the company intends to hold its fixed income investments until maturity 
consequently  the company would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on net income or cash flows during the holding period 
the value of the mutual funds  like all mutual funds  may increase or decrease due to market volatility 
the investment contracts are variable rate insurance contracts that reset on a quarterly basis 
a hypothetical change in rates would impact investment income by approximately  based upon the amount of variable rate insurance contracts held at april  the company adjusts the carrying value of its investments if an impairment occurs that is other than temporary 
the company is subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices 
however  the company does not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals
