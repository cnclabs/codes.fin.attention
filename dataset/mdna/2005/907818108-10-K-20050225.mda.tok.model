item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  and other information in this report  including critical accounting policies  risk factors  and cautionary information set forth at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable business segment 
the consolidated financial statements in and also include discontinued trucking operations  consisting of otc and motor cargo  which were subsidiaries of overnite  inc  formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of upc 
in  we reclassified our trucking operations as discontinued operations 
executive summary highlights safety during a year when we added many new crew personnel and moved record volumes  the number of new claims for lost work day cases declined by  and incidents reportable to the fra decreased by over 
the number of derailments for the year was flat compared to  trespasser incidents declined  while our grade crossing accidents were up slightly over as part of our continuing focus on public safety  we worked to reduce grade crossing incidents by closing numerous crossings  upgrading many others  training law enforcement officers  and educating the public about the risks associated with crossings 
in an effort to reduce derailments  we increased track inspections  employed new technology to identify car defects before failure  and implemented operating practice improvements to accelerate skill development and promote situational awareness with our train crews and yard personnel 
revenue growth we increased operating revenues by year over year to billion  the highest level in our history  as vigorous economic growth led to unprecedented demand for our services 
we achieved record revenue levels in four of our major commodity groups agricultural  automotive  industrial products  and intermodal 
the higher revenue was attributable primarily to additional fuel surcharges  better pricing yields  and increased carloads  and reflects our continued focus on our yield strategy 
the key components of our yield strategy are providing service that meets customer needs at prices that reflect the value of our services and achieving a mix of business that maximizes profitability 
resources we made substantial progress during to increase our train crews and locomotive resources 
through aggressive hiring and training programs  we placed into conductor service nearly  new trainmen  resulting in a net increase in trainmen  and trained nearly conductors to become engineers  a net increase 
in addition to hiring and training crews  we accelerated locomotive acquisitions to improve velocity  with almost new locomotives entering our system during  an increase of in our locomotive road fleet 
free cash flow we generated free cash flow of million in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities  less cash used in investing activities  dividends paid  and non cash capital lease financings plus non cash acquisitions 

table of contents free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure by sec regulation g 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid non cash capital lease financings non cash acquisitions free cash flow proceeds from sale of discontinued operations net free cash flow challenges energy prices energy prices were high throughout the year  increasing our operating expenses by million over however  our fuel surcharges offset over of these higher fuel costs 
our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover a portion of the increase in fuel expense from customers in the form of higher revenue 
network performance due to the unprecedented demand for our services and our resource shortages  we experienced operational challenges throughout our network performance and operating efficiency were initially affected in the latter part of by a shortage of trainmen and engineers and fourth quarter record level volumes 
during  we largely addressed our resource shortages by aggressive hiring and training of train crews  along with long and short term locomotive and freight car acquisition and leasing programs 
however  our record volumes consumed many of the resources we added  preventing us from improving operational efficiency and creating congestion in several key corridors 
in addition to adding resources  we also regulated business levels to reduce congestion 
our service issues  including increased hiring and training efforts  added approximately million in operating expenses during outlook safety in  operating safety will continue to be our first priority 
with our extensive hiring efforts  our approach to safety for our new employees incorporates training  communication  and quality assurance 
with respect to public safety  we will continue our efforts to upgrade and close crossings  improve visibility at crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public on crossing safety 
we will also continue our focus on derailment prevention 
revenue growth record revenue levels are expected to continue in we have established a target for year over year commodity revenue growth of five to seven percent 
we intend to manage total volume growth to one to two percent  and we are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups 
we expect the largest percentage increases in revenue from the energy  intermodal  and industrial products groups  and we should see steady but more modest increases in revenue from automotive  chemical  and agricultural shipments 
energy prices we expect that fuel prices will remain volatile throughout the year 
to help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings  we will continue to increase the amount of traffic subject to a fuel surcharge 
capital plan in  we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately billion 
these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors  remove bottlenecks  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer 
table of contents needs  build and improve facilities and terminals  and develop and implement new technologies 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures through cash generated from operations  additional debt financings  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  in addition to cash capital expenditures  we expect to acquire locomotives and certain other equipment through short and long term operating leases 
this focused capital plan is designed to assist in expanding capacity  improving network velocity  and facilitating revenue growth 
transportation plan in the latter part of  we initiated a comprehensive redesign of our transportation plan 
we expect to fully implement this new unified plan by the middle of the new plan is intended to simplify our operations  improve network velocity  and better manage the volume of traffic flowing on our network in the face of continued strong demand 
we are also using industrial engineering techniques to increase throughput and improve terminal processing 
california weather impact in early january of  a massive storm hit california and nevada 
our rail system suffered significant damage  resulting in the temporary shutdown of five of six routes in and out of los angeles 
two of those routes required extensive reconstruction 
embargos were instituted to restrict traffic to and from southern california and the las vegas area until service could be restored  while a number of trains were rerouted onto other serviceable tracks 
we are still assessing the financial impact of the storm 
although we have insurance coverage and are subject to a million deductible  we will not be able to finalize matters with our insurance carriers for some time 
results of operations millions of dollars  except per share amounts and ratios income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income diluted earnings per share income from continuing operations net income income from continuing operations as a percentage of operating revenues return on average common shareholders equity operating margin income from continuing operations income from continuing operations declined in due to higher fuel prices  a million after tax asbestos charge  higher operational costs associated with a slower network  volume related expenses  and wage and benefit inflation 
revenue growth of partially offset the higher expenses 
the decrease in income from continuing operations in was a result of higher fuel prices  inflation  network costs including expenses associated with increased volumes  lower gains from real estate sales asset sales included transactions with the utah transit authority uta for million pre tax and the santa clara valley transportation authority vta for million pre tax  and debt redemption expenses  which more than offset revenue gains  lower interest expense  and productivity improvements 
productivity is measured by both gross ton miles per inflation adjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles per employee 
operating revenues operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues 
other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the railroad  revenue from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment 
we recognize commodity revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period 

table of contents operating revenues increased million to billion in  compared to an increase of million in commodity revenue increased million in and million in the increase in was driven by the industrial products  intermodal  and chemical commodity groups  while growth in was generated by gains in the industrial products  agricultural  intermodal  and energy commodity groups 
average revenue per car arc improved to  in compared to a increase in  while revenue carloads increased and in and  respectively 
the increase in both periods was driven by fuel surcharges  price increases  and index based contract escalators 
we recognized million and million in commodity revenue from our fuel surcharge programs in and  respectively 
other revenue increased million in driven by increased passenger and subsidiary revenue  partially offset by a decrease in accessorial revenues 
in  other revenue improved million due to higher passenger  subsidiary  and accessorial revenues 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in commodity revenue  revenue carloads  and average revenue per car by commodity type commodity revenue in millions of dollars change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total revenue carloads in thousands change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total average revenue per car change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total agricultural the improvement was driven by increased demand for dry feed ingredients and the positive arc impact of longer average length of haul shipments 
corn and feed grain shipments also posted revenue gains as demand for these shipments to the pacific northwest improved 
revenue growth was also achieved through 
table of contents additional shipments for gulf export and wheat to mexico 
arc grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments  as well as price increases and fuel surcharges 
revenue growth in was driven by higher demand for gulf wheat exports and ethanol shipments 
revenue gains were also achieved through additional shipments of sugar beets due to a favorable crop in and canned and packaged foods resulting from additional  longer haul shipments from the west coast 
arc grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments  as well as price increases and fuel surcharges 
automotive revenue growth in was attributable to increased volume of both finished vehicles  primarily from international shippers  and automotive materials shipments 
this was partially offset by a decline in shipments for domestic manufacturers due to lower production levels and weakened sales 
arc was up slightly in due to fuel surcharges and the favorable impact of longer average length of haul 
revenue growth in was driven by additional volume due to market share gains for materials shipments  partially offset by a decline in revenues from domestic manufacturers  as the softening economy weakened demand for finished vehicles and forced production cuts 
arc was up slightly in  as price increases were partially offset by the mix impact of disproportionate growth in materials shipments  which move at a lower revenue per car than finished vehicles 
chemicals in  liquid and dry chemical shipments were up due to overall economic activity  led by intermediate chemicals and caustic soda 
soda ash  or sodium carbonate  which is an important raw material for manufacturing  moves increased due to strong domestic and export demand 
plastics showed increases in both carloadings and revenue due to an improved economy and a stronger export market 
arc improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves  increased shipments of high arc soda ash  and the positive effects of price increases and fuel surcharges 
in  reduced plastics volume led the decline in carloads as the soft economy combined with higher input costs caused producers to lower inventories and reduce shipments 
growth of market demand for domestic and export soda ash partially offset the decline 
arc improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves  driven by fewer cars in storage in transit  in addition to price increases and fuel surcharges 
energy in  overall volume was slightly down compared to record levels set in volume increased for business originating in colorado due to strong demand for western high btu coal 
supply constraints for eastern coal and imports will continue to increase the demand for western coal 
price increases and fuel surcharges drove arc improvements but were offset by the mix impact of shorter length of haul moves 
in  strong utility demand due to lower inventories in the last three quarters more than offset the absence of export traffic from the colorado and utah mining regions as japan was sourcing coal from other far eastern producers 
arc increased primarily due to index based contract escalators 
industrial products higher revenue in was driven by growth in lumber  steel  and non metallic minerals 
demand for lumber was driven by housing starts and continued low interest rates 
steel increased as strong global market demand limited imports and spurred demand for domestic steel 
arc improved due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and more high arc lumber moves 
revenue improvement in was attributable to government  steel  and lumber business growth 
the increase in government shipments was driven by movement of military equipment and ammunition in support of the war effort 
lumber positively impacted carloads  as housing starts and low interest rates continued to drive demand 
steel and scrap shipments also increased as the weakening dollar created higher domestic and export demand for us produced steel  augmented by market share gains 
arc rose due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and more high arc lumber moves  reflecting demand for building materials 
intermodal revenue increased in  driven by improved overall economic conditions and an increase in imports from the far east  as more domestic goods were manufactured or assembled overseas 
arc in improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases 
in  carloads were up due to strong imports and improved economic conditions  as well as the year over year impact of the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and warehouse union ilwu and the 
table of contents pacific maritime association pma  which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of arc in improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases 
mexico business included in the commodity revenue reported above is revenue from shipments to and from mexico 
this revenue grew to million in compared to a increase to million for business gains in were led by increased volume in the industrial products  intermodal  chemical  and automotive business groups  particularly cement  newsprint and wood fiber  liquid and dry chemicals  soda ash  and automotive materials 
revenue growth was also driven by an increase in agricultural revenues resulting from both higher wheat exports and beer imports 
a decline in export shipments of corn and feed grains  as well as a reduction in energy carloads  partially offset the increases 
growth in was led by market share gains in automotive materials shipments and increased revenue for agricultural products resulting from higher corn and meal exports  as well as increased beer imports 
operating expenses millions of dollars change v change v salaries  wages  and employee benefits equipment and other rents depreciation fuel and utilities materials and supplies casualty costs purchased services and other costs total operating expenses increased in due to higher fuel prices  an asbestos charge of million pre tax  higher crew and asset utilization costs resulting from slower network velocity  and volume related costs 
expenses in were also negatively impacted by wage and benefit inflation  additional training expenses associated with an increase in trainmen employment levels  increased depreciation expense  and higher casualty costs relating to a jury verdict upheld against the railroad for a crossing accident and a derailment in san antonio  texas in our service issues  including increased hiring and training efforts  added approximately million in operating expenses during operating expenses in were higher due to increased fuel prices  wage and benefit inflation  and volume related costs as well as higher operational costs resulting from a slower rail network in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
these increases were mitigated somewhat by lower depreciation expense  a reduction in employment levels  and cost control efforts 
cost control efforts are defined as focused actions to reduce discretionary spending and failure costs 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits the increase in was driven by wages and training expenses associated with an increase in trainmen employment levels  increased crew costs due to slower network velocity  inflation  volume related expenses  and severance costs associated with the relocation of various support functions to omaha  nebraska 
lower protection costs and performance based compensation expense for management partially offset these increases 
protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee s protected rate of pay 
an individual s protected rate is imposed by the stb for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements 
we also benefited from cost savings driven by a smaller non transportation workforce during the year 
the increase in resulted from the adoption of fasb statement no  accounting for asset retirement obligations fas  which accounted for million of the increase 
other drivers included inflation  volume related costs  protection costs  increased crew utilization costs due to a shortage of available crews in the third and fourth quarters  as well as higher pension expense 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  other 
table of contents specialty equipment leases  and office and other rentals 
expenses increased in due to an increase in carload volumes  which resulted in higher locomotive and car rental expenses  and longer car cycle times resulting from slower network velocity 
the higher locomotive expense includes additional costs associated with leasing short term surge locomotive power  which is more costly than long term locomotive leases  and the increased leasing of new locomotives  which are being utilized for the higher business volumes and to improve network performance 
car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system without changing its loaded unloaded status or having a new waybill issued 
conversely  expenses decreased in due primarily to lower rental prices for private rail cars  partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense and increased car cycle times driven by higher inventory of cars on the system due to slower network velocity in the third and fourth quarters of depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties  and other track material 
depreciation expense increased in primarily due to a higher depreciable asset base caused by higher capital spending in recent years 
the decrease was driven by the adoption of fas  as well as the implementation of depreciation studies approved by the stb  which resulted in lower depreciation rates in for certain track assets  partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets 
the higher depreciable asset base partially offset the favorable impact of fas and the depreciation studies in fuel and utilities fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel  utilities other than telephone  and gasoline and other fuels 
the increases in and were driven by diesel fuel prices  which averaged   and per gallon in   and  respectively including taxes and transportation costs  and higher gallons consumed on a year over year basis 
the higher fuel price in contributed million to the increase  however  approximately of these costs were recovered through our fuel surcharge programs and are included in operating revenues 
the increase in gross ton miles in and drove the higher fuel usage resulting in an additional million and million in fuel expense in each year  respectively 
the railroad hedged approximately and of its fuel consumption for and  in accordance with its hedging policy  which decreased fuel costs by million in and million in gasoline  utilities  and propane expenses increased million in and million in due to higher prices 
materials and supplies materials used for the maintenance of the railroad s lines  structures  and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense 
office  small tools and other supplies  and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included 
expenses increased in due to increased use of locomotive repair materials associated with maintaining a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties  additional freight car repairs  higher materials costs  and increased freight charges for shipment of company material 
conversely  expenses decreased in driven primarily by costs associated with track removal as well as fewer locomotive repairs  cost control measures  and a shift to more contracting of locomotive repairs  which resulted in a corresponding increase to purchased services and other costs 
the reduction was partially offset by higher costs for locomotive materials 
casualty costs personal injury expense  freight and property damage  insurance  environmental matters  and asbestos expense are included in casualty costs 
costs in increased due to the asbestos charge of million pre tax  higher personal injury expense due to a jury verdict against the railroad for a crossing accident that was upheld on appeal in  and costs related to a derailment near san antonio  texas 
these increases were partially offset by reduced personal injury expense driven by lower than anticipated settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in than previously assumed  in addition to lower expense for our insurance programs 
expenses in increased due to higher personal injury expense  insurance costs due to increased premiums  and expenses associated with destruction of foreign equipment 
destruction of foreign equipment expense is incurred when equipment owned by other railroads is destroyed while in our possession 
purchased services and other costs purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  state and local taxes  net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other 
table of contents railroads  transportation and lodging for train crew employees  trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers  leased automobile maintenance expenses  telephone and cellular expense  employee travel expense  and computer and other general expenses 
expenses increased in as a result of higher locomotive contract maintenance services  state and local taxes  relocation costs associated with moving various support personnel to omaha  nebraska  and increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume 
similarly  expenses rose in due to the drivers mentioned above in addition to higher contract related expenses resulting from the cost of track removal and joint facilities costs  which were up due to reduced haulage receipts and increased expenses associated with a new joint facility contract 
the following table shows operating income and non operating financial results for periods ended december millions of dollars operating income other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations operating income operating income decreased in as higher fuel prices  a million pre tax asbestos charge  resource utilization costs associated with sub optimal network operations  volume related expenses  wage and benefit inflation  training expenses  and higher casualty costs more than offset annual revenue growth of 
our service issues  including increased hiring and training efforts  added approximately million in operating expenses during operating income in declined as productivity gains and lower depreciation expense were more than offset by higher fuel prices  inflation  volume  and resource utilization costs experienced in the third and fourth quarters of non operating items other income the improvement in other income was a result of higher costs in associated with the early retirement of billion of convertible preferred securities cps and income recognized in from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary  which were partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales in the reduction in was primarily a result of higher real estate gains transactions included sales to the utah transit authority with a pre tax value of million and the santa clara valley transit authority with a pre tax value of million and the negative impact of the cps redemption costs 
interest expense the improvement in interest expense in and was primarily due to declining weighted average debt levels of billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively  which included the cps in and our effective interest rate was in  compared to and in and  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense decreased in  driven by lower pre tax income  a reduction in the deferred state income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to omaha  nebraska  state income tax credits earned in connection with the new headquarters building in omaha  and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the passage of the american jobs creation act of the decrease in was driven by lower pre tax income  which was partially offset by a tax adjustment recognized in for prior years income tax examinations 
our effective tax rate decreased to in compared to and in and  respectively 

table of contents discontinued operations on november   we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest 
revenues from discontinued operations were billion and billion in and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations was million and million in and income from discontinued operations in included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of million  including an income tax benefit of million 
other operating and financial statistics railroad performance measures we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the american association of railroads  including carloads  average train speed  average daily inventory of rail cars on our system  and average terminal dwell time  which is a measure of the average time a rail car spends in hours at our terminals

other operating statistics gross ton miles billions revenue ton miles billions average full time equivalent employees gross and revenue ton miles gross and revenue ton miles increased and respectively in driven by carloading growth of during the same period 
gross and revenue ton miles both increased in with carloading growth of 
the increase in gross and revenue ton miles in was positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals  combined with a minimal increase in automotive carloads  which is a lower density commodity 
gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of a loaded or empty freight car by the number of actual miles hauled 
revenue ton miles are based on tariff miles and do not include the weight of the freight car 
average full time equivalent employees the increase in the average number of full time equivalent employees resulted from the addition of train crew personnel  who were hired to handle increased customer demand and improve service 
these additions were partially offset by increased productivity in the non transportation functions  employee attrition  and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries 
in  the number of full time equivalent employees decreased due to productivity improvements and employee attrition 
other financial statistics debt to capital lease adjusted debt to capital debt to capital lease adjusted debt to capital debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity 
lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total debt plus equity plus the net present value of operating leases 
we believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital 
the improvement in our debt to capital ratio resulted from an increase in equity due to earnings  partially offset by an increase in our debt levels since year end the increase in lease adjusted debt to capital was driven by higher debt levels and valuation of operating leases  which were partially offset by higher equity 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  the sale of receivables  and our revolving credit facilities  as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of credit facilities available  of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating 
if our credit rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the program was million as of december  access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
at december  and  we had a working capital deficit of million and million  respectively 
a working capital deficit is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
financial condition cash flows millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and temporary investments cash provided by operating activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was driven by lower income from continuing operations and cash from discontinued operations recognized in  which was partially offset by working capital performance 
the increase from to was due to working capital performance and higher cash from the discontinued operations  partially offset by lower income from continuing operations 
cash used in investing activities the increase in resulted from million received in for the sale of our trucking interest  a large dividend from an affiliate in  and reduced asset sales in the reduction in use of cash in was primarily driven by proceeds of million from the sale of our trucking interest  which was partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales and increased capital spending 
cash used in financing activities the decrease in was driven by lower debt repayments of million in compared to billion in including billion of cps partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises million in compared to million in and higher dividend payments million in versus million in 
the increase in reflects higher debt repayments of billion in including billion of cps compared to billion in  and higher dividend payments  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
the table below details capital expenditures for the years ended december    and  including non cash capital lease financings of million and million in and  respectively 
there were no non cash capital lease financings in capital expenditures millions of dollars track locomotives freight cars facilities and other total 
table of contents in  we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately billion 
these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors  remove bottlenecks  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs  build and improve facilities and terminals  and develop and implement new technologies 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures through cash generated from operations  additional debt financings  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for in addition to cash capital expenditures  we expect to acquire locomotives and certain other equipment through short and long term operating leases 
for the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
the decline in our ratio was due primarily to lower income from continuing operations 
financing activities credit facilities on december   we had billion in revolving credit facilities available  including billion under a day revolving facility expiring in march and billion under a year facility expiring in march collectively  the facilities 
the facilities  which were entered into during march  are designated for general corporate purposes and replaced a million day revolving credit facility that expired in march and a billion year revolving credit facility  which was due to expire in march neither of the facilities were drawn as of december  commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers 
like the revolving credit facilities that were replaced  these facilities allow for borrowings at floating libor based rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral 
the facilities require the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to net worth coverage ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
to the extent we have long term credit facilities available  we have reclassified certain short term debt to a long term basis 
at december  and  approximately million and million of short term borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as long term debt 
this reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis through the issuance of commercial paper or new long term financings  or by using the currently available long term credit facility if alternative financing is not available 
we are reviewing rollover options for the day credit facility that expires in march dividend restrictions retained earnings available for dividends decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   due to revisions in minimum net worth requirements under the credit facilities referred to above 
we do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings on may   we issued the remaining million available under a shelf registration statement filed in we issued fixed rate debt with a maturity of may  also on may   we issued million of fixed rate debt with a maturity of may   under a billion shelf registration statement filed in on november   we issued an additional million of fixed rate debt with a maturity of january  under the shelf registration statement 
the proceeds from the issuances were used for the repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes 
under the shelf registration statement  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
at december   we had million remaining for issuance under the shelf registration statement 
we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities  however  we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration 

table of contents operating lease activities as of december   our total aggregate contractual obligations for operating leases were approximately billion 
during  the railroad entered into long term operating lease arrangements covering new locomotives 
these new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately million 
the lessors of the locomotives were investors that purchased the locomotives in various transactions for a total equipment cost of approximately million 
the railroad also entered into similar long term operating lease arrangements for freight cars with a total equipment cost of approximately million and minimum total rent payments of approximately million 
the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars  in part  by the issuance of equipment notes that are non recourse to us and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the equipment 
neither the railroad nor upc guarantees payment of the equipment notes 
the railroad s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
we have certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars 
additionally  we have flexible return rights with respect to a portion of the locomotives 
if we do not exercise any such options or flexible return rights  the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 
on october   the railroad completed the refinancing of a new headquarters building in omaha  nebraska  with a synthetic lease  which is an off balance sheet financing arrangement as discussed below 
the lease has a term of years with total scheduled lease payments of approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
however  based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
in addition  the commercial obligations  financings  and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations  particularly within the transportation industry

the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was million at december  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million at both december  and december  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by  million and  million of accounts receivable held by upri at december  and december   respectively 
at december  and december   the value of the interest retained by upri was million and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point  the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by million 
should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad has been designated to service the sold receivables  however  no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used such proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million  and million for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
the costs include interest  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad have no recourse to the assets of upri 
on august   the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional day period without any significant changes in terms 
headquarters building on october   the railroad completed the refinancing of the synthetic lease for the new headquarters building 
the railroad will lease the building pursuant to an operating lease with a term of ten years 
total scheduled lease payments during the term are approximately million 
upc has guaranteed the obligations of the railroad under the lease and  therefore  has a contingent liability for such obligations 
the obligations of the railroad to make lease payments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements of 
table of contents the railroad or upc 
during the term of the lease  the railroad may  at its option  purchase the building 
such purchase amount  which was million  will represent the cost of constructing the building  including capitalized interest and transaction expenses 
any such payment may also include an additional make whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding debt  which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment 
upon expiration of the lease term  if the railroad does not purchase the building or renew the lease  the building will be remarketed 
the railroad has guaranteed that the building will have a residual value equal to at least million in the event that the building is remarketed 
therefore  the guarantee made by upc with respect to the railroad s obligations under the lease is expected to represent a contingent obligation of approximately million 
at december   the railroad had a liability of approximately million related to the fair value of this guarantee 
the arrangement is subject to customary default provisions  including  without limitation  those relating to payment defaults under the lease and the operative documents  the acceleration of certain other unrelated debt obligations of the railroad or upc  performance defaults  and events of bankruptcy 
in the event that such defaults occur and are continuing  the railroad or upc pursuant to its guarantee may be required to pay all amounts due under the lease through the end of the term of the lease 
other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows 
the use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements 
the purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december   we have not been required to provide collateral  nor have we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 
in addition  we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral 
the collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor 
we generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults 
determination of fair value the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december  and were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate  london interbank offered rates libor  or swap spread 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

table of contents interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
the mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required 
derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt representing approximately and  respectively  of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
the swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges using the short cut method as allowed by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore  no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our consolidated financial statements 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap on million of debt with a maturity of april  as of december  and  we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to approximately million at december  market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   amounted to approximately million at december  the fair values of our fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate cash flow hedges in may  in anticipation of a future lease transaction  we entered into treasury lock transactions with notional amounts totaling million and an average locked in rate of 
the treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
on september   the treasury locks were settled in connection with a year operating lease  commencing on october   and maturing on september  the settlement of these treasury lock transactions was based on a treasury yield of and resulted in a payment of million to our counterparty that is being amortized to rent expense over the life of the year operating lease 
as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
fuel cash flow hedges fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
in and  our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge program 
however  we may use swaps  collars  futures and or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 
we currently have no fuel hedges in place for as of december   collars were in place for of expected fuel consumption for the collars had a floor of  a cap of  and a ceiling of per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs  and regional pricing spreads 
based on annualized fuel consumption during  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately million of additional fuel expense  after tax 
as of december   we hedged approximately of our forecasted fuel consumption using fuel swaps at per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs  and regional pricing spreads 
accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
this statement  which is effective for the corporation beginning july   requires that companies recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share based payments 
we anticipate the impact of this pronouncement will not differ materially from what has been disclosed in our pro 
table of contents forma net income located in our significant accounting policies section of the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements  item asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos 
additionally  we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated 
the claims and lawsuits collectively referred to as claims allege occupational illness resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products 
in most cases  the claimants do not have credible medical evidence of physical impairment resulting from the alleged exposures 
additionally  most claims filed against us do not specify an amount of alleged damages 
the greatest potential for asbestos exposure in the railroad industry existed while steam locomotives were used 
the railroad industry  including uprr and its predecessors  phased out steam locomotives in approximately the use of asbestos containing products in the railroad industry was substantially reduced after steam locomotives were discontinued  although it was not completely eliminated 
some asbestos containing products were still manufactured in the building trade industry and were used in isolated component parts on locomotives and railroad cars during the s and s 
by the early s  manufacturers of building materials and locomotive component parts developed non asbestos alternatives for their products and ceased manufacturing asbestos containing materials 
prior to  we concluded it was not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of disposing of asbestos related claims that might be filed against us in the future  due to a lack of sufficient comparable history from which to reasonably estimate unasserted asbestos related claims 
as a result  we recorded a liability for asbestos related claims only when the claims were asserted 
we believe we can now reasonably estimate a liability for unasserted asbestos related claims because we have sufficient comparable loss data and there is no immediate legislative solution to asbestos litigation 
during we engaged a third party expert with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing the number and value of these unasserted claims through  based on our average claims experience over a multi year period 
as a result  we increased our liability for asbestos related claims to million 
at december   million was classified as current liabilities  while the remainder was classified as long term accrued casualty costs 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims 
these claims are expected to be paid out over the next years 
a summary of asbestos related claims activity in recent years follows year ended december  millions of dollars pending claims  beginning of year new claims filed claims settled dismissed pending claims  end of year payments aggregate payments to settle asbestos related claims we have insurance coverage that reimburses us for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos related claims 
at december   we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries 
we believe that our liability for asbestos related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment  federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants  and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 

table of contents commitments and contingencies various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos 
additionally  we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated 
a liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos related claims through has been estimated and recorded 
a third party expert with experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims assisted us in assessing our potential liability 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the number of claims received in will be consistent with average claims received between and the number of claims to be filed against us will decline each year after the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to those experienced between and the percentage of claims dismissed between and will continue through as a result of the assessment for unasserted asbestos related claims  we increased our liability for asbestos related claims to million 
at december   million was classified as current liabilities  while the remainder was classified as long term accrued casualty costs 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims 
these claims are expected to be paid out over the next years 
we have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos related claims and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries 
we believe that our liability for asbestos related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment  federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants  and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 
environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we have identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the 
table of contents us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in the conduct of our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
environmental expense for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we had a liability of million and million  respectively  accrued for future environmental costs  of which million and million  respectively  were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
compensation for work related accidents is governed by the federal employers liability act fela 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
annual expenses for our personal injury related events were million in  million in  and million in as of december  and  we had a liability of million and million accrued for future personal injury costs  respectively  of which million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years 
changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury cases 
depreciation the railroad industry is capital intensive 
properties are carried at cost 
provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group  based on the results of a depreciation study 
we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property to the stb for review and approval 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation  and no gain or loss is recognized 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition 
the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
an obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis 
capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets 
cash capital spending totaled billion for the year ended december  in  we implemented depreciation studies  approved by the stb  resulting in lower depreciation expense of million for the year ended december   due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets effective january   partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets effective july  
for the year ended december   depreciation expense was billion 
various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets  variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would 
table of contents decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part on management s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events 
based on that analysis  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain deferred tax assets as of december  pension and other postretirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for other postretirement benefits  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions

table of contents risk factors we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers we are subject to competition from other railroads  which operate parallel routes in many of our traffic corridors  in addition to motor carriers and  to a lesser extent  ships  barges  and pipelines 
competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing  as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system  trucks and barges are able to use public rights of way maintained by public entities 
any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate  or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
we have experienced service difficulties  which may continue due to unprecedented demand for rail service  a shortage of train personnel and locomotives  and capacity constraints  we have experienced network difficulties  including congestion and reduced velocity on our system  which have compromised the level of service we provide to our customers in a competitive environment 
although we have taken steps to correct these difficulties  including hiring and training employees for train service  acquiring equipment  and the ongoing redesign of our transportation plan to better manage traffic on our system  we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address our service difficulties 
we also cannot be sure that we will not experience other difficulties related to network capacity  dramatic and unplanned increases of demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups  or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal  state  and local authorities covering a variety of health  safety  labor  environmental as discussed below  and other matters 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our business 
economic re regulation of the rail industry would negatively impact our ability to determine prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on our rail network  resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
also  some laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits  and other authorizations  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to do so 
in addition  one or more consolidations of class i railroads could lead to future re regulation of the rail industry 
rising fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our business fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses 
diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations 
significant price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
additionally  fuel prices and supplies are affected by international  political  and economic circumstances 
if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports  or otherwise  higher fuel prices could  despite our fuel surcharge programs  materially affect our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity 
we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations our operations are subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  handling  storage  transportation  and disposal of waste and other materials  and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
we generate and transport hazardous and non hazardous waste in our current operations  and we did so in our former operations 
environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties  leased properties  and properties owned by third parties  as well as to properties currently owned and used by us 
environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation 
we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated  or are strictly liable under  these laws or regulations 
although we have appropriately recorded current and long term liabilities for known future environmental costs  we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing  and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known  unknown  or future environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 

table of contents the majority of our employees belong to labor unions  and labor agreements  strikes  or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states 
under the collective bargaining round that began on november   of the major rail unions reached new labor agreements 
we are currently negotiating new agreements with the remaining three unions 
on november   notices for the next round of negotiations were sent to all unions by the national railway labor conference on behalf of uprr and other carriers in the conference 
these legal notices state our desire to modify the current collective bargaining agreements 
disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages  or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage  or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
additionally  future national labor agreements  or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements  could significantly increase our costs for healthcare  wages  and other benefits  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations changes in demographics  training requirements  and the availability of qualified personnel  particularly engineers and trainmen  could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service 
unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks  which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
we may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity 
we utilize capital markets we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements  including the issuance of commercial paper from time to time and the sale of certain of our receivables 
market instability or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade  which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the cost of issuing debt 
we are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment and its production  there are high barriers of entry to potential new suppliers 
therefore  if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives  we could experience a significant cost increase and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 
we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business 
if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology  we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
additionally  if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems  including computer hardware  software  and communications equipment  we could experience a service interruption  safety failure  security breach  or other operational difficulties  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena  including earthquakes  fires  and floods  may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs  increased liabilities  and decreased revenues  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity 
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment  
table of contents personal injury  property damage  environmental  and other matters 
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of property damage  personal injury  and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity 
we may be affected by acts of terrorism  war  or risk of war our rail lines  facilities  and equipment  including rail cars carrying hazardous materials  which we are required to transport under federal law  could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks 
any terrorist attack  or other similar event  any government response thereto  and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity
