management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company rtw  inc rtw and its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  american compensation insurance company acic  provide disability management services to employers 
collectively  we  our and us refer to these entities in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we developed two proprietary management systems i id  designed to identify early on those injured employees who are likely to become inappropriately dependent on disability system benefits  including workers compensation  and ii the rtw solution  designed to lower employers disability system costs and return injured employees to work as soon as reasonably possible 
we provide disability management services  primarily workers compensation management services to i employers insured through our insurance subsidiary  ii self insured employers on a fee for service basis  iii the minnesota workers compensation assigned risk plan on a percent of premium basis  iv other insurance companies  and v on a consulting basis to agents and employers  charging hourly fees 
during  we operated primarily in minnesota  michigan and colorado and began servicing non insurance customers in california and indiana 
on march   our am best financial rating was upgraded from b fair  vulnerable to b very good  secure as a result of i our continued profitable operating performance in  and ii improved capitalization in acic as statutory surplus increased to million at december  from million at december  due to our earnings 
although we believe that our b rating from am best may increase the number of employers willing to do business with acic  there are some employers that will only consider insurers rated a or better

challenges  risks  uncertainties and trends we derive our revenue almost entirely from workers compensation insurance premiums and investment income  including gains and losses from sales of securities 
a small  but increasing portion of our revenue is derived from non insurance disability management services 
we are subject to the challenges  risks  uncertainties and trends that affect the workers compensation property and casualty insurance and the disability management services sectors of our economy including the following workers compensation is a state regulated industry 
workers compensation is governed and regulated by state governmental agencies 
we are subject to state regulation in any state in which we provide workers compensation products and services  now and in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our business  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change and any change may adversely affect our operations  workers compensation claims and related expenses can be volatile 
workers compensation is a long tailed property and casualty insurance line 
claims for a given year are open on average for twelve to thirteen years and it is not unusual for workers compensation insurers to have some claims open for thirty or more years 
we have operated acic since and therefore have relatively limited experience thirteen years  and accordingly  are subject to volatility 
see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses  workers compensation is subject to inflationary pressures 
worker s compensation is subject to both medical and wage inflation 
the cost of medical care has increased in excess of per annum in recent years 
this has resulted in reduced profitability in the workers compensation insurance line 

table of contents new medical procedures could evolve and new legal theories develop that could cause older claims to re open and increase expense 
see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses  workers compensation pricing is cyclical 
in  we were able to increase premium rates on renewing policies only by an average of  decreasing significantly from recent years 
rates increased   and in   and  respectively 
these increases came after many years of rate decreases that unfavorably affected the industry in the late s 
if we are unable to maintain rate increases or decrease our costs  our profit margin will be adversely affected 
see further discussion under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  reinsurance costs for workers compensation have increased 
reinsurance costs increased over the prior year continuing a pattern of cost increases beginning in these higher costs  if not recovered through increased rates from our customers  will adversely affect our profit margin 
see further discussion under premiums ceded  low interest rates reduce our investment income 
interest rates for investment grade instruments are lower than historic averages 
our investment income is directly affected by the interest rate at which we invest our free cash flow 
the historical low interest rate environment during the pase several years contributed to a significant mortgage refinancing boom  resulting in prepayment of our mortgage backed investments and increased our cash on hand in acic 
we continue to invest these funds in short term instruments 
an ongoing low interest rate environment will adversely affect our investment income 
see further discussion under investment income and net realized investment gains  and profitable service revenue growth could be difficult 
the national market for disability management services is highly competitive and includes national  regional and local providers of services 
we do not have a national presence  limiting our ability to service national accounts 
any infrastructure changes to support growth in our non insurance revenues could be expensive and diminish our earnings in the short term 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies included in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies include those policies related to our accounting for i premiums earned  ii unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims and the related reinsurance recoverables  iii deferred policy acquisition costs  iv income taxes and deferred income taxes  and v investments 
these accounting policies are discussed within each section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
service revenue includes revenues for services that are i billed as a percent of premium of insurance policies issued by non affiliated third party insurers  ii billed based on the number and type of claims serviced  iii billed on an hourly basis based on direct activity  or iv billed based on contract duration 
service revenue earned as a percent of premium is recognized over the life of the underlying insurance policy and the related claims in a manner consistent with rtw s premiums earned revenue recognition policy 
service revenue related to claims management is recognized over the expected duration of the claims management activity 
service revenue is recognized as services are performed over the life of the contract 
the excess of billed service revenue over earned amounts is recognized as a liability and included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
financial summary this financial summary presents our discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rtw  inc this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements at december  
table of contents the following table provides an overview of our key operating results s  except per share amounts year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums earned service revenue total revenues claim and claim settlement expenses net income diluted income per share we reported net income of million in compared to net income of million in and million in we reported diluted income per share of in compared to diluted income per share of in and in the primary factors affecting our operating results included the following gross premiums earned increased to million in from million in due primarily to an increase in average premiums in force to million for from million in see further discussion under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  premiums earned increased to million in from million in premiums earned in reflect the increase in gross premiums earned from  and an increase in final audit premiums earned in compared to  offset by an increase in premiums ceded as our cost of excess of loss reinsurance increased in  in addition to the factors affecting premiums earned  total revenues increased as we recorded  of net realized investment gains in compared to  recorded in  claim and claim settlement expenses increased to of premiums earned for from for favorable development for prior accident years reduced claim and claim settlement expenses by million in compared to million in claim and claim settlement expenses also increased in due to the increase in gross premiums earned in compared to see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses  and at december   we eliminated the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset 
this allowance was originally established at december  at million  and was decreased by million in  million in and million in the million and million decreases in the valuation allowance favorably affected our income tax expense in and  respectively 
see further discussion under income taxes 
we expect premiums in force to remain consistent with we also anticipate that premium rates will decrease slightly in as the markets in which we operate continue to become more competitive 
we expect to increase non insurance revenue significantly in we will focus on profitability by i increasing our non insurance revenue significantly  ii aggressively managing and closing claims  iii reviewing policy profitability at renewal and removing unprofitable accounts  and iv aggressively managing policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
in the following pages  we take a look at the  and operating results for items in our consolidated statements of income and also explain key balance sheet accounts in greater detail 

table of contents results of operations total revenues our total revenues include premiums earned  investment income  net realized investment gains and service revenue 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenues and premiums in force s year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums ceded premiums earned investment income net realized investment gains realized investment gains realized investment losses net realized investment gains service revenue total revenues premiums in force by region at year end minnesota colorado michigan closed regional offices missouri and new england total premiums in force premiums in force and gross premiums earned premiums on workers compensation insurance policies are our largest source of revenue 
premiums earned are the gross premiums earned by us on in force workers compensation policies  net of the effects of ceded premiums under reinsurance agreements 
the premium we charge a policyholder is a function of the policyholders payroll  industry and prior workers compensation claims experience 
in underwriting a policy  we receive policyholder payroll estimates for the ensuing year 
we record premiums written on an installment basis matching our billing to the policyholder and earn premiums on a daily basis over the life of each insurance policy based on the payroll estimate 
we record the excess of premiums billed over premiums earned for each policy as unearned premiums on our balance sheet 
when a policy expires  we audit policyholder payrolls for the policy period and adjust the estimated payroll to its actual value 
the result is a final audit adjustment recorded to premiums earned when the adjustment becomes known 
final audit premiums recognized during the period include billed final audit premiums plus or minus the change in estimate for premiums on unexpired and expired unaudited policies 
our premiums in force increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  premiums in force in our minnesota and michigan regions grew million and million  respectively  in the increases in the minnesota and michigan regions were offset by a million decrease in colorado 
average premiums in force increased to million in from million in but decreased from million in in order to improve profitability  we aggressively targeted policies that did not meet our underwriting profit margin standards for non renewal or re underwriting at increased rates at policy expiration in  and our average annual premium per policy increased to  in from  in and  in as a result of the re underwriting in those years 

table of contents our gross premiums earned increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from i the increase in average premiums in force  and ii final audit premiums which increased gross premiums earned by million in compared to a  increase in gross premiums earned decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from i the decrease in average premiums in force  offset by ii final audit premiums which increased gross premiums earned by  in  compared to a million decrease in in  and  we were able to increase premium rates on renewing policies an average of  and  respectively 
we have been able to increase premium rates in our markets due to the following many workers compensation insurers have withdrawn from the markets in which we write premiums as profitability diminished in the workers compensation insurance line  reinsurance rates for workers compensation insurers have increased due to i reductions in reinsurer s surplus as a result of the september  terrorist acts against the united states  ii unprofitability resulting from highly competitive reinsurance pricing in the late s  iii settlements related to certain reinsurance treaties written in the late s  iv five major reinsurers leaving the market in  and v low investment yields 
these rate increases have resulted in increased costs for workers compensation insurers 
insurers  including rtw  have raised premium rates to offset these increases in reinsurance premiums  and a number of workers compensation insurers financial ratings decreased due to reserve adjustments recorded in  and resulting in a reduced capacity and creditworthiness of those insurers 
premiums ceded reinsurance agreements enable us to share certain risks with other insurance companies 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us from potential losses in excess of the level we are willing to accept 
we expect the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance to honor their obligations 
in the event that these companies are unable to honor their obligations to us  we will be required to pay the underlying obligations ourselves 
we are not aware of any developments with respect to any of our reinsurers that would result in our current reinsurance balances becoming uncollectible 
under our excess of loss reinsurance policies  we pay reinsurers to limit our per incident exposure and record this cost to premiums ceded as a reduction of gross premiums earned 
in minnesota  we are required to purchase excess of loss coverage for our minnesota policies from the minnesota workers compensation reinsurance association wcra 
we purchased reinsurance for in our states other minnesota from four reinsurers 
the following table summarizes our reinsurance coverage all losses ceded on a per occurrence basis covers losses per occurrence in excess of limited to minnesota wcra  statutory limit various reinsurers   wcra  statutory limit various reinsurers   wcra  statutory limit other states various reinsurers  million excluding acts of terrorism various reinsurers  million excluding acts of terrorism various reinsurers  million we decreased our retention levels in and to further reduce volatility in our operating results 

table of contents premiums ceded to reinsurers increased to million in from million in the increase in premiums ceded resulted primarily from i our cost for excess of loss reinsurance coverage increased in all regions in  ii gross premiums earned in increased from  and iii the results include a  decrease in excess of loss premiums ceded resulting from a change in estimated reinsurance cost for the wcra compared to a  increase in excess of loss premiums ceded in premiums ceded to reinsurers increased to million in from million in the increase in premiums ceded resulted primarily from i our cost for excess of loss reinsurance coverage increased substantially in our non minnesota regions in while our minnesota cost decreased only slightly  ii we decreased our retention to  in all our regions in by purchasing increased excess of loss coverage in order to further reduce volatility in our operating results  and iii the results include a  increase in excess of loss premiums ceded resulting from a change in estimated reinsurance cost for the wcra compared to a million decrease in excess of loss premiums ceded in outlook the outlook for premiums in force  gross premiums earned and premiums ceded include the following factors we expect premium rates to decrease on new and renewal policies as national and regional carriers focus on writing and retaining workers compensation insurance 
we expect to add new agency relationships in and terminate some that are not performing well 
we expect premiums in force to decrease slightly in with any growth occurring primarily in our minnesota and michigan regions  our gross premiums earned will move in the same direction as our premiums in force  lagging slightly as premiums are earned over the term of the insurance policy  and premiums ceded under excess of loss policies will increase as a percent of gross premiums earned in when compared to the results attained for we maintained a  retention in all our regions in the cost of excess of loss reinsurance has increased at all retention levels and for all regions in investment income and net realized investment gains investment income includes earnings from our investment portfolio and  in interest on our deposit receivable 
our net realized investment gains  displayed separately on our accompanying consolidated statements of income  include gains and losses from sales of securities 
we currently invest entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable and tax exempt fixed maturity investments and classify our investments as available for sale 
our primary investment objective is to maintain a diversified  high quality  fixed investment portfolio structured to maximize our after tax investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
for further discussion of investments  see the investments section of this management s discussion and analysis 
at december   we were invested entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable fixed maturity investments 
we added us domiciled investment grade tax exempt fixed maturity investments in to take advantage of the tax benefits of those securities and interest rate spreads 
we also held significant cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
in order to reduce the near term interest rate risk on the portfolio  we built our cash position throughout by holding cash received on mortgage backed security prepayments and through sales of securities in september with the expectation that interest rates would rise in the near term 
we intend to hold our available for sale investments to maturity  but may sell them before maturity in response to tax planning considerations  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk and changes in funding sources or terms  or to address liquidity needs 
investment income decreased to million in from million in this decrease in investment income resulted from the decrease in our average book interest rates during and was partially offset by the increase in assets invested  to million in from in interest rates at december  were at approximately the same levels as december approximately million of mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio were repaid earlier than expected due to consumer 
table of contents mortgage refinancing and normal repayment patterns that occurred in an additional million of other securities matured during the funds that became available could not be reinvested at comparable rates  causing the book investment yield to decline from our book investment yield  excluding cash and cash equivalents  declined to at december  from at december  the investment yields realized in future periods will be affected by yields attained on new investments 
investment income decreased to million in from million in after excluding  of interest earned on our deposit receivable in  for which there was no equivalent amount earned in  investment income increased slightly to million in from million in investment income increased slightly as average invested assets increased to million in from in this increase in investment income resulting from the increase in assets invested was offset by a decrease in interest rates during interest rates declined early in the year  reaching a low point in june before returning to beginning of the year levels by december approximately million of mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio were repaid earlier than expected due to the significant consumer mortgage refinancing that occurred in an additional million of other securities matured during the funds that became available could not be reinvested at comparable rates  causing the book investment yield to decline from our book investment yield  excluding cash and cash equivalents  declined to at december  from at december  in and  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to take advantage of favorable interest rates and realized net investment gains totaling  and  respectively 
in  we sold certain securities within the portfolio and realized net investment gains totaling million as we repositioned the portfolio 
outlook we expect that income from our investment portfolio for will be affected by the following our investment in tax exempt municipal bonds will reduce investment income and favorably affect net income as investment yields will be lower on a pre tax basis but will be higher on a tax adjusted basis  we expect interest rates to increase in the timing of any such rate increases is unknown at this time 
we intend to invest our excess cash into higher yielding investments in as rates increase  we expect that short term interest rates on cash and cash equivalents will increase in as the federal reserve board increases its rates  cash flows for are expected to be adversely affected by decreases in cash flows resulting from claim payments on claims from and prior years offset by cash flows from our premiums as we increase our premiums earned in  recognition of realized investment gains and losses will depend on sales of our investments  if any  to meet our short term cash requirements or as we reposition our portfolio to further manage our portfolio returns  and new and renegotiated reinsurance treaties may affect our future cash flow and future investment income 
service revenue service revenue includes revenues for services that are i billed as a percent of premium of insurance policies issued by non affiliated third party insurers  ii billed based on the number and type of claims serviced  iii billed on an hourly basis based on direct activity  or iv billed based on contract duration 
our customers include the minnesota workers compensation assigned risk plan arp  self insured employers  other insurance companies  insurance agents and local governmental units 
service revenue grew to  in from  in and  in service revenue outlook service revenue will increase significantly in due to the following in march  we were awarded a three year contract to service of the arp 
we are paid a fee based on a percent of the premium we service and began servicing new arp business on july  and renewal arp business on september  we believe the annual premium for the arp to be 
table of contents in excess of million 
we currently expect this contract to produce service revenue in excess of million during  some of which will be deferred to future periods  and we currently have additional non insurance customers in minnesota  michigan  california and indiana that will generate approximately million of annualized service revenue over the term of their contracts 
we continue to market our alternative products aggressively inside and outside the regions in which we currently operate 
we expect service revenue will increase as new customers become aware of and purchase these services 
the ultimate effect on service revenue is unknown at this time 
total expenses our expenses include claim and claim settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes 
claim and claim settlement expenses claim expenses refer to medical and indemnity benefits that we paid or expect to pay to claimants for events that have occurred 
the costs of investigating  resolving and processing these claims are referred to as claim settlement expenses 
we record these expenses  net of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts  to claim and claim settlement expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
claim and claim settlement expenses are our largest expense and result in our largest liability 
we establish reserves that reflect our estimates of the total claim and claim settlement expenses we will ultimately have to pay under our workers compensation insurance policies 
these include claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
for further discussion of reserve determination  see the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we experienced an increase in the estimated number of ultimate claims for compared to and the number of estimated ultimate claims by accident year increased to approximately  in from  in and  in the increase in correlates directly to i the increase in gross earned premiums  and ii the re underwriting that we completed with respect to our in force policies in  and the gross and net average estimated cost per claim which includes both claim and claim settlement expenses totaled approximately  and  in compared to  and  in and  and  in  respectively 
the and decreases in gross and net average estimated cost per claim  when compared to the data  is primarily the result of our improved ability to manage cases and claims offset by increases in severity ie  the average cost of a claim 
the trend of increasing severity is attributable to a combination of factors that include increasing medical and indemnity costs reimbursements to injured workers for lost wages per claim and a decline in the number of claims being reported over the last several years 
the declining frequency of claims contributes to the increasing severity trend because the frequency decline has been concentrated in less expensive claims claims involving less time off from work and less severe injuries 
at december   the number of claims reported but unpaid open claims and the approximate average gross and net reserves on the claims occurring in the following accident years were  claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve  claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve  and claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve 
the average gross and net reserves per claim are less in than in and as the open claims include newly reported claims from the later half of  including many with much lower severity that have not had time to close  as well as new claims that are incurred but not yet reported 
the remaining open claims from and are primarily claims with significant injury characteristics resulting in the increase in outstanding average gross and net reserves per claim 
compared to claim and claim settlement expenses increased to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses increased to in from in these changes are due to the following the increase in gross premiums earned as discussed above under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  
table of contents the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include a million decrease in prior years reserves 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  and iii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited thirteen year historical claim data and our small claim population  claim and claim settlement expenses increased in total due to the overall increase in average premiums in force and increased as a percent of premiums earned as reinsurance ceded costs increased as a percent of gross premiums earned in  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 
compared to claim and claim settlement expenses decreased significantly to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to in from in these changes are due to the following the decrease in gross premiums earned as discussed above under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include an million decrease in prior years reserves 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  iii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited twelve year historical claim data and our small claim population  claim and claims settlement expenses decreased in total due to the overall decrease in average premiums in force and decreased as a percent of gross premiums earned as premium rate increases realized in and flow through premiums earned  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 
outlook we expect that claim and claim settlement expenses will be affected by the following factors claim costs will continue to be affected by i increases in medical and indemnity costs resulting from inflationary changes  ii severity experienced in current and future periods in our policyholder base  iii changes resulting from increases in operating efficiency and effectiveness realized through enhancements to our internal processes and procedures  including changes to our proprietary computer systems  and iv legislative changes that affect benefits payable under workers compensation laws  increases decreases in premium rates will have a direct affect on gross premiums earned without a corresponding affect on claim and claim settlement expenses  ultimately affecting claim and claim settlement expense as a percent of premiums earned 
legislative changes in estimated loss costs  increased competition and changes in customer loss experience may offset or eliminate the effect of any rate improvement  and continued application of our claims management technology and methods to all open claims 
the ultimate effect of the above factors on claim and claim settlement expenses as a percent of premiums earned for the remainder of is unknown at this time 

table of contents policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs are costs directly related to writing an insurance policy and include commissions  state premium taxes  underwriting personnel costs and expenses  sales and marketing costs and other underwriting expenses  less ceding commissions received from our reinsurers 
ceding commissions are amounts that reinsurers pay to us for placing reinsurance with them 
the following table summarizes policy acquisition costs s year ended december  commission expense premium tax expense other policy acquisition costs direct policy acquisition costs ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance total policy acquisition costs under certain of our excess of loss reinsurance policies  the reinsurer returns a portion of the premiums we cede as ceding commissions to reimburse us for our cost of placing and managing policies 
ceding commissions received under excess of loss reinsurance policies totaled million in compared to million in these ceding commissions reduced our policy acquisition costs 
no similar ceding commissions existed in excluding the effect of ceding commissions  policy acquisition costs were million in  million in and million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  direct policy acquisition costs were in compared to in and in the decrease in and increase in compared to reflect the following gross premiums earned increased in compared to and resulting in corresponding increases in policy acquisition costs  commission expense decreased to of gross premiums earned in from in and increased from in this decrease in commission rates is the result of new business growth that we experienced in the second half of on which we paid higher commission rates and the focus in on reducing the commissions we pay 
in  our renewal business  on which we pay lower commission rates  significantly outpaced our new business 
in all of our markets  we believe the commission rates we pay are marketplace competitive  premium tax expense paid to states was of gross premiums earned in  of gross premiums earned in and in  and other policy acquisition costs consist of various state and regulatory assessments related to second injury funds and mandatory state pools  payroll audit vendor costs  and the net effect of assigned risk plan activity in the states in which we operate 
other policy acquisition costs were affected by the following i in  we recorded a  increase in other policy acquisition costs reflecting a re allocation of mandatory reinsurance pool expenses compared to a million increase recorded in  we were not assessed any re allocation in  ii in  michigan changed the basis of its second injury fund assessment from a claims based assessment to a premium based assessment  resulting in an  benefit in compared to no benefit received in or  iii in  we received a  favorable adjustment from a state data collection agency resulting from our significant decrease in premiums  and iv a general change related to the increase or decrease in gross premiums earned 
excluding the mandatory pool re allocation  second injury fund assessment changes and refunds from data collection organizations discussed above  other policy acquisitions costs were in  in and in 
table of contents outlook we expect that policy acquisition costs in will be affected by the following our commission expense will continue to be affected by how much new business we write relative to renewal business as we pay higher commissions on new policies 
we had significant new business growth in the latter half of and the first half of  which will continue to affect commission expense in we expect new business growth in to decrease from premium tax accrual rates will return to their normal level of in other underwriting expenses will continue to be affected by pool reimbursements offset by pool disbursements  the effect of which is not known at this time 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs  office rent  certain state administrative charges based on premiums and other costs and expenses not specific to claim and claim settlement expenses or policy acquisition costs 
our general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in and in general and administrative expenses decreased in from and as follows general and administrative expenses decreased in from levels 
significant changes include i the reversal of a previously recorded contingent reinsurance commission resulting in  in expense in  ii bonus expense of million in compared to  in  iii bad debt expense was  lower in  and iv we operated with fewer average headcount in compared to  general and administrative expenses increased in from levels 
significant changes include i the reversal of a previously recorded contingent reinsurance commission resulting in  in expense in  ii  in expenses related to severance and relocation in  iii increased professional fees  and iv costs associated with investing in the necessary staff and infrastructure to position us for growth  outlook we expect that general and administrative expenses will be affected by the following general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of gross premiums earned  are expected to decrease since we will earn more premium and service revenue in and will have more premium and revenue to cover our relatively fixed costs  we will make appropriate investments in infrastructure to position us for future growth of our service revenue and to continue to support and enhance our core insurance operations  although we have no current plans to open additional offices in  if service opportunities warrant opening a new office  we will evaluate the opportunities that present themselves  and all expenses will continue to be aggressively managed and reduced where appropriate 
interest expense we incurred interest charges on our term loan in and the note payable was paid in full in september we incurred no interest charges in and expect the same in income taxes we incur federal income taxes on our combined service organization rtw operations and insurance acic operations 
we incur state income taxes on the results of our service organization s operations and incur premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes for our insurance operations 
in certain instances  we may incur state income taxes on our insurance operations 
additionally  certain provisions of the internal revenue code adversely affect our taxable income by accelerating recognition and payment of income taxes 
adjustments to book income generating current tax liabilities include limitations on the deductibility of unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses net of reinsurance recoverables  limitations on the deductibility of unearned premium reserves and limitations on deductions for bad debt reserves 

table of contents in assessing our ability to realize deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider recent operating results  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
at december   we established a million valuation allowance allowance against deferred tax assets resulting in a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
this allowance decreased by million to million at december  as a result of the income we earned in and federal tax refunds totaling million resulting from a change in federal tax law 
this allowance was further decreased by million in to million as a result of the income we earned in and our analysis of projected taxable income 
at december   we expect that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of the future income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
as a result  we eliminated the deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a million benefit to income taxes in under the first provision of the job creation and worker assistance act of  signed into law in march  we were allowed to carry back our net operating loss for five years  to  instead of two years under previous law 
we filed our tax return in september  and received a refund totaling approximately million as a result of this federal legislative change from carrying back our loss 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  includes a million benefit resulting from reducing the allowance 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  included a million benefit resulting from reducing the allowance as we offset current year earnings by losses carried forward from and  in alternative minimum tax expense 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  included the following i a million benefit from carrying back our loss five years under the tax law change  ii a million benefit resulting from reducing the allowance as we realized favorable claim reserve development in  and iii a further benefit as we offset current year earnings by losses carried forward from after adjusting for the allowance benefit recorded  income tax expense was million for compared to million for and million for as a percent of income before income taxes  the income tax expense before any benefit from reducing the allowance was of the income before income taxes in compared to in and in the decreased tax rate in is the result of the benefit of tax exempt investment income realized in and other permanent book tax differences 
further  the income tax expense percentages for  and have been affected by i our income from operations  and ii changes in taxable net income from our insurance subsidiary acic which is subject to only federal income taxes 
outlook income tax expense will vary based on i the income from operations we earn in  ii in which company we earn the income as rtw s earnings are subject to state taxes  iii the amount of tax exempt income we earn in  and iv the amount of permanent book tax differences realized 
the ultimate change is unknown at this time 
investments our portfolio of fixed maturity securities included us government securities  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities and asset backed securities at december  our portfolio is managed by an independent investment manager to maximize our after tax investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
in and  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to take advantage of favorable interest rates and realized net investment gains totaling  and  respectively 
in  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to reduce risk and realized investment gains totaling million 
we conservatively manage our fixed maturity portfolio  investing only in investment grade bbb or better rating from standard and poor s securities of us domiciled issuers 
all securities in our portfolio were rated aaa or aa at december  we do not invest in derivative securities 
operating cash flows consist of the deficit or excess of premiums collected over claim and claim settlement expenses paid  reduced by payments for reinsurance premiums as well as other operating expenses paid 
investment cash flows consist of income on existing investments and proceeds from sales and maturities 
table of contents of investments 
additionally  as we lowered our reinsurance retention levels to  in mid  we decreased our current period cash flows as a result of pre funding quarterly reinsurance premiums under that agreement 
our investment portfolio increased million to million at december  from million at december  during  interest rates declined early in the year  leading to significant mortgage refinancing by consumers  resulting in significant prepayment or early redemption of our mortgage backed securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  we expect that cash will decrease and investments will increase in and as we invest available cash into additional fixed income securities 
we record investments on our balance sheet at fair value  with the corresponding appreciation or depreciation from amortized cost recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
because value is based on the relationship between the portfolio s stated yields and prevailing market yields at any given time  interest rate fluctuations can have a swift and significant impact on the carrying value of these securities 
as a result of classifying our securities as available for sale  and thus carrying them at fair value  we expect to encounter adjustments in shareholders equity as market interest rates and other factors change 
prevailing market interest rates increased slightly since december   and when combined with the sale of select securities to realize gains  resulted in a  net unrealized gain on investments at december  compared to a million net unrealized gain at december  unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables at december   net reserves totaled million and included the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million 
the net reserve at december  totaled million and included the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaling million net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million 
accounting for workers compensation insurance operations requires us to estimate the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables  together  the net reserves at each balance sheet date 
our reserves at december  represent the estimated total unpaid cost of claim and claim settlement expenses that cover events that occurred in and prior years 
these reserves reflect our estimates of the total costs of claims that were reported  but not yet paid  and the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
for reported claims  we establish reserves on a case basis 
for ibnr claims  we calculate the difference between i projected ultimate claim and claim settlement expenses as determined using generally accepted actuarial standards  and ii case reserves and carry the difference as an ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr claims  we estimate the ultimate net reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
the amount by which estimated net reserves  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those originally reported for a period is known as development 
development is unfavorable deficient when losses ultimately settle for more than the levels at which they were reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
development is favorable redundant when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on open claims 
favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves is reflected in earnings in the year recognized 
both internal and independent external actuaries review our net reserves for adequacy on a periodic basis 
these reviews assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current events and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
when reviewing net reserves  actuaries analyze historical data and estimate the effect of various factors on estimated ultimate reserves including i trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of medical and wage inflation  ii estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  iii our and industry historical loss experience  and iv legislative enactments  legal developments and changes in social and political attitudes 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  including changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on 
table of contents a prospective basis 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the effect of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual redundancy or deficiency is affected by many factors 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the loss and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
due to our commencing operations in  we have limited historical data to estimate our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and  accordingly  we supplement our experience with external industry data  as adjusted  to reflect anticipated differences between our results and the industry 
estimating the effect that inflation will have on the ultimate cost of claims is a major risk factor in our workers compensation reserve estimates 
future earnings will be affected by reserve development associated with any changes in our inflation assumptions 
estimates for the and accident years represent the majority of the net reserves of the uncertainty because these claims have the lowest proportionate amount of paid loss as of december  our reserve estimates are most sensitive to changes in the assumption about inflation for the and accident years 
each one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate for each of these accident years would increase or decrease our net loss reserve estimates at december  by approximately  our independent actuary provides us with an annual actuarial opinion regarding the acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on generally accepted actuarial guidelines 
we record our net reserves by considering a range of estimates bounded by the high and low point of the range 
within that range  we record our best estimate 
at december   we established recorded reserves in the upper end of the actuary s range based on our historical loss reserve development 
the ultimate actual liability may be higher or lower than reserves recorded 
our reserves are primarily undiscounted  however  we discounted reserves for selected claims that have fixed and determinable future payments at rates ranging from to in and the discount rates are subject to change as market interest rates change 
we use the same rates for us generally accepted accounting principles as we do for statutory accounting practices in determining our liability 
we also reduce the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses for estimated amounts of subrogation 
we continually monitor loss development trends and data to establish adequate premium rates and to determine reasonable reserve estimates 
reserves that are based on estimates are inherently uncertain and represent a significant risk to the business 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by continually improving and refining our workers compensation claims processing practices and by continual monitoring through actuarial estimation methods 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses at december  are adequate to cover the ultimate net costs of claim and claim settlement expenses at that date 
the ultimate cost of claim and claim settlement expenses may differ materially from the established reserves  particularly when claims may not be settled for many years 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience

the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded net reserves  based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is either increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
for example  for the calendar year valued as of december   we paid million of the currently estimated million of claim and claim settlement expenses that were incurred through the end of thus  the difference  an estimated million of claim and claim settlement expenses incurred through  remained unpaid as of december  the initial reserves in excess of less than re estimated reserves rows represent the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the reserve developed a million net deficiency over the course of the succeeding years 
the net amount has been included in income and the changes have been recorded in the period identified 
the cumulative net deficiencies in and are the result of reserve development inherent in the uncertainty in establishing reserves and anticipated loss trends 
as discussed above  due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  our estimate of the liability for net reserves is difficult and volatile 
as discussed further below  the reserve redundancy in is the result of accrual reversals resulting from changes in methods of assessing second injury funds  lower frequency in claims reported from the estimate at december   and reductions in amounts expected to be incurred for our participation in mandatory state and national assigned risk pools 
in evaluating this information  it should be noted that each amount includes the total of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of redundancy to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency amounts in   and this table does not present accident or policy year development data  which certain readers may be more accustomed to analyzing 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future

the following table is derived from the net loss reserve development table and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the same ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column represent the cumulative reserve re estimate increase decrease for the indicated accident year s cumulative effect of reserve re estimates on calendar year operations re estimates for each pre accident year accident year total 
table of contents the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  and iii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited thirteen year historical claim data and our small claim population 
the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability at december   and ii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population 
the results include an million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i in march  the minnesota state legislature changed the way the commissioner assessed self insured employers and insurers for estimated liabilities and administrative expenses of the minnesota special compensation fund 
the assessment changed from being paid by the insurer on indemnity payment basis to an assessment charged on premium to the policyholder 
we decreased our recorded accrual to reflect this legislative change  ii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  iii we overestimated the liability for our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate in and reversed that excess in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our operations 
capital resources represent those funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
our primary sources of cash from operations are premiums collected  reimbursements under reinsurance contracts and investment income 
our primary cash requirements consist of payments for i claim and claim settlement expenses  ii reinsurance  iii policy acquisition costs  iv general and administrative expenses  v capital expenditures  and vi income taxes 
we generate cash from or use cash in operations based on timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
selected reinsurance retention levels also use cash as a result of pre funding premiums under the policies or provide cash upon reimbursement of claim payments 
in and  reinsurance reimbursements from our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement  which began in mid and ran off in  offset similar payments to claimants for those years 
this trend will continue in we further expect that cash and cash equivalents will decrease from levels reported at december  as we take advantage of the anticipated increase in interest rates to purchase investments 
available cash is invested in either short term cash and cash equivalents or longer term available for sale securities pending future payments for such expenses as medical and indemnity benefits and other operating expenses 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  a money market fund that invests primarily in short term us government securities and overnight repurchase agreements secured by us treasury or us government agency securities 
cash provided by operating activities was million for this is primarily a result of net income of million  an increase of million in unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  a million increase in unearned premiums  net of premiums receivable and depreciation expense of  offset by an increase in amounts due from reinsurers of million  net realized investment gains totaling  and a net reduction in our deferred tax asset of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million due to million in proceeds from sales of securities and million in maturities of investments offset by 
table of contents million in purchases of securities and  in purchases of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was  due primarily to the exercise of stock options in our need for additional capital is primarily the result of regulations that require certain ratios of regulatory or statutory capital to premiums written in our insurance subsidiary as defined by state regulatory bodies and insurance rating agencies 
raising additional permanent capital  while difficult in the current environment in which we operate  would further reduce our ratio of premium to capital and provide a more solid base for the future growth of our insurance subsidiary 
as an alternative to raising additional permanent capital  certain reinsurance contracts could be used on an interim basis that would have the effect of reducing the ratio of premiums to capital and surplus in acic to satisfy state regulatory requirements 
minnesota state insurance regulations limit distributions  including dividends  from our insurance subsidiary to us 
under minnesota insurance law regulating the payment of dividends  in any twelve month period  acic can pay a dividend to us from its earned surplus unassigned surplus not to exceed the greater of of acic s total surplus or acic s prior years net income reduced for realized capital gains net of income taxes 
at december   acic could pay a dividend to us totaling million without the approval of the minnesota department of commerce see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acic has never paid a dividend to us  and we intend to retain capital in the insurance subsidiary 
on september   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase  from time to time  up to  of rtw  inc common stock 
no shares were repurchased under this program in we repurchased  shares in for approximately  and  shares in for approximately  we repurchased these shares on the open market or through private transactions based upon market conditions and availability 
the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock option and purchase plans and other corporate purposes 
at december   investments totaling million were held as statutory deposits and pledged as collateral 
investments held as statutory deposits and pledged as collateral do not have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we believe that cash flow generated by our operations and our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to fund continuing operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist solely of operating leases for our facilities 
future minimum base rental payments required under the leases  as of december   are as follows s letter of credit on july   we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement agreement agreement for million with our primary bank to collateralize a performance bond required as part of a service contract with the minnesota workers compensation assigned risk plan 
the agreement is collateralized by the stock of american compensation insurance company acic  our wholly owned insurance company subsidiary  and contains a restrictive covenant that requires acic to maintain at least a b rating from a

interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment 
table of contents options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
we regularly evaluate interest rate risk in order to evaluate the appropriateness of our investments 
an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would reduce the fair value of our interest rate sensitive instruments by approximately million 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term fair value was determined based on commonly used models 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on factors such as duration  prepayments  put options and call options 
fair value was determined based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios 
naic risk based capital standards the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital standards to determine the capital requirements of a property and casualty insurance carrier based upon the risks inherent in its operations 
these standards require computing a risk based capital amount that is compared to a carrier s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset risk  insurance underwriting risk  credit risk  and off balance sheet risk 
these standards provide for regulatory intervention when the percent of total adjusted capital to authorized control level risk based capital is below certain levels 
based upon the risk based capital standards  our percent of total adjusted capital is in excess of authorized control level risk based capital 
regulation our insurance subsidiary is subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies in the states in which we operate  and will be subject to such regulation in any state in which we provide workers compensation products and services in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our business  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect covered employees and policyholders rather than the insurance company 
both the legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change 
at december   our insurance subsidiary was licensed to do business in twenty three states 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue requires that when the fair value of an investment security is less than its carrying value  an impairment exists for which the determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
eitf issue applies to all investment securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and to investment securities accounted for under the cost method to the extent an impairment indicator exists 
under the guidance  the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary and therefore would result in a recognized loss depends on market conditions and management s intent and ability to hold the securities with unrealized losses for a period sufficient for recovery of such losses 
in september  fasb approved fasb staff position fsp eitf issue  which delays the effective date for measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf until certain issues are resolved 
the delay of the recognition and measurement provisions is expected to be superceded concurrently with the issuance of a fsp  which will provide additional implementation guidance 
we will evaluate the effect this guidance will have on our financial statements and will adopt the guidance at the time it is issued 
we have previously implemented the disclosure requirements of eitf in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june   and requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the 
table of contents period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award ie  the requisite service period  which is usually equal to the vesting period 
in accordance with the transitional guidance given in the statement  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service period has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosure requirements 
under the transitional guidance given in sfas no 
r  we may choose one of three transition methods 
we intend to use the modified prospective transitional method upon adoption 
under the modified prospective method  there would be no compensation charge for vested awards that are outstanding on the effective date of sfas no 
r 
unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date would be charged to expense over the remaining vesting period 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will recognize approximately  of incremental compensation costs in related to unvested outstanding awards
