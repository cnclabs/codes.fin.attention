the consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with this review 
overview fsc is a bank holding company headquartered in atlanta  georgia 
fidelity commenced operations in as fidelity national bank  a full service banking operation 
with the conversion to a georgia state chartered commercial bank on may   the name was changed to fidelity bank 
with over billion in assets  the bank provides an array of personal and electronic financial services including traditional deposit  lending  mortgage  and international trade services to its commercial and retail customers 
internet banking and internet cash management services are available to individuals and businesses  respectively 
brokerage services and products are also provided through an affiliation with a registered broker dealer

fidelity currently conducts full service banking and residential mortgage lending businesses through locations in the metropolitan atlanta area 
fidelity conducts indirect automobile lending the purchase of consumer automobile installment sales contracts from automobile dealers in georgia  florida  and north carolina through its two atlanta  georgia  offices  and its jacksonville  florida  indirect lending office 
residential mortgage lending and residential construction lending are conducted through certain of its atlanta offices and from a loan production office in jacksonville  florida 
fidelity bank is an atlanta community bank 
fidelity s banking franchise spans five counties in the metropolitan atlanta market 
atlanta s economy appears to be sound and growing based on the improvement in economic trends  and management is optimistic regarding growth and profitability opportunities for strategic focus fidelity s focus for is on the continuing profitable growth of its core banking business after the significantly improved performance in  when loans and total assets grew significantly  when income almost doubled over the prior year  and when virtually every measurement of asset quality and operating results reflected improvement 
fidelity defines its core banking business as that of providing the best products  services  and delivery systems at the community banking level required by both consumers and small to medium size businesses 
various strategic initiatives completed over the past few years have positioned fidelity to focus on the core banking business while expanding product offerings  reducing product delivery risk  reducing product credit risk  and strengthening capital 
the trust and merchant processing assets and services were profitably sold  the credit card line of business was profitably sold  and fidelity withdrew from its independent full service brokerage business 
through affiliations with the acquirers of these businesses or with other providers  the array of related products and services available to fidelity s customers has expanded considerably 
the opportunity to focus on core community banking was enhanced significantly when the bank converted to a state chartered commercial bank  subject solely to the regulations of and supervision by the gdbf and the fdic 
pursuant to the approval of the gdbf  the bank agreed  among other things  to maintain a leverage capital ratio of not less than for the twenty four month period following the conversion 
the bank s leverage capital ratio as of december   was 

table of contents the conversion of the bank to a state chartered bank  the elimination of certain regulatory restrictions  the improving economy  and the exiting of certain non core businesses as discussed above positioned fidelity to focus on community banking while expanding its niche in indirect automobile lending for the bank s own portfolio and for profitable sales with servicing retained 
the strategic plan  designed to realize this focus  was implemented during the second half of and continued throughout as core loan portfolios grew  as profitable indirect automobile loan sales with servicing retained accelerated  as sba lending was expanded  and as essential management changes were implemented 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of fidelity are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
fidelity s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including estimates  assumptions  and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies  or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions  could result in material changes in fidelity s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include those related to the allowance for loan losses  loan related revenue recognition  and income taxes 
fidelity s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
accordingly  fidelity s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the audit committee of the board of directors and the board of directors 
the following is a summary of fidelity s significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations 
such provisions are based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio  including concentrations  current economic conditions  the economic outlook  past loan loss experience  adequacy of underlying collateral  and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve consideration in estimating loan losses 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  such loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
a formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  including concentrations  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for purposes of the quarterly management review  the consumer loan portfolio is separated by loan type and each loan type is treated as a homogeneous pool 
the level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge off rates for each loan type  adjusted for changes in these pools  including current information on the payment performance of each loan type 
every commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loan days past due is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines 
a projected loss allocation factor is determined for each significant loan category based on historic charge off experience  current trends  economic outlook  and other factors 
all nonperforming commercial  commercial real estate and construction loans  and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by credit administration to determine the level of loan losses required to be specifically allocated to these loans 
the amounts so determined are then added to the previously allocated allowance by category to determine the required allowance for commercial  commercial real estate  residential real estate  consumer  and construction loans 
methodologies for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses have been relatively consistent over the past several years 

table of contents loan related revenue recognition loans are reported at principal amounts outstanding net of deferred fees and costs 
interest income and ancillary fees from loans are a primary source of revenue 
interest income is recognized in a manner that results in a level yield on principal amounts outstanding 
rate related loan fee income  loan origination  and commitment fees  and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the yield over the contractual lives of the related loans  taking into consideration assumed prepayments 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when  in management s judgment  it is determined that the collectibility of interest or principal is doubtful 
for commercial  construction  and real estate loans  the accrual of interest is discontinued and the loan categorized as non accrual when  in management s opinion  due to deterioration in the financial position of the borrower  the full repayment of principal and interest is not expected  or principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
commercial  construction  and real estate secured loans may be returned to accrual status when management expects to collect all principal and interest and the loan has been brought current 
interest received on well collateralized nonaccrual loans is recognized on the cash basis 
if the commercial  construction or real estate secured loan is not well collateralized  payments are applied to reduce principal 
consumer loans are placed on nonaccrual upon becoming days past due or sooner if  in the opinion of management  the full repayment of principal and interest is not expected 
on consumer loans  any payment received on a loan on which the accrual of interest has been suspended is applied to reduce principal 
when a well collateralized loan is placed on nonaccrual  accrued interest is not reversed 
for other loans  interest accrued during the current accounting period is reversed and interest accrued in prior periods  if significant  is charged off and adjustments to principal are made if the collateral related to the loan is deficient 
income taxes fidelity files consolidated federal income tax returns  as well as returns in several states 
taxes are accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method of fas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reviewed annually to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods or whether valuation allowances are appropriate 
under fas no 
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination 
obligations the following schedule provides a summary of fidelity s financial commitments to make future payments  primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations  long term debt  and rental commitments primarily for the lease of branch facilities  the operations center  and the commercial lending  construction lending  and executive offices as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are revolving commitments as discussed below and many are expected to 
table of contents expire unused or only partially used  the total amount of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
commitment maturity or payment due by period more than years or commitments year but more but or long term year or less than less than years or borrowings less years years more dollars in thousands home equity lines construction acquisition and development commercial mortgage letters of credit lines of credit federal funds sold line total financial commitments subordinated debt long term borrowings rental commitments total commitments and long term borrowings financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund 
certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold  therefore  the outstanding balances at any one time will be less than the total commitment 
construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period 
subordinated debt was comprised of three trust preferred security issuances issued in and fidelity has no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity 
each trust preferred security provides fidelity the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception  the fixed rate issues with declining premiums based on the time outstanding or at par after designated periods for all issues 
in  fidelity adopted fin revised  which requires deconsolidation of certain subsidiaries  which includes trust preferred securities 
trust preferred securities outstanding at december   totaled million and debt related to the acquisition of common stock of the trust preferred securities totaled million  all of which was reported as subordinated debt in all long term borrowings are collateralized with investment grade securities 
leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal 
off balance sheet arrangements fidelity is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments  which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement fidelity has in particular classes of financial instruments 

table of contents fidelity s exposure to credit loss  in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
fidelity uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for recorded loans 
loan commitments and other off balance sheet exposures are evaluated by credit administration quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement 
substantially all of fidelity s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
fidelity minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
thus  fidelity will deny funding a commitment if the borrower s financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period  such that the customer no longer meets the pre established conditions of lending 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
fidelity evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by fidelity upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by fidelity to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
fidelity holds collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary 
performance results fidelity made great strides in in terms of profitability  growth  improvement in asset quality  and improved operations to include the enhancement of expense controls 
fidelity also considered as a year of opportunity to focus on its community banking roots by making certain strategic and management changes and accelerating the process of increased profitably from its core banking business 
as noted above  fidelity over the past few years effectively streamlined its businesses  reduced credit risk  strengthened capital  reduced product delivery risk  and increased its product offerings by divesting itself of its credit card line of business  its merchant processing business  its trust business  and its full service brokerage business  and now provides these products and services through various affiliations with third party providers 
through affiliations with its business acquirers and with others  fidelity offers an even wider array of products  services  and delivery systems 
fidelity has developed and implemented its strategic plan  focused on building the infrastructure  management team  staff  products  services  and delivery systems to succeed as the best community bank in the region 
since its inception  fidelity has pursued managed and profitable growth as one of its strategies  primarily through internal expansion built on providing quality financial services in selected market areas 
during  as the economy continued to improve  most core loan portfolios grew at an accelerated rate and management and staffing improvements were put in place to drive profitable growth 
at december   fidelity had increased total assets by million or to  million  compared to  million in total assets at december  during  total loans grew million or to million at december   compared to million at december  this growth was experienced in every major loan category except loans held for sale 
consumer installment loans  the largest driver of loan growth in  increased million or to million  compared to million at december  real estate construction loans increased million or to million  compared to year end commercial loans increased million or to million and real estate mortgage loans increased million or to million when compared to year end total loans held for sale decreased million or to million  due to a decrease of million or in indirect automobile loans held for sale to million 

table of contents fidelity has experienced significant growth and profitability in its indirect automobile lending program since  when fidelity modified its strategic plan for indirect lending to take advantage of its ability to produce  sell  and service quality indirect automobile loans 
this strategy reduced credit risk in fidelity s consumer portfolio while growing both interest income and noninterest income 
at december  and  these loans totaled million and million  or and of total loans  respectively 
during   and  fidelity sold approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of indirect automobile loans with servicing retained 
in addition  approximately million in indirect automobile loans were sold with servicing released in indirect automobile loan sales were somewhat lower in due to management s decision to retain more indirect automobile loans as part of the redeployment of the proceeds related to the sale of the credit card line of business in december fidelity increased its indirect automobile production capability significantly in late with the opening of a new production office in metropolitan atlanta and through the employment of several seasoned and productive indirect automobile loan buyers 
fidelity anticipates that it will continue to sell medium to large pools of indirect automobile loans on a frequent basis  through whole loan sales 
these sales are conducted to enhance noninterest income and manage the relative level of indirect automobile loans in fidelity s portfolio 
in an improved but still less than robust economy  credit risk management is critical 
net charge offs as a percentage of total loans decreased to 
in compared to 
and 
in and  respectively 
the decrease in net charge offs in was primarily due to recoveries on commercial loans exceeding charge offs on commercial loans and improved loan quality overall 
investment securities declined million or to million at december   compared to million at december   as mortgage backed securities repayments and prepayments were largely utilized to fund loan growth in accordance with management s plan to redeploy these funds into higher yielding loan products 
in october and december of  a total of approximately million in agency mortgage backed securities was purchased  million of which was to replenish significant prepayments on the existing portfolio and the remainder purchased as part of management s plan to leverage fidelity s strong capital position by increasing the investment portfolio  funded in part with million in laddered maturity long term fixed rate borrowings utilizing a portion of the securities purchased as collateral for the debt 
in december  fidelity sold its credit card line of business  including all of its credit card accounts and outstanding balances 
in accordance with the terms of the sale  fidelity provided interim servicing for a fee until the conversion to the purchaser s system on may  substantially all related activities ceased by june   and no income from these discontinued operations has been reported since that date 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the earnings from the credit card business were shown separately in the consolidated statements of income for and accordingly  all information in these consolidated financial statements for and excludes credit card activities  reflecting continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
for purposes of calculating an imputed cost of funds during  when credit card balances were outstanding  the average quarterly net assets of the credit card business were assumed to have been funded proportionately by all interest bearing liabilities of fidelity at an interest rate equal to the quarterly cost of each applied to its average quarterly balance 
expenses included all direct costs of the credit card business and certain other allocated costs estimated to be eliminated as a result of the sale 
results of operations net income fidelity s net income for the year ended december   was million or 
basic and 
fully diluted earnings per share  respectively 
net income for the year ended december   was million or 
basic and fully diluted earnings per share 

table of contents the increase in net income in compared to was attributable to a significant increase in net interest income  an increase in noninterest income  and a significant decrease in noninterest expenses 
net interest income increased significantly during compared to as the average balance of interest earning assets increased substantially  offset in part by a decline in the net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses during was comparable to that for and would have been less except for significant loan growth in  as most measures of asset quality improved significantly  including reduced net charge offs during compared to noninterest income grew in compared to due to increases in indirect lending  small business administration sba lending  and brokerage activities  offset in part by declines in mortgage banking activities and revenues from service charges on deposit accounts 
noninterest expense declined significantly in compared to due to declines in most categories including salaries and employee benefits  professional and other services  and other operating expenses 
fidelity s income from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million or 
basic and fully diluted earnings per share 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million or 
basic and fully diluted earnings per share 
the increase in earnings from continuing operations in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income  a decrease in the provision for loan losses  a decrease in merchant processing expenses  and a decrease in professional and other services expenses  offset in large part by a decrease in income from merchant processing activities and the related gain on the sale of these activities in the after tax gain from the sale of the merchant processing business was million 
excluding that gain  income from continuing operations for increased million or when compared to net income for the year ended december   was million or 
basic and diluted earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december   was million or basic and diluted earnings per share 
the decrease in net income in when compared to was due to the decrease in the after tax income in from discontinued credit card operations and the after tax gain in on the disposal of discontinued operations 
net interest income from continuing operations increased significantly during compared to as the average balance of interest earning assets increased and the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined more rapidly than did the yield on interest earning assets 
the decline in the provision for loan losses in compared to was primarily due to the overall improvement in commercial loan quality in there was no revenue from merchant processing activities in while revenue from this source was substantial in  primarily due to the sale of this business in  resulting in a pretax gain of million 
likewise  there were no expenses related to merchant processing activities in  while results reflect merchant processing expenses incurred prior to the sale of that business and the transfer of the servicing to the purchaser 
the decline in legal and other professional services during compared to was primarily due to a decline in legal expenses related to the former fidelity brokerage subsidiary and the former trust activities  coupled with the recovery of legal and other expenses from insurance claims related to those activities 
the after tax decline in operating income from the credit card line of business discontinued operations in compared to was due to the sale of that line of business in december  with revenues in provided by servicing fees pending the transfer of servicing to the purchaser s servicing systems 
the after tax gain on the sale of the credit card line of business disposal of discontinued operations of million was realized in 
table of contents net interest income margin taxable equivalent net interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the million increase in interest income for compared to was attributable to the net growth of million in average interest earning assets  offset in part by a basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets 
the growth in average interest earning assets in was driven primarily by growth in commercial  construction  and indirect automobile lending  as average loan balances grew million  and by average investment securities balances  which grew million 
the decline in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to the declines in yields on the indirect automobile  installment  and mortgage loan portfolios and the significant increase of average balances in lower yielding investment securities 
the basis point decline in yields on loans was directly attributable to strong competition for quality loans and the flat to declining interest rate environment during the first half of the minimal increase in interest expense was attributable to a million growth in average interest bearing liability balances offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
average interest earning assets increased in to  million  a increase when compared to average interest bearing liabilities increased to million  a increase 
the net interest rate margin decreased by basis points to in when compared to average total interest bearing deposits increased million or to million during compared to  while average federal funds purchased and short term borrowings decreased million or to million 
the increase in average total interest bearing deposits was due in part to an advertised program to attract transaction accounts during average subordinated debt and long term debt increased million or to million during taxable equivalent net interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the net interest income from the credit card line of business sold in december was reported as net income from discontinued operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
thus  the data in table average balances  interest and yields for does not reflect the average balances  interest income or yields related to the credit card line of business 
the interest expense for credit card net asset average balances for financial statement reporting for was assigned based on average credit card net asset balances proportionately funded by all interest bearing liabilities at an interest rate equal to the cost of each applied to its average balance for the period 
table reflects the actual average balances  interest expense  and rate on each category of interest bearing liabilities  with the aggregate average net credit card balance and aggregate assigned interest expense deducted as a single line item  cost of funds assigned to discontinued operations 
thus  approximately million in average credit card balances and an equal amount of average interest bearing liability balances have been excluded from total average interest earning assets and from total average interest bearing liabilities for table rate volume analysis was prepared on the same basis as was table

table of contents the 
million decrease in interest income for compared to was attributable to a basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets  offset in part by the net growth of million in average interest earning assets 
the decline in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to the declines in yields on the commercial  construction  installment  and open end loan portfolios and the significant increase of average balances in lower yielding investment securities as part of management s strategy to redeploy the proceeds of the sale of the credit card line of business

table of contents provision for loan losses management s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio

the provision for loan losses was million in and and million in net charge offs were million in compared to million in and million in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding was

increases in revenue from indirect automobile lending  sba lending  and brokerage activities were offset in part by declines in revenue from mortgage banking activities and in service charges on deposit accounts 

table of contents fidelity s strategic plan calls for increasing noninterest income as a percentage of total revenues net interest income plus noninterest income 
a key driver of that growth in noninterest income is through revenue enhancement initiatives 
an important source of noninterest revenue is fidelity s indirect automobile loan sales and indirect automobile loan servicing activity 
fidelity increased its indirect automobile loan production capability significantly in late with the opening of a new production office in metropolitan atlanta and through the retention of several seasoned and productive indirect automobile loan buyers 
in  indirect automobile loan production was million and increased or million when compared to production 
also  sales of indirect automobile loans in approximated million or an increase of when compared to sales of million in indirect automobile loans serviced for others totaled million at december   compared to million serviced at the end of  an increase of 
income from indirect automobile lending activities is heavily driven by current loan production and will vary with significant changes in automobile sales and manufacturers marketing packages in fidelity s markets  which are predominately georgia and florida 
during the late fall of  florida was hit with several hurricanes  and automobile manufacturers aggressively promoted sales by offering rebates and lowering loan rates through their captive finance companies 
each of these negatively impacted fidelity s fourth quarter loan production compared to prior quarters  although fourth quarter loan production exceeded that for the same period in as a result of increased indirect automobile loans sold with servicing retained and an increased balance of indirect automobile loans serviced  revenue from indirect loan activities for totaled million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
revenue from sba lending activities for totaled  compared to  for primarily due to significantly increased sba loan production and sales 
revenue from brokerage activities increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for primarily due to increased volume  in part as the result of improving stock markets 
service charges on deposit accounts declined approximately 
million or to million in compared to million in  primarily due to competitive pressures to reduce fees and charges and because of an improving economy resulting in fewer insufficient funds charges and other charges 
revenue from mortgage banking activities in totaled million compared to million in  a decline of 
million or due to a decline in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated and sold in interest rates rose in late  reducing the volume of refinancings in noninterest income for was million compared to million in  a decrease 
increases in revenue from mortgage banking activities  service charges and securities gains were more than offset by no revenue from merchant processing activities following the sale of that business during and declines in income from indirect automobile lending activities  sba lending activities  and brokerage activities 
revenue from service charges increased to million in compared to due to volume 
the significant increase in service charge revenue in compared to prior years as a result of revenue enhancement initiatives in late leveled off in as a result of customer behavior changes and competitive pressures to reduce or eliminate certain fees and charges 
there was no revenue from merchant processing activities in compared to revenue of million in  of which million was provided by the sale of the merchant processing business 
revenue from mortgage banking activities increased 
million or to million in compared to the increase was due to increased originations and sales during the second and third quarters of as a result of historically low interest rates fueling a strong refinance market 
originations and sales declined significantly following an upward movement in interest rates during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents revenue from brokerage activities declined  or to  in compared to  as the poorly performing stock market in the first half of and the transition from a full service brokerage company resulted in decreased volume  although brokerage revenue in the fourth quarter of improved as volume increased 
revenue from indirect lending activities declined 
million or to million in compared to as the slight increase in gains on sales was more than offset by the decline in servicing and ancillary fee revenue due to declining balances of serviced loans 
the decline was caused by a lower volume of sales in compared to  sales in occurring later in the year  and the accelerated loan prepayment volume experienced during during  fidelity sold approximately million of indirect automobile loan production servicing retained 
this compares to sales of million of indirect automobile loans in  approximately million of which was sold servicing retained 
sales of indirect automobile loans with servicing retained by fidelity totaling approximately million occurred in the fourth quarter of  significantly increasing the balance in total loans serviced at december   compared to earlier periods in loans serviced at december   totaled million compared to million serviced at december  noninterest expense noninterest expense during declined million or to million when compared to  due primarily to declines in salaries and employee benefits  professional and other services  and other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits declined 
million or to million in compared to due primarily to the increase in deferred costs related to the very large increase in the volume of loans produced in the number of full time equivalent employees at december   was compared to full time equivalent employees at december  net occupancy expenses declined 
million or to million in compared to as an expiring lease at the end of on excess corporate office space was not renewed  offset in part by a 
million write off of leasehold improvements on excess operations center office space as the result of renegotiating a lease agreement to eliminate that excess space as of december   which will reduce occupancy expense related to that lease in and beyond 
professional and other services expenses decreased 
million or to million in compared to primarily due to the resolution of legal and regulatory issues and decreases in consulting and contract services expenses 
other insurance expenses decreased 
million or to 
million in when compared to due to the decline in fidelity s risk profile resulting from the divestiture of certain lines of business in and the resolution of regulatory issues in other operating expenses declined 
million or to million in compared to due to declines in numerous expenses because of cost efficiency measures instituted in  a reduction in regulatory fees as a result of the conversion to a georgia charter and improved regulatory ratings  a reduction in other real estate costs  and reductions in many other expense categories as operational efficiencies were implemented  offset in part by an increase in advertising expense  an increase in bank security expense  and relatively small increases in various other expenses 
noninterest expense during decreased million or to million when compared to primarily due to the elimination of merchant processing expenses and other related merchant expenses and a reduction in professional and other services expenses  offset in part by increased salaries and employee benefits expenses  insurance expenses  and occupancy expenses 
salaries and employee expenses increased 
million or to million in compared to  primarily due to annual merit increases  increases in the cost of benefits such as health and dental insurance  and increases in commissions

table of contents financial condition fidelity manages its assets and liabilities to maximize long term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of its financial position and the quality of earnings 
to accomplish this objective  management strives to effect efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs 
the primary objectives of interest sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels 
liquidity is provided by carefully structuring the balance sheet and through unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions  the federal home loan bank the fhlb  and the federal reserve bank the frb 
fidelity s asset liability management committee alco meets regularly to  among other things  review fidelity s interest rate sensitivity positions  its funding needs and sources  and its current and projected liquidity 
market risk fidelity s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk see credit quality and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk see liquidity 
fidelity has little or no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  or foreign exchange 
interest rate risk  which encompasses price risk  is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to fidelity s assets  earnings  and capital 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to fidelity s success 
fidelity s alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates 
the primary purposes of the alco are to manage interest rate risk  to effectively invest fidelity s capital  and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
fidelity s exposure to interest rate risk compared to established tolerances is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors 
evaluating a financial institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest rate risk and the organization s quantitative levels of exposure 
when assessing the interest rate risk management process  fidelity seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems  and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires fidelity to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and  where appropriate  asset quality 
the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve  together with the fdic and other regulatory agencies  adopted a joint agency policy statement on interest rate risk  effective june  the policy statement  focusing primarily on the impact of changes in economic value or net present value equity at risk as a result of interest rate changes  provides guidance to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing interest rate risk  which provides a basis for ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of interest rate risk management at supervised institutions 
the policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have been identified in prior federal reserve guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure fidelity s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in earnings and the net present value of its cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net present value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in 
table of contents market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates equity at risk 
fidelity utilizes a statistical research firm specializing in the banking industry to provide various quarterly analyses and special analyses  as requested  related to its current and projected financial performance  including rate shock analyses 
data sources for this and other analyses include quarterly fdic call reports and the federal reserve y c  management assumptions  industry norms and financial markets data 
the standard algebraic formula for calculating present value is used 
present value is the future cash flows of a financial investment or a portfolio of financial instruments  discounted to the present 
for purposes of evaluating rate shock  rate change induced sensitivity tables are used in determining repayments  prepayments  and early withdrawals 
the schedule below reflects an analysis of fidelity s assumed market value risk and earnings risk inherent in its interest rate sensitive instruments related to immediate and sustained interest rate variances of basis points  both above and below current levels rate shock analysis 
earnings and fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
assumptions have been made as to appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows  and other variables 
changes in assumptions significantly affect the estimates and  as such  the derived earnings and fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale or comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  the fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business 
the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates 
fidelity s policy states that a negative change in net present value equity at risk as a result of an immediate and sustained basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not exceed the lesser of of total assets or of total regulatory capital 
it also states that a similar increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income or net income by more than or  respectively 
the schedule below reflects the effects on net interest income and net income over a one year period and the effects on net present value of fidelity s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items as a result of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest as of december  and in addition  it reflects the effects on net interest income and net income of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest dollars in thousands

table of contents at december   the analysis indicated that an immediate and sustained basis point increase in market rates of interest would have a negative impact of million on the net present value equity at risk of fidelity compared to the approved tolerances of the lesser of of assets or million or of total regulatory equity or million 
an immediate and sustained basis point decrease in market rates of interest would have a positive impact of million on the net present value of fidelity s financial assets and liabilities 
an immediate and sustained decrease of basis points in market rates of interest would have a negative impact of on net interest income and a negative impact of on net income compared to approved tolerances of and  respectively 
an immediate and sustained increase of basis points in market rates of interest would have a positive impact on net interest income of 
and on net income of 
thus  the rate shock analysis at december   indicated that the effects of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest would fall well within policy parameters and approved tolerances for equity at risk  net interest income  and net income 
the net interest sensitivity asset gap at ninety days and six months was and  respectively  at december   mitigated in part by a net sensitivity liability gap of at one year 
fidelity has historically been asset sensitive to six months  however  it has been liability sensitive from six months to one year  largely mitigating the potential negative impact on net interest income and net income over a full year from a sudden and sustained decrease in interest rates 
likewise  historically the potential positive impact on net interest income and net income of a sudden and sustained increase in interest rates has been reduced over a one year period as a result of fidelity s liability sensitivity in the six month to one year time frame 
the significant increase in mortgage backed securities in the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of compared to historical levels has increased the overall interest sensitivity of fidelity 
as discussed  the negative impact of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in market rates of interest on the net present value equity at risk of fidelity was well within established tolerances at december   and was comparable to that at december  it was greater than the impact historically  primarily because of the interest rate sensitivity of the larger investment portfolio 
the negative impact on net present value equity at risk in a rising rate environment increased as a result of the purchase of million in mortgage backed securities in in a leveraged transaction to utilize the strong capital position of fidelity 
however  million of the total purchased was for the held to maturity portfolio and fidelity has utilized those investment securities for pledging requirements  with no intent to liquidate them under any interest rate scenario 
also  the negative impact of an immediate and sustained basis point decrease in market rates of interest on net interest income and net income was well within established tolerances and reflected a much more neutral interest rate sensitivity to increasing or decreasing interest rates at december   than at year end the primary reason for the movement toward a relatively neutral interest rate sensitivity balance sheet was the relative shortening of liability maturities 
at december   the relative volume of maturing time deposits scheduled for the first quarter of was low  thus exacerbating the asset sensitivity during the first six months of  while at december   the volume of maturing time deposits in the first quarter of returned to historical  higher levels 
in addition  during fidelity was very successful in growing interest bearing transaction and savings account balances  thus shortening liability maturities for calculations in the rate shock analysis 
fidelity follows fdic guidelines for non maturity deposits such as interest bearing transaction and savings accounts in the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis  therefore  this analysis does not reflect the full impact of rapidly rising or falling market rates of interest on these accounts compared to the results of the rate shock analysis presented 
the results of the basis point rate shock analysis  while more reflective of management s current estimation of probable interest rate movements over the next year  are primarily presented to reflect the results of the rate shock analysis for december   when market rates of interest were at or near historical lows 
at december   the rate shock analysis indicated that an immediate and sustained basis point increase in market rates of interest would have a negative impact of million on the net present value equity at risk of fidelity compared to the approved tolerances of the lesser of of assets or 
table of contents million or of total regulatory equity or million 
an immediate and sustained basis point decrease in market rates of interest would have a positive impact of million on the net present value of fidelity s financial assets and liabilities 
an immediate and sustained decrease of basis points in market rates of interest would have a negative impact of on net interest income and a negative impact of on net income compared to approved tolerances of and  respectively 
an immediate and sustained increase of basis points in market rates of interest would have a positive impact on net interest income of and on net income of 
the rate shock analysis at december   indicated that the effects of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest would not fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income and net income 
management believed that a basis point decline in interest rates was remote  given the historically low market interest rates prevailing at december   therefore  a basis point rate shock analysis became management s primary declining interest rate sensitivity measurement 
this analysis indicated that an immediate and sustained basis point decline in interest rates would have a negative impact of and on net interest income and net income  respectively  at december  those results were well within established tolerances 
the interest sensitivity asset gap at ninety days and six months was and  respectively  at december   mitigated in part by a net sensitivity liability gap of at one year 
in october and december of  approximately million in agency mortgage backed securities was purchased  funded in part with million in laddered maturity long term fixed rate borrowings utilizing a portion of the securities purchased as collateral for the debt 
the funding with long term fixed rate debt was utilized to help mitigate the interest rate risk related to the purchases 
thus  fidelity s asset sensitivity in the short term in a falling interest rate environment was increased  as the underlying residential mortgages making up the mortgage backed securities would tend to more rapidly prepay  particularly in the unlikely event of a greater than basis point decline in the then current market rates of interest 
this asset sensitivity in the short term was exacerbated at december   as the volume of maturing time deposits in the first quarter of was significantly lower than normal 
this particular situation corrected itself by the end of the first quarter of  as time deposit maturities were scheduled to increase significantly each quarter for the remainder of rate shock analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of fidelity s interest rate sensitivity 
the gap analysis also does not reflect factors such as the magnitude versus the timing of future interest rate changes and asset prepayments 
the actual impact of interest rate changes upon fidelity s earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any static rate shock measurement 
in addition  fidelity s net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a static rate shock analysis  including competition  changes in the shape of the treasury yield curve  divergent movement among various interest rate indices  and the speed with which interest rates change 
interest rate sensitivity the major elements used to manage interest rate risk include the mix of fixed and variable rate assets and liabilities and the maturity and repricing patterns of these assets and liabilities 
it is fidelity s policy not to invest in derivatives 
fidelity performs a quarterly review of assets and liabilities that reprice and the time bands within which the repricing occurs 
balances generally are reported in the time band that corresponds to the instrument s next repricing date or contractual maturity  whichever occurs first 
however  fixed rate indirect automobile loans  mortgage backed securities  and residential mortgage loans are primarily included based on scheduled payments with a prepayment factor incorporated 
through such analyses  fidelity monitors and manages its interest sensitivity gap to minimize the negative effects of changing interest rates 
the interest rate sensitivity structure within fidelity s balance sheet at december   indicated a cumulative net interest sensitivity liability gap of when projecting out one year 
in the near term  defined as days  fidelity had a cumulative net interest sensitivity asset gap of at december  
table of contents when projecting forward six months  fidelity had a net interest sensitivity asset gap of 
this information represents a general indication of repricing characteristics over time  however  the sensitivity of certain deposit products may vary during extreme swings in the interest rate cycle see market risk 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  the interest rate sensitivity gap is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
fidelity s policy states that the cumulative gap at six months and one year should generally not exceed and  respectively 
thus  fidelity was well within established tolerances at december  any interest rate risk associated with cumulative gap positions was mitigated in part in because of the net interest sensitivity asset gap in the near term and the net interest sensitivity liability gap at one year with a reduced net interest sensitivity asset position at six months 
fidelity s interest rate shock analysis is generally considered to be a better indicator of interest rate risk 
the following table illustrates fidelity s interest rate sensitivity at december   as well as the cumulative position at december  dollars in thousands interest rate sensitivity analysis table repricing within over one days days days days days days days year total interest earning assets investment securities available for sale investment securities held to maturity loans loans held for sale federal funds sold due from banks interest earning total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposit accounts savings and now accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  long term debt short term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap at ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets at ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities at fidelity follows fdic guidelines for non maturity deposit accounts across multiple time bands 
savings and now accounts are equally distributed over months with a limit of of the total balance in the three to five year time frame except for approximately million in a special savings account with a guaranteed rate through december   at which time the rate will adjust to a market rate of interest 
this balance is reflected in the day maturity time band  as any change in the rate will be effective for all of the following three months 
demand deposits and money market 
table of contents accounts are distributed over months with a limit of of the total balance in the one to three year time frame 
liquidity market and public confidence in the financial strength of fidelity and financial institutions in general will largely determine the access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on fidelity s ability to maintain sound credit quality and the ability to maintain appropriate levels of capital resources 
liquidity is defined as the ability of fidelity to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
management measures fidelity s liquidity position by giving consideration to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investment securities eligible for sale or pledging to secure borrowings from dealers and customers pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements  loan repayments  loan sales  deposits and certain interest sensitive deposits  brokered deposits  a collateralized contingent line of credit at the frb discount window  a collateralized line of credit from the fhlb  and borrowings under unsecured overnight federal funds lines available from correspondent banks 
in addition to interest rate sensitive deposits  the bank s principal demand for liquidity is new loans and anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers 
maintaining appropriate levels of capital is an important factor in determining the availability of critical sources of liquidity 
critical providers of liquidity could terminate or suspend liquidity availability or require additional or higher quality collateral in the event of a capital issue 
at december   capital ratios significantly exceeded the federal regulatory levels required for a well capitalized institution 
the capital of the bank also significantly exceeded the levels required by the gdbf 
management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results  as reflected in net interest income  the net yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities in particular 
alco meets regularly to review fidelity s current and projected net liquidity position and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective 
levels of total liquidity  short term liquidity  and short term liquidity sources will be important in based on projected core loan growth and projected growth in indirect automobile loan production and sales  with indirect automobile loans held for sale balances and individual pools of loans sold anticipated to increase from time to time during the year 
fidelity s consolidated statements of cash flows included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements present certain information about cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
fidelity s principal cash flows primarily relate to investing and financing activities  rather than operating activities 
while the statements present the periods net cash flows from lending and deposit activities  they do not reflect certain important aspects of fidelity s liquidity described above  including i anticipated liquidity requirements under new and outstanding credit commitments to customers  ii intra period volatility of deposits  particularly fluctuations in the volume of commercial customers noninterest bearing demand deposits  and iii unused borrowings available under unsecured federal funds lines  secured or collateralized lines  repurchase agreements  brokered deposits  and other arrangements 
fidelity s principal source of operating cash flows is net interest income 
the holding company  fsc  has limited liquidity  and it relies primarily on equity  subordinated debt  and trust preferred securities  interest income  management fees  and dividends from the bank as sources of liquidity 
interest and dividends from subsidiaries ordinarily provide a source of liquidity to a bank holding company 
the bank pays interest on its subordinated debt and cash dividends on its preferred stock and common stock to fsc 
under the regulations of the gdbf  bank dividends may not exceed 
table of contents of the prior year s net earnings without approval from the gdbf 
if dividends received from the bank were reduced or eliminated  fsc s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders would be adversely affected 
net cash flows from operating activities primarily result from net income adjusted for the following noncash items the provision for loan losses  depreciation  amortization  and the lower of cost or market adjustments  if any 
net cash flows provided by operating activities in were positively impacted primarily by net income from continuing operations of million and a net decrease in loans held for sale of million  offset in part by a million increase in other assets  principally related to purchases and increases in the value of bank owned life insurance 
net cash flows used in investing activities were negatively impacted primarily by an increase in loan balances of million as a result of million in loan production volume net of repayments  offset in part by proceeds from the sale of indirect automobile and to a lesser extent sba loans of million 
the net cash flows used in investing activities were positively impacted by net cash flows from investment securities providing million 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were positively impacted by increases in demand deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  and time deposits of million and million  respectively  and an increase of million in short term debt  offset in part by a million decline in long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents declined only million as the significant net cash flows used in investing activities were largely offset by net cash flows provided by operating activities and more specifically by net cash flows provided by financing activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities in were positively impacted by net income and proceeds from sales of other real estate  offset by an increase in loans held for sale  a decrease in accrued interest payable  and a decease in other liabilities 
net cash flows used in investing activities were negatively impacted by a net increase of million in investment securities 
this increase resulted from purchases as part of management s plan to redeploy the proceeds from the sale of the credit card line of business in early and the purchase of securities in october and december of  which purchases were offset in part by sales of securities and substantial prepayments of mortgage backed securities due to repayment of the underlying residential mortgage loans because of heavy volumes of home sales and refinancings during also negatively impacting cash flows used in investing activities was an increase of million in loans net of repayments  offset in part by million in proceeds from the sale of loans 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were positively impacted by net increases in demand deposits  money market accounts  and savings accounts of million  more than offset by a decrease of million in time deposits as part of management s plan to redeploy the proceeds from the sale of the credit card line of business and manage the net interest margin by offering lower rates on time deposits  resulting in a lower cost of funds and a runoff of time deposits  primarily from customers who had no other financial relationships with the bank 
also positively impacting net cash flows provided by financing activities were increases of million and million in short term and long term debt  respectively 
the increase in long term debt was due to the obtaining of million in laddered two year through five year maturity fixed rate debt in october and december of to fund in part the purchase of investment securities as part of management s leveraging strategy to take advantage of fidelity s strong capital position and to mitigate the interest rate risk related to the purchases of fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
cash and cash equivalents declined million for the year  primarily due to net cash flows used in investing activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were positively impacted in by a decrease in loans held for sale of million 
indirect automobile loans held for sale decreased million  based on the management decision to retain a greater percentage of reduced production in order to increase the owned portfolio 
this decrease was offset in part by a million increase in residential mortgage loans originated and held for sale 
net cash flows used in investing activities were negatively impacted by increases in investment securities of million  exacerbated by a million increase in loans net of repayments less proceeds of million from loan sales 
net cash flows from investing activities were positively impacted by million in net cash provided by discontinued operations from the sale of the credit card line of business

industry and loan type diversification is reviewed quarterly 
management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in fidelity s loan portfolio and strengthen its credit risk management team and processes 
as a result of this program  the average credit scores of indirect automobile loans have increased significantly over the years  to an average beacon of at december  likewise  the sales of the merchant processing business and the credit card line of business in have substantially reduced fidelity s exposure to unsecured credit risk

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual and restructured loans  repossessions and other real estate 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful 
restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified  because of economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  to provide for a reduction in principal  change in terms  or modification of interest rates to below market levels

see discussion regarding analyses of individual troubled loans in allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses as discussed in critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions charged to operations 
such provisions are based on an evaluation by management and credit administration of the loan portfolio and commitments under current economic conditions  past loan loss experience  adequacy of underlying collateral  and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve consideration in estimating loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in loan commitments 
this analysis is separately performed for each major loan category 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  such loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequently  recoveries are added to the allowance 
the evaluation results in an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category 
for all loan categories  historical loan loss experience adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category  trends  and other factors is used to determine the level of allowance required 
additional amounts are allocated based on the evaluation of the loss potential of individual troubled loans and the anticipated effect of economic conditions on both individual loans and loan categories 
since the allocation is based on estimates and subjective judgment  it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which losses may ultimately occur 
in determining the allocated allowance  the consumer portfolios are treated as homogenous pools 
specific consumer loan types include direct and indirect automobile loans  other revolving lines of credit  residential first mortgage loans  and home equity loans 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated to the consumer loan types based on historical net charge off rates adjusted for any current or anticipated changes in these trends 
the commercial  commercial real estate  and business banking portfolios are evaluated separately 
within this group  every nonperforming loan and loans having greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed for a specific allocation 
the allowance is allocated within the commercial portfolio based on a combination of historical loss rates  adjusted for those elements discussed in the preceding paragraph  and regulatory guidelines 
in determining the appropriate level for the allowance  management ensures that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses 
this additional allowance  if any  is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance

in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin addresses whether business enterprises must consolidate the financial statements of entities known as variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is defined by fin to be a business entity which has one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  and  the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for risk of absorbing expected losses 
fidelity adopted fin and  through review and analysis  determined that fidelity was the primary beneficiary of its trust preferred securities and that they should be consolidated for financial reporting purposes as of december  fin was revised in december fin revised and the revised interpretations clarified that trust preferred securities such as those issued by fidelity had to be deconsolidated for financial reporting purposes no later than the end of the first reporting period ending after march  fidelity adopted fin revised and  consequently  the million of trust preferred securities issued by trusts established by fidelity are no longer consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
thus  the equity investments in the subsidiaries created to issue the obligations  the obligations themselves  and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on a deconsolidated basis  with the investments in the amount of million reported as investments held to maturity and dividends included as investment interest income 
the obligations  including the amount related to the equity investments  in the amount of million are reported as subordinated debt  with related interest expense reported as interest on subordinated debt 
this change had no material effect on the operations  financial condition  or regulatory capital ratios of fidelity or the bank 
financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the deconsolidation of the trust preferred issues

table of contents considerations and clarified policies regarding capital guidelines 
the rule provides for a five year transition period  with an effective date of march   but requires bhcs not meeting the standards of the rule to consult with the frb and develop a plan to comply with the standards by the effective date

excess restricted core capital elements may be included in tier capital  with trust preferred securities and certain other restricted core capital elements subject to a of tier capital limitation 
the rule defines trust preferred securities qualifying for inclusion as restricted core capital elements and fsc s trust preferred securities meet those definitional tests 
the rule requires that trust preferred securities be excluded from tier capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued and be excluded from tier capital within five years of that maturity at per year for each year during the five year period to the maturity 
fsc s first junior subordinated note matures in march fsc s only restricted core capital elements consist of its trust preferred securities issues and fsc has no recorded goodwill  therefore  the rule has no impact on fsc s capital ratios  its financial condition  or its operating results
