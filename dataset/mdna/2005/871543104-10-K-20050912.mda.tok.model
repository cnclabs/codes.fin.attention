industry background the markets served by symmetricom include wireline and cable infrastructure  oem telecommunications synchronization  broadband access and timing  test and measurement instrumentation for aerospace  defense  enterprise and power utilities 
the past several fiscal years have posed a tremendous challenge to the telecommunications industry 
carriers and service providers have struggled with rapid changes in their customer base  high customer turnover  competition  evolving business models  continuing changes in the regulatory environment and changing service demands 
carriers and service providers continue to scrutinize their capital expenditures closely and continue to focus on leveraging their investments 
in this environment  efficient use of the existing infrastructure becomes critical to the service provider s success 
the time and frequency industry may be divided into the following markets wireline infrastructure systems  cable infrastructure systems  wireless oem products  specialty manufacturing other and timing  test and measurement 
wireline infrastructure systems market the wireline infrastructure market includes local  long distance and international telecommunications service providers and carriers 
customers in this market include worldwide public network providers  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  public telephone and telegraph companies ptts  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  and other telephone companies 
demand from most of this sector has declined over the past several fiscal years as network service providers continue to decrease their capital spending 
in the united states  there is continued uncertainty regarding telecommunication de regulation policies  and we believe this uncertain environment has contributed to the reduced spending by service providers 
we believe that the need to make networks efficient  the need for greater reliability and the demand for better quality of service in the infrastructure may enhance the need for synchronization over the long term 
further  new packet technologies may require new or enhanced synchronization technologies and protocols in networks 
as these new technologies are deployed  we expect to see increasing demand for synchronization 
however  the adoption of such new technologies may occur slowly 
wireless oem products market symmetricom s wireless oem products market consists of wireless and broadband access 
wireless telecommunications networks consist of numerous cells located throughout a service area 
in a wireless network  calls are segmented  transmitted over the air  and reassembled by a receiver within the network 
in certain wireless technologies  lack of proper synchronization may result in signal degradation and dropped calls and loss of data  thereby decreasing network efficiency and capacity 
furthermore  certain engineering requirements demand a high level of synchronization to support a greater number of callers simultaneously 
currently the next generation wireless base stations supporting g is the target market for our oem technology and products 
historically our wireless business has generated lower margins than our wireline business 
as previously discussed  the cable market has an emerging synchronization requirement 
this requirement not only defines systems  but also embedded clients to receive synchronization signals 
while these interfaces have been standardized in the cable market  symmetricom markets its embedded implementations to receive and process these signals in a cable vendor s equipment 
broadband access is another part of our wireless oem products segment 
the demand for bandwidth from businesses continues to grow steadily  and broadband service providers have focused on meeting the increased demand by more efficiently utilizing their existing infrastructure 
symmetricom s gowide family of broadband access products allows carriers to offer enhanced high speed data services to their business customers through their existing dsl infrastructure 
currently  our g 
shdsl products serve a niche market primarily deployed in europe 
specialty manufacturing market our production facility in puerto rico is outfitted to provide specialty contract manufacturing to select clients 
customers in this market are mainly from the semiconductor and medical industries 
the purchase volume of our customers was consistent throughout fiscal the gross margin of these contract manufacturing arrangements is typically lower than the margin in our other business 
timing  test and measurement market time and frequency instruments are important for expanding government communications systems of wireline  wireless  satellite and computer network technologies  as well as for synchronizing critical infrastructures such as us power generation and the distribution grid 
the increase in demand for precision timing is due in part to the growth in public sector communications and computer network systems worldwide 
growth in data  voice and video transmissions on these networks is anticipated to lead to an increased demand for substantial bandwidth compared to traditional voice traffic 
we believe that these trends will lead to increased demand for precision time and frequency products  which synchronize these networks 
in addition  we believe the network centric activities within private and public businesses that are installing  growing or maintaining internet protocol networks of computer servers and clients may also drive growth in the demand for time and frequency products 
information control in the network  as well as applications support requiring synchronized time of day on a secure ip infrastructure  are driving the implementation of accurate network time appliances on the network 
we believe these trends will continue and will drive future growth in the demand for network based time and frequency products and services 
products we provide infrastructure solutions for the global communications market 
we are a leading provider of precise synchronization  timing and frequency solutions 
the following discussion includes products from each of our five reportable segments wireline products  wireless oem products  global services  specialty manufacturing other and timing  test and measurement products 
wireline products the telecommunications network consists of a series of interconnected switching equipment and other components that route information ie  voice  video  data  etc 
throughout the network 
for these networks to function efficiently  it is essential that each network be synchronized and individual nodes within the network operate within precise tolerances 
precision synchronization equipment throughout these networks provides a frequency and or time reference to enable digital switching  routing and transmission systems to operate at a common  synchronized clock rate  thereby aligning timeslots which increase bandwidth utilization while minimizing signal degradation and reducing errors throughout a network 
our core system products are built on atomic clock such as cesium and rubidium and gps technologies 
the products belong to one of four classes primary reference sources prs consists of the gps based time source family  and the cesium based time cesium 
building integrated timing supplies bits or synchronization supply units ssus consists of the versatile ssu and the carrier class timehub  both intelligent sync distribution systems 
next generation timing sources consists of timeprovider  the industry s first node clock hybrid ssu prs  and other products currently under development to address emerging needs in the wireline and cable markets 
element management systems consists of timepictra  the carrier class hp ux based system  and timescan  the pc based system 
wireless oem products the primary use of our wireless products is in wireless base stations 
base stations are the infrastructure equipment used in all cellular and personal communication services worldwide 
many of the wireless technologies used today require high precision frequency and timing information to operate their services 
our component and sub system module products deliver stable timing to wireless base stations using a combination of gps receivers for timing distribution  high precision quartz oscillators and rubidium atomic oscillators 
their use depends on the specific cellular technology such as cdma or wideband cdma and the governing standards that apply 
for example  in cdma  most manufacturers require gps for every base station with either a high performance quartz or rubidium oscillator 
in addition  enhanced e services  which include wireless location technology helping emergency services personnel locate and provide assistance to wireless callers much more quickly  and similar location based services require technology that utilizes accurate timing typically derived from gps for the location measurement unit lmu products 
these solutions are also available to other communication applications requiring high precision frequency and timing information  such as digital television transmission  high definition television  and instrumentation 
specific products we provide are rubidium atomic oscillators with various performance levels 
gps accessory components  which include receiving antennas  timing antennas  splitters  amplifiers  and lightning protectors 
sub system cards or modules used within another manufacturer s equipment such as wireless base stations or broadband wireless solutions 
these are customized for each manufacturer  using a combination of gps  quartz oscillators  rubidium atomic oscillators  input output signals and control algorithms 
some of the control algorithms are contained in our bestime technology 
another product family within wireless oem products is our broadband access products family 
incumbent carriers are moving transport of traditional data services away from legacy equipment to new infrastructure equipment in order to lower their operational costs 
alternate carriers are moving to deliver cost effective competitive services over their atm based digital subscriber line access multiplexers dslams 
our gowide   and symmetrical high speed digital subscriber line shdsl modems portfolio offers higher data rates  greater reach and enhanced spectral compatibility when compared to legacy transport technologies 
these products deliver high speeds by bundling multiple dsl links  and focus on circuit emulation applications 
in addition  our gowide network termination units provide private line and frame relay services over shdsl utilizing the carrier s atm network 
carriers choosing shdsl to deploy services delivering higher symmetrical speeds  enhanced routing and security capabilities are all potential users of gowide 
these products deliver high value features demanded by small to medium sized businesses requiring increased data bandwidth 
currently  deployment of our broadband products has been primarily in europe and acceptance of g 
shdsl has been slow in the us global services our global services organization provides lifecycle services for all symmetricom product lines 
services products fall into five main categories engineering and installation our engineering and installation services help customers implement new symmetricom product purchases 
operations and support programs our operations and support programs such as sync office audits assist customers in maintenance of their sync networks  help ensure power and alarm diversity to avoid service outages and identify system capacity 
maintenance our maintenance offerings are designed to help customers minimize staff and expenses necessary for ongoing support of their symmetricom products 
these include x technical support  traditional return to factory repair services and on site repair labor 
innovative new offerings such as our spares support contract are proving to be an attractive alternative to traditional spares and repair programs 
training  certification programs and professional development courses our training courses enable customer personnel to successfully utilize and maintain our products 
these programs are also available under license for customers who maintain their own training centers 
consulting and other professional services our consulting services assist customers in planning new sync networks and developing growth or disaster recovery plans for existing sync networks 
specialty manufacturing other products our services and products can vary according to client specifications 
we normally manufacture semiconductor equipment 
also included in this segment are any products that are not specifically allocable to another division 
timing  test and measurement products we offer a wide variety of precision time and frequency products sold primarily to the aerospace defense  government and public sector 
these products can generally be divided into the following broad categories precise time and frequency products we manufacture precision time products that allow our customers to keep accurate time within billionths of a second in a hour period 
in many ways  our precise time products are similar to clocks and stopwatches our clocks tell us the time of day and allow us to measure the time interval between when an event starts and when it stops 
the difference between conventional time measuring devices and our precise time products lies in the accuracy of the measurements 
to place the accuracy of our clocks in perspective  a clock  which accumulates a billionth of a second time error over a hour period  will require more than  years to accumulate an error of one second 
quartz based clocks are subject to numerous physical factors that affect the overall clock accuracy and stability  including temperature changes and aging 
we rely upon gps as a timing reference for continuously disciplining our oscillators  the fundamental component that determines the accuracy of our time and frequency products 

computer plug in cards we manufacture a broad line of precision timing products in the form of plug in cards for computers 
these cards provide precise timing capabilities to computers equipped with common bus components 
aside from providing accurate time measurement  these cards can provide a variety of time and frequency and other time outputs and functions  as well as time transfer for synchronization 
currently  plug in cards connected by cables provide an easy and accurate way to synchronize the clocks of two or more computers 
we also offer software development tools to speed the integration of these cards into software applications  which may save software developers significant time and money 
computer network time servers we manufacture several products for computer network time distribution 
these products provide an extremely powerful and efficient manner in which to bring entire networks of computers into precise time synchronization 
designated computers run programs in the background that periodically adjust the time of each local computer to that of the network time server 
as a result  we believe that network synchronization of thousands of computers to an accuracy of a second or less is achievable using these products 
with the pervasive growth of the internet and e commerce and increasing electronic transactions  we believe that the demand for such synchronization products will increase 
time code products we offer a wide variety of time code generation  translation and synchronization products  including timing output options for our precise clocks 
a time code is a data format for recording and processing time measurements 
time codes arose from the need to synchronize the instruments used to monitor the many aspects of a real time weapons test and to share the collected data with others monitoring the same test at different locations 
time codes provide the digital data format necessary for computers to transfer and correlate encoded time data among computers in a highly accurate manner 
time displays these one half inch to four inch light emitting diode  or led displays  often present a variety of information including the time of day  frequency information regarding system electrical current  or countdown to launch arrays 
in many cases  the display is sold as an accessory to a precision clock to display the precise time in an instrument rack or control room 
precision frequency references precision frequency references form the basis of absolute time and frequency in many systems and applications 
our products include active hydrogen masers  cesium frequency standards  rubidium frequency standards and quartz frequency standards 
our primary reference source instruments provide stand alone dependability  ease of use  and ease of installation that make them suitable for the critical time or frequency systems found in telecommunications timing  calibration and metrology laboratories  satellite tracking stations and space based master time standards 
space  defense and avionics we offer products and programs that use cesium  rubidium and quartz technologies for a wide range of uses  whether it is a defense related mobile terrestrial or airborne platform  or a satellite platform in space 
we provide ruggedized and militarized quartz and atomic clock platforms for the most demanding military satellite applications 
for applications such as fa raptor and f joint strike fighter planes  our designs are vibration isolated with low acceleration sensitivity 
for space applications such as gps  where there is a high degree of exposure to radiation  our products are protected by radiation hardened designs 
small size  low power demand  fast warm up capability  superior stability and superior spectral purity make these devices suitable for critical and tactical aerospace applications like radio navigation  satellite transmission and tracking and guidance systems

item legal proceedings in late  datum which we acquired in october received notice of potential environmental contamination from the owner of a premises in austin  texas that had previously been occupied by austron  inc  a datum subsidiary for its wireline operation austron  prior to datum s acquisition of austron in although austron had remediated the site pursuant to then existing environmental regulations in connection with vacating the site in  the applicable environmental regulations were modified after  providing the basis for the property owner s claim that the soil at the site contains the same contaminants that were the focus of austron s previous remediation efforts 
in compliance with current law  datum had established the extent of the site contamination  which extends to adjoining properties owned by third parties 
in may  we received a demand from the owner of several adjoining lots for damages  as well as seeking an indemnity for the contamination and a promise to remediate the contamination 
the adjacent property owner has not filed suit but  if a suit is filed  we will contest it vigorously 
we believe that we will continue to incur monitoring costs for the next several years in connection with the site contamination and may be subject to demands and claims from other adjoining landowners in addition to the claim for remediation discussed above  and the amount of such costs and the extent of the our exposure to such claims cannot be determined at this time 
although there can be no assurance that the costs of remediation efforts  the property owners claims or any related governmental action will not singly or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  we do not believe our ultimate aggregate liability will have such an effect 
we currently have an accrual of million for remediation costs  appraisal fees and other ongoing monitoring costs 
we are also a party to certain other claims in the normal course of our operations 
while the results of these claims cannot be predicted with any certainty  we believe that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations

critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  stock options  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
symmetricom considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for warranty  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of investments and valuation of intangible assets and goodwill to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  also the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue from sales of product and software licenses is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue from post sale customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed 
we assess collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is essential to product functionality 
we account for these transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense when orders are shipped  at which time the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the income from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be uncollected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand  and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
during fiscal  we charged million to cost of goods sold to write down excess and obsolete inventory 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations outside the united states  primarily in puerto rico 
net earnings of our puerto rico subsidiary are taxed in part under internal revenue code section  which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income tax 
section limits the amount of qualified puerto rico earnings and expires at the end of fiscal year the change in tax law may affect our future tax rate 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits is related to stock options and has a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
valuation of investments we did not carry any investments in public or private companies during fiscal and during fiscal  we concluded that the decline in value of our investment in the common stock of sarantel ltd  a privately held company was other than temporary 
we recorded million as a loss on equity investment 
on march   sarantel went public in the united kingdom and began trading on the aim market of the london stock exchange under the symbol slg 
subsequently  the company sold the stock of sarantel ltd 
and recorded a gain of million on the investment in june valuation of goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill impairment  on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in fiscal and  no impairment losses were recorded based on these evaluations 
in fiscal  we recorded million of goodwill impairment  million of which related to the discontinuance of the trusted time division 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
we review our intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in fiscal  and  no impairment losses were recorded based on these evaluations

during fiscal we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we completed the acquisition of truetime and datum during the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the acquisitions of truetime and datum during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional million of goodwill 
this goodwill was based upon the values assigned to the transactions at the time they were announced  march for truetime and may for datum  using a symmetricom stock price of and per share  respectively 
at the end of the second quarter of fiscal on december   when the symmetricom stock price was  which represented a decline of and from the symmetricom stock price as of the acquisition announcement dates for truetime and datum  respectively  management determined that goodwill was likely impaired as forecasts for anticipated revenue growth for the telecommunications industry had declined since the transactions were valued 
we compared the fair values of the reporting units to their respective carrying values and determined that the carrying values for two of the reporting units were impaired 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the present value of estimated future cash flows based on management s estimates of future revenues

technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
the million represented million from datum and million from truetime 
the projected value of these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
the nature of the efforts to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can meet its design specification including function  features and technical performance requirements 
therefore  the amount allocated to in process research and development has been charged to operations

net loss year ended june  percentage change net loss in thousands percentage of revenue as a result of the factors above  we incurred a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal key operating metrics key operating metrics for measuring our performance include sales backlog  contract revenue  headcount and deferred revenue 
these metrics  which compare fiscal with fiscal  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of june   compared to million as of june  our backlog  which is shippable within the next six months  was million as of june   compared to million as of june  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of june   we have approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of june  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
headcount our consolidated headcount as of june  was comprised of regular employees and temporary employees  compared to regular employees and temporary employees as of june  deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of deferred revenue on sales of goods with special terms  which are recognized when the special terms are satisfied  maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  and distributor return allowances  which are based on historical return averages with certain distributors 
deferred revenue for sales of goods with special terms was million as of june   compared to million as of june  deferred revenue for maintenance contracts was million as of june   compared to million as of june  deferred revenue for distributor return allowances was million as of june   compared to million as of june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million compared to million as of june  cash and cash equivalents as of june  increased million to million from million as of june  this increase was primarily the result of million in cash provided by operating activities  million in cash used for investing activities and million in cash provided by financing activities 
short term investments increased from million as of june  to million as of june  this increase resulted primarily from the issuance of convertible notes and the fact that we decided to invest more in short term investments during fiscal the million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net profit of million and non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of million  which was partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and million increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of higher sales during the fiscal compared to fiscal the million net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of plant and equipment  which was partially offset by million in maturities of short term investments and million proceeds from the sale of a building in austin 
the million net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to stock option exercises and million proceeds from a convertible note arrangement initiated in june  which was offset by million repurchase of common stock and million for repayment of long term obligation 
our total capital spending commitments outstanding as of june  were million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of june   an increase from days as of june  due to higher percentage of revenue in the last quarter of fiscal we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
on june   the company sold million of contingent convertible subordinated notes the notes  which mature on june  and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in june and december of each year beginning on december  the notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt  including our indebtedness under our senior credit facilities 
the notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  prior to the maturity date into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock in the following circumstances prior to june   if the common stock price for a least trading days in the period of consecutive days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs is more than of the conversion price of the notes in effect on that th trading day  on or after june   at all times on or after any date on which the common stock price is more than of the then current conversion price  during the five consecutive business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes for each such trading day was less than of the average of the sale price of our common stock during such five trading day period multiplied by the then current conversion rate  if we have called the particular notes for redemption and the redemption has not yet occurred  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
holders may convert any outstanding notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price per share of 
on june   the reported closing bid price of our common stock was per share 
also  on or after june   we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of redemption  payable in cash 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on june   and for a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of repurchase  payable in cash  plus  in the event of certain change of control events related to us 
we may from time to time repurchase or redeem all or a portion of the notes  if necessary  to comply with nasdaq marketplace rule i d 
we may undertake such repurchase from time to time through privately negotiated or open market transactions or other available means 
in connection with the issuance of these notes  symmetricom recorded bond fees of approximately million  which will be amortized over a period of seven years until fiscal on may   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association to obtain a revolving line of credit up to million to be used as working capital 
on june  this agreement was amended to allow the company to obtain a revolving line of credit up to million to be used as working capital 
the line of credit contains certain financial covenants and restrictions 
the new line of credit expires on november  no borrowings were outstanding as of june  on june   the massachusetts development finance agency issued a million industrial development bond on datum s behalf to finance the expansion of datum s manufacturing facility in beverly  massachusetts 
the bond matures on may  interest on the bond is payable monthly at an adjustable rate of interest 
the remarketing agent establishes the interest rate for each rate period at the lowest rate that in its judgment would permit the sale of the bonds at par value 
the bond is collateralized by the line of credit with wells fargo bank described above 
as of june   the bond balance was million 
contractual obligations in connection with the datum acquisition  we assumed datum s liability relating to the million industrial development bond that was issued by the massachusetts development finance agency on june   to finance the expansion by datum of its manufacturing facility in beverly  massachusetts 
the bond matures on may  interest on the bond is payable monthly at an adjustable rate of interest as determined by the remarketing agent for each rate period to be the lowest rate that in its judgment would permit the sale of the bonds at par 
the bond is collateralized by a million letter of credit issued under our credit facility with wells fargo bank 
as of june   the bond balance was million 
we operate in multiple locations domestically and internationally 
as such  certain facilities and equipment are leased under capital lease agreements or operating lease agreements 
due to excess capacity on several noncancelable leases as a result of the economic downturn  we subleased certain facilities and recognized lease loss liability for the remainder 
we incur purchase commitments during our normal course of business 
as of june   our principal commitments totaled million and related primarily to commitments to purchase inventory 
in connection with the datum acquisition  we assumed datum s post retirement health care benefits plan 
post retirement benefits are recognized over the employee s service period based on a discounted rate to the employee and the employee s beneficiaries after retirement 
the health care plan was curtailed as of december   and only existing retired participants and former datum employees  now employed by symmetricom and who meet the retirement eligibility requirements by december   are eligible for participation 
the health care plan is a contributory plan

 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  in january  and a revised interpretation of fin  or fin r  in december fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the adoption of fin r in the second quarter of fiscal year did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities exchange commission  or the sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition 
in march  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to provide additional guidance in determining whether investment securities have an impairment  which should be considered  other than temporary 
the adoption of issue did not have an effect on our operating results or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive methods  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is the first quarter of fiscal  which begins on july  upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements because we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of fas r 
compensation expense calculated under fas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of fas r we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
in december  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no  inventory cost  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas clarifies the accounting for inventory when there are abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling cost  and wasted material 
under existing gaap  items such as idle facility expense  excessive wasted material spoilage  double freight  and re handling cost may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges rather than recorded as adjustment to the value of the inventory 
fas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provision of this statement will be effective for inventory cost incurred after june  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or result of operations 
in december  the fasb staff issued fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the fsp to provide guidance on the application of statement to the provision within the american jobs creation act of the act that provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the fsp states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement and not as a tax rate reduction 
a special deduction is accounted for by recording the benefit of the deduction in the year in which it can be taken in the company s tax return  rather than by adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of the act s enactment which would have been done if the deduction on qualified production activities were treated as a change in enacted tax rates 
the fsp was effective upon issuance 
the adoption of the fsp did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are currently evaluating the future effects of the fsp 
in december  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
is based on the principle that nonmonetary asset exchanges should be recorded and measured at the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
this standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis  unless neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or the transactions lack commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for any nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after june  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
fasb statement of accounting standards sfas no 
establishes new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles 
pursuant to the new rules  all such changes must be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for changes and corrections made in years beginning after may adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect results we have relied and may continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenue  and our revenue could decline due to the delay of customer orders or cancellation of existing orders although a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue  no single customer accounted for or more of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended june  or fiscal however  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
the timing and level of sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the loss of one or more of our significant customers  or a significant reduction or delay in sales to any customer  may harm our business and operating results 
major customers also have significant leverage and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  upon which we do business  which could also harm our business and operating results 
we have direct or indirect sales pursuant to contracts with united states government agencies  which can be terminated at the convenience of the government  and our revenue would decline if the government terminated these contracts historically  approximately to of our net revenue was generated from sales to united states government agencies either directly or indirectly through subcontracts 
government related contracts and subcontracts are subject to standard provisions for termination at the convenience of the government 
in such event  however  we are generally entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred on the basis of work completed plus other amounts specified in each individual contract 
these contracts and subcontracts are either fixed price or cost reimbursable contracts 
fixed price contracts provide fixed compensation for specified work 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we agree to perform specified work in return for reimbursement of costs to the extent allowable under government regulations and a specified fee 
in general  while the risk of loss is greater under fixed price contracts than under cost reimbursable contracts  the potential for profit under fixed price contracts is greater than under cost reimbursable contracts 
if we are unable to develop new products  or we are delayed in production startup  our sales could decline the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  frequent new product introductions  and customers may perceive new products as deficient if there is miscommunication about product specifications 
technological advancements could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
our success will depend on our ability to respond to changing technologies and customer requirements and our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a cost effective and timely manner 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of our new products and enhancements 
we believe that the need for synchronization is moving further out from the core of the network where our products are currently used to the edge of the network 
if this occurs  the products needed to meet the synchronization at the edge of the network will probably be products sold at lower price points  with fewer features and may be sold through oem and redistributor markets 
this would mean that competition may be greater  unit volume might increase  and gross margins may be lower 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage a smooth transition from older products to new products 
delays in new product development or delays in production startup could reduce our sales 
the telecommunications market is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets  our revenue could decline competition in the telecommunications industry in general  and in the markets we serve  is intense and likely to increase substantially 
we face competition in all of our markets 
competitors in our synchronization products segment include frequency electronics  inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  emrise corp  and oscilloquartz sa 
competitors in our wireless segment include frequency electronics  inc and trimble navigation  ltd 
in the enterprise network timing and frequency market  we compete primarily with meinberg and endrun technologies 
in the cesium standards market  we compete primarily with agilent technologies  inc in the rubidium oscillators market  we compete primarily with frequency electronics  inc  srr and temex 
in addition  certain companies  such as perkin elmer  inc  that currently manufacture products for use in military applications could enter commercial markets and compete directly with us 
competitors in our timing and frequency  test and measurement segment include frequency electronics  inc  trak systems  inc 
a veritas corporation subsidiary and brandywine communications 
in addition  the telecommunications act of permits ilecs to manufacture telecommunications equipment  which may result in increased competition 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on many factors including the cost effectiveness  quality  price  service and market acceptance of our products  our response to the entry of new competitors into our markets or the introduction of new products by our competitors  the average selling prices for our products  increased industry consolidation among our customers  which may lead to decreased demand for  and downward pricing pressure on the prices of  our products  our ability to keep pace with changing technology and customer requirements  our continued improvement of existing products  the timely development or acquisition of new or enhanced products  the timing of new product introductions by our competitors or us  and changes in worldwide market and economic conditions 
many of our competitors or potential competitors are well established and have significant financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  or to deliver competitive products at lower prices 
we expect to continue to experience pricing pressures from our competitors in all of our markets 
if we are unable to compete by delivering new products or by delivering competitive products at lower prices  we could lose market share and our revenue could decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to our investors we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the resumption of recent adverse economic conditions  particularly within the telecommunications equipment industry  which may result in revenue declines  restructuring and integration related charges  goodwill impairment charges related to acquisitions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components at commercially reasonable prices  changes in our products or mix of sales to customers  although  we have been selected as a supplier in rfps from several major wireline customers  this does not guarantee any purchases  our ability to manage fluctuations in manufacturing yields of rubidium oscillators and cesium tubes  our ability to manage the level and value of our inventories in relation to sales volume  our ability to accurately anticipate the volume and timing of customer orders or customer cancellations  our ability to collect receivables from our customers  including those in the telecommunications industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  our ability to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  customer delays in qualification of new products  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products and our competitors products  our ability to manage increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  increased industry consolidation among our customers  which may lead to decreased demand for  and downward pricing pressure on the prices of  our products  our ability to manage fluctuations  especially declines  in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to manage the long sales cycle associated with our products  our ability to manage cyclical conditions in the telecommunications industry  our ability to retain key employees  which could affect our ability to sell  develop and deliver our products  reduced rates of growth of telecommunications services  the need for synchronization at the edge of the network  customers may delay upgrading their old equipment with our new products  our ability to establish in a timely fashion subsidiaries in new geographic regions  which our customers or potential customers may require to do business with us in those regions  international customers may delay purchasing products for increased voice  data and video traffic  customers in the wireless market may delay adding new base stations which require our products  customers may experience labor strikes which could result in reduced sales volume  and customers in the wireless market may switch from buying rubidium based products which is internally manufactured to quartz based products which is purchased and sold at a lower price point  which may result in lower revenue and gross margins 
a significant portion of our operating and manufacturing expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected future sales shortfall  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
our operations entail a high level of fixed costs and require an adequate volume of production and sales to achieve and maintain reasonable gross profit margins and net earnings 
if we increase the volume of product manufacturing by outside sources and decrease our internal production  we could incur higher fixed costs per unit and integration and restructuring charges 
significant decreases in demand for our products or reduction in our average selling prices  or any material delay in customer orders may negatively harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future results depend in large part on growth in the markets for our products 
the growth in each of these markets may depend on changes in general economic conditions  conditions related to the markets in which we compete  changes in regulatory conditions  legislation  export rules or conditions  interest rates and fluctuations in the business cycle for any particular market segment 
if our quarterly or annual operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
if we incur net losses in the future  we may have to record a valuation allowance against most or all of our deferred tax assets  which would significantly increase our tax expense and hurt our net earnings although we had net earnings of million for the fiscal year ended june   we had net losses for the three preceding fiscal years 
future losses may create uncertainty about the recoverability of our million net deferred tax assets 
if we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we would record an additional tax expense  which would reduce net earnings 
in addition  these uncertainties about the recoverability of our deferred tax assets would limit our ability to recognize future deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and correspondingly reduce net earnings 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  our management reviews the results of operations for that quarter and forecasts for the remainder of the fiscal year and future years to determine if it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is needed 
we purchase certain key components of our synchronization and timing and frequency equipment from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs we have limited suppliers for a number of our components  which are key components of our synchronization and timing and frequency equipment 
if single source components were to become unavailable on satisfactory terms  we would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
if for any reason we could not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  some of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver requested quantities of components 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components  we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business  result of operations and financial condition 
due to rapid changes in technology  on occasion  one or more of the components used in our products have become unavailable  resulting in unanticipated redesign and related delays in shipments 
we cannot assure you that similar delays will not occur in the future 
our products are complex and may contain errors or design flaws  which could be costly to correct our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes and techniques 
when we release new products  or new versions of existing products  they may contain undetected or unresolved errors or defects 
despite testing  errors or defects may be found in new products or upgrades after the commencement of commercial shipments 
undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past and could occur in the future 
these errors could result in delays  loss of market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  legal action by our customers  failure to attract new customers  and increased service and warranty costs 
the occurrence of any of these factors could cause our net revenue to decline 
our critical business and manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and san jose  california  as well as many our customers and suppliers are located near known hurricane zones and earthquake fault zones and the occurrence of an earthquake  hurricanes or other catastrophic disaster  could cause damage to our facilities and equipment  which could require us  as well as our customers and suppliers to cease  curtail or disrupt operations if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be weakened and our revenues may decline we believe our success will depend in a large part on our ability to protect trade secrets  obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and patent registration  contractual restrictions and internal security to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we have united states and international patents and patent applications pending that cover certain technology used by our operations 
however  while we believe that our patents have value  we rely primarily on innovation  technological expertise and marketing competence to maintain our competitive position 
while we intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents whenever possible  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued  or that new  or existing patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted will provide us with any commercial benefit 
third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims  which would be difficult to defend  costly and may result in our loss of significant rights the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
we are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
although we are currently not a party to any intellectual property litigation  from time to time we have received claims asserting that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  or that any such claims will not result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license for such intellectual property rights regardless of the merit of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
in the event any necessary licenses are not available  we may not be able to sell or distribute our products  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we acquire other companies and are unable to smoothly integrate the businesses we acquire  our operations and financial results could be harmed as part of our business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions in the past  including the acquisitions of truetime and datum  and certain assets from agilent technologies  and continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide additional product or service offerings  technologies or additional industry expertise 
acquisitions involve risks  which include the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of the acquired business  we may incur significant one time write offs  we may experience problems in combining the acquired operations  technologies or products  we may not realize the revenue and profits that we expect the acquired businesses to generate  we may not achieve the cost savings we hope to obtain from combining the acquired operations with ours  we may experience regulatory difficulties and unbudgeted expenses in attempting to complete an acquisition  we may encounter unanticipated acquisition or integration costs that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate  our management s attention may be diverted from our core business  our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers may be impaired  we may not be successful in entering new markets in which we have no or limited experience  key employees of the acquired businesses may have expertise and know how  and we may not be able to retain some of these key employees  and some of them may join or start competing businesses  and our earnings per share may be diluted if we pay for an acquisition with equity securities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any business  products  technologies or personnel from any recent or future acquisitions 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions or to achieve any anticipated benefits of an acquisition  our operations and business could be harmed 
additionally  we may experience difficulty integrating and managing the acquired business operations 
for these reasons  we cannot be certain what effect acquisitions may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we sell shares of our common stock or other equity securities in the future financings  existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution and  as a result  our stock price may go down we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock 
as a result  our existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount 
we may have potential dilution for our shares with the million convertible notes if our stock price reaches to or more per share and our shares would be substantially diluted if we would not have sufficient funding to pay off the principal of notes or we could not be successful to refinance the notes when the notes are called 
in addition  as opportunities present themselves  we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future  including the issuance of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
if we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock  our common stockholders will experience dilution 
we are subject to environmental regulations that could result in costly environmental liability our operations are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  use  labeling  discharge  disposal and human exposure to toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
while we have not experienced any significant effects on our operations from environmental regulations  changes in these regulations may require additional capital expenditures or restrict our ability to expand our operations 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in suspension or cessation of our operations or could subject us to significant liabilities 
we could also be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims  or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs  if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
although we periodically review our facilities and internal operations for compliance with applicable environmental regulations  these reviews are necessarily limited in scope and frequency and may not reveal all potential instances of noncompliance  possible injury or possible contamination 
there can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits  human error  equipment failure or other causes 
the liabilities arising from any noncompliance with environmental regulations  or liability resulting from accidental contamination or injury from toxic or hazardous chemicals could result in liability that exceeds our resources 
the risk of liabilities increases as we acquire other companies  such as datum  which use  or have used  hazardous substances at various current or former facilities 
a manufacturing facility previously operated by datum in austin  texas is undergoing remediation for known subsurface contamination at that facility and adjoining properties 
we believe that we will incur monitoring costs for years to come in connection with this subsurface contamination 
further  we have received a demand from adjoining landowner and may be subject to claims from other adjoining landowners  in addition to claims for remediation  and the amount of these costs and the extent of our exposure to these demands and claims cannot be determined at this time 
the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation 
remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur additional unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the property 
the remediation efforts  the property owner s claims and any related governmental action may expose us to material liability and could significantly harm our business 
our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of our required compliance with the adopted european union directives on waste electrical and electronic equipment and the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in january  the european union enacted directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment directive  known as the weee directive 
the weee directive requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to be financially responsible for the future disposal costs of this equipment 
some of our products fall within the scope of this directive and as such we will incur some financial responsibility for the collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of both new product sold  and product already sold prior to the weee directive s enforcement date  to customers within the european union 
at the same time  the european union also enacted directive ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  known as the rohs directive 
this directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances  including mercury  lead  cadmium  hexavalent chromium and certain flame retardants  used in the construction of component parts of electrical and electronic equipment 
we may need to change our manufacturing processes  redesign or reformulate some of our products  and change some components to eliminate these hazardous substances in our products  in order to be able to continue to offer them for sale within the european union 
individual european union member states are required to transpose the directives into national legislation 
although not all european union member states have enacted legislation to implement these two directives  we continue to review the applicability and impact of both directives on the sale of our products within the european union 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
we may incur increased manufacturing costs  and some products may be subject to production delays to comply with future legislation which implements these directives  but we cannot currently estimate the extent of such increased costs or production delays  if any 
however  to the extent that any such cost increases or delays are substantial  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are aware of similar legislation which may be enacted in other countries  such as japan and china  and possible new federal and state legislation in the united states  the cumulative impact of which could significantly increase our operating costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to other significant governmental regulations relating to health and safety  packaging  product content and labor regulations our business is subject to various other significant international  federal  state and local  health and safety  packaging  product content and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy past violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation of other agencies such as the united states federal communications commission 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our business may suffer 
our customers may be subject to governmental regulations  which  if changed  could negatively impact our business results federal and state regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission and the various state public utility commissions and public service commissions  regulate most of our domestic telecommunications customers 
similar government oversight also exists in the international market 
while we are not directly affected by this legislation  such regulation of our customers may negatively impact our business 
for instance  the sale of our products may be affected by the imposition upon certain of our customers of common carrier tariffs and the taxation of telecommunications services 
these regulations are continuously reviewed and changed by the various governmental agencies 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could negatively impact our business results 
sales of a significant portion of our products to customers outside of the united states subjects us to business  economic and political risks our export sales  which are primarily to western europe  latin america  asia and canada  accounted for of net revenue during fiscal year  compared to of net revenue during fiscal we anticipate that sales to customers located outside of the united states will continue to be a significant part of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
because significant portions of our sales are to customers outside of the united states we are subject to risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict which may disrupt general economic activity and result in revenue shortfalls  export restrictions  longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tariffs  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  dependence on local vendors  and reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights and political and economic instability 
to date  very few of our international revenue and cost obligations have been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive  and thus  less competitive in foreign markets 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  including the euro  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in these foreign currencies 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities or derivative arrangements  but may do so in the future to the extent that such obligations become more significant 
if we have significant inventories that become obsolete or cannot be sold at acceptable prices  our results may be negatively impacted although we believe that we currently have made adequate adjustments for inventory that has declined in value  become obsolete  or is in excess of anticipated demand  there can be no assurance that such adjustments will be adequate 
if significant inventories of our products become obsolete  or are otherwise not able to be sold at favorable prices  our results of operations could be materially affected 
we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future quarters as of june   we had recorded goodwill with a net book value of million related to acquisitions of datum  truetime and certain assets of hewlett packard company s communication synchronization business 
we test for impairment at least annually and whenever evidence of impairment exists 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june  and june  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for goodwill 
in connection with the discontinuance of the trusted time division in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional million impairment of goodwill 
if our future financial performance or other events indicate that the value of our recorded goodwill is impaired  we may record additional impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
increases in our effective tax rate may negatively impact our net earnings our effective tax rate is affected by the percentage of qualified puerto rican earnings compared to our total earnings 
most of our puerto rican earnings are taxed under section of the united states internal revenue code  which exempts qualified puerto rican earnings from federal taxes 
the section exemption is subject to a variety of limitations before it expires at the end of fiscal historically  we have reduced our effective tax rate using the section exemption 
our effective tax rate may increase in fiscal as forecasted qualified puerto rican earnings are expected to exceed the applicable section limitations 
additionally  the effective tax rate may fluctuate quarterly  depending on the percentage of quarterly puerto rican earnings to total earnings and changes to forecasts of full year puerto rican earnings and total earnings 
an increase in our effective tax rate will increase our federal income taxes  negatively impact our net earnings and may affect cash flow 
we may be subject to additional taxes from tax reviews by foreign authorities although we believe that we have made adequate reserves for foreign tax provisions  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate until the foreign authorities have reviewed the foreign tax filings 
our sales and our cost may be affected by the ongoing movement towards environmentally friendly manufacturing green manufacturing various countries in the international marketplace are moving towards more environmentally friendly manufacturing requirements  and some companies or countries may require us to meet new standards  which could affect the sales of our products 
these standards could possibly be based on the production methods of our manufacturing process  and materials used in this process 
if we have to change our methods or processes to comply  our manufacturing costs may increase 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with the attestation of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each year beginning june   and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports beginning with this report 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
although our management has determined  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june   we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
if our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
these investments in corporate debt securities have maturity dates of greater than three months 
our corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than nine months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
in addition  we believe that we currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
on june   we had convertible subordinate notes with a fixed rate of  which would have no interest rate risk impact to our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business with various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
based on the intercompany balances of million with the united kingdom and million with germany at june   a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such intercompany balances  or of other accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
