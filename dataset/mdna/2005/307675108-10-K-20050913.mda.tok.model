item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report and with the risk factors described in item critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  including lifo reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  liabilities related to retirement benefits  liabilities resulting from self insurance of our workers compensation liabilities  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from these estimates  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
investments our investments consist of investment grade marketable debt instruments issued by the us government and major us and foreign corporations  equity securities  primarily preferred stock  and various derivative instruments  primarily exchange traded treasury futures and options  green coffee forward contracts and commodity purchase agreements 
all derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based upon broker quotes where possible 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their obligations 
our ability to maintain a relatively small reserve is directly related to our ability to collect from our customers when our salespeople regularly interact with our customers in person 
this method of operation has provided us with a historically low bad debt experience 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and the costs of coffee and allied products are determined on the last in  first out lifo basis 
costs of coffee brewing equipment manufactured are accounted for on the first in  first out fifo basis 
we regularly evaluate these inventories to determine whether market conditions are correctly reflected in the recorded carrying value 
self insurance retention we are self insured for california workers compensation insurance and use historical analysis to determine and record the estimates of expected future expenses resulting from workers compensation claims 
additionally  we accrue for estimated losses not covered by insurance for liability  auto  medical and fire up to the deductible amounts 
retirement plans we have two defined benefit plans that provide retirement benefits for the majority of our employees the balance of our employees are covered by union defined benefit plans 
we obtain actuarial valuations for both plans and at present we discount the pension obligations using a discount rate and we estimate an return on plan assets 
the performance of the stock market and other investments as well as the overall health of the economy can have a material effect on pension investment returns and these assumptions 
a change in these assumptions could affect our operating results 
our retiree medical plan is not funded and shares the same discount rate as the defined benefit plans 
we project an initial medical trend rate of ultimately reducing to in years 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
we presently have a valuation allowance for the portion of our deferred tax assets that we estimate is more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
determining the valuation allowance requires significant management judgments and assumptions  and each quarter we reevaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance and our assumptions related to the specific tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have been able to maintain a strong working capital position  and believe that our short and long term cash requirements will be provided by internal sources 
we do not expect to rely on banks or other third parties for our working capital needs 
during fiscal  the company purchased  shares pre split of its common stock held by the crowe family and related trusts for approximately million  or approximately per share pre split 
concurrently with this purchase  the company offered its employee stock ownership plan esop the opportunity to acquire  shares pre split at the same price 
this portion of the transaction was completed on january  when the company issued said shares to the esop 
the transaction can be summarized as follows cost of shares purchased  cost of shares retired  cost of shares transferred to esop  additional information on this matter can be found in note to the accompanying financial statements 
our working capital is composed of the following in thousands june  current assets    current liabilities    working capital    capital expenditures    at june  we had no major commitments for new capital expenditures 
the following ongoing projects are expected to be completed in fiscal construction of warehouses in both bakersfield and chico  california is expected to finish this fall 
the combined total cost of improvements for the two warehouses is expected to be approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we closed escrow on the purchase of a warehouse in oakland  california  to meet the needs of our growing northern california service area 
the total cost for this facility  after improvements  is not expected to exceed million 
we are entering the final year of a multi year upgrading of our management information system 
at june   we have expended approximately million since the beginning of the project for hardware  software  infrastructure  training  consulting and ongoing support 
our financial systems general ledger  accounts receivable  accounts payable  fixed assets and payroll were converted on july  on september   we converted our manufacturing system 
the final conversion is our sales system which is scheduled to occur during fiscal costs to complete this project are estimated to be approximately million in fiscal results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal  primarily because of higher sales prices of roast coffee 
during fiscal we initiated additional programs intended to improve sales 
we revised our sales incentive program to more clearly focus our sales people 
in an effort to advance our image more clearly and aggressively with current and potential customers  we redesigned our merchandising and point of sale materials used by our customers  and we have set an aggressive trade show schedule with a new booth 
most importantly  we have assembled a team of sales professionals drawn from the ranks of our route sales organization 
this group will work with and separately from our existing sales organization to solicit new large customer accounts and maintain existing relationships with our large customers 
in addition  we have developed some new products that we believe will appeal to both new and existing customers  including cultural drinks like horchata a sweet rice drink with almond and cinnamon  fruit smoothies an iced beverage  an expanded line of teas  liquid coffee  and some new seasonal products like pumpkin pie cappuccino 
cost of goods sold in fiscal increased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal the average cost of green coffee in fiscal exceeded that of fiscal by 
a volatile  sustained increase in green coffee prices in the second and third quarters of fiscal resulted in a decrease in profit margins on roast coffee during those periods 
as previously reported in our filings with the sec  we expect to pass on this cost increase through higher roast coffee prices  but such price increases lag increases in green coffee costs  and price increases did not take effect until june selling and general administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributed to costs associated with the employee medical program  the cost of the esop  the project related costs of our multi year information systems project and consulting costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox as summarized in the following table 
principal increases in selling and general and administrative expenses in thousands june  employee medical costs   esop   it project expenses   it project depreciation   sox compliance  total   as a result of lower profit margins and higher operating expenses  the company had an operating loss in fiscal of  as compared to operating income of  in fiscal another result of the dramatic increase in green coffee costs during fiscal was a realized loss on green coffee futures and options used by the company to hedge against a decline in commodity prices 
total other expense was  in fiscal as compared to total other income of  in fiscal other  net expense was  for fiscal as compared to other  net income of  for fiscal higher green coffee prices during fiscal resulted in a decrease in the value of green coffee futures and options used by the company to hedge against a decline in commodity prices 
other  net expense income during fiscal included realized coffee trading gains of  offset by realized coffee trading losses of 
rising interest rates have helped interest income in fiscal  but the january purchase of million of company stock from the crowe family reduced the amount available for investment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in addition  other  net income in fiscal included  of non recurring income 
as a result of the forgoing factors the net loss for fiscal was  as compared to net income  for fiscal net loss per common share was in fiscal as compared to net income per common share of in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and net sales in fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal this includes a decrease in coffee brewing equipment sales during fiscal of million 
the national restaurant association forecasted that industry sales would increase for calendar  but despite the persistent efforts of our sales force we did not keep pace with this forecast 
we note that regional results often do not reflect national averages and our california operations  representing our largest marketing area  showed limited improvement in fiscal consumer sentiment and spending patterns  which we believe affects our customers  were not enhanced in fiscal by rising commodity prices leading to higher grocery store and menu prices  record high gasoline prices which can have an emotional effect on discretionary spending  and uncertainty about job stability  terrorism and the iraq war which can lead to just staying home 
cost of goods sold in fiscal increased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal the average cost of green coffee throughout fiscal exceeded that of fiscal by 
through price adjustments we were  on average  able to maintain margins for fiscal  although shrinking gross profit margins were experienced during the last half of the fiscal year 
selling and general administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal as a result of these factors  operating income in decreased to  from  in fiscal other income decreased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal low interest rates limited investment returns  and the expenditure of more than million to purchase stock from the crowe family reduced the amount available for investment

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market value risk arising from changes in interest rates on our securities portfolio 
our portfolio of investment grade money market instruments can include at any given time discount commercial paper  medium term notes  federal agency issues and treasury securities 
as of june   over of these funds were invested in us treasury securities and approximately of these issues have maturities shorter than days 
this portfolio s interest rate risk is not hedged and its average maturity is approximately days 
a basis point move in the general level of interest rates would result in a change in the market value of the portfolio of approximately  our portfolio of preferred securities includes investments in derivatives that provide a natural economic hedge of interest rate risk 
we review the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enter into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b hold put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  we attempt to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates 
we do not transact in futures contracts or put options for speculative purposes 
the following table demonstrates the impact of varying interest rate changes based on the preferred stock holdings  futures and options positions  and market yield and price relationships at june  this table is predicated on an instantaneous change in the general level of interest rates and assumes predictable relationships between the prices of preferred securities holdings  the yields on us treasury securities and related futures and options 
the number and type of futures and options contracts entered into depends on  among other items  the specific maturity and issuer redemption provisions for each preferred stock held  the slope of the treasury yield curve  the expected volatility of us treasury yields  and the costs of using futures and or options 
interest rate changes in thousands market value at june  change in market preferred futures and total value of total securities options portfolio portfolio basis points    basis points    unchanged    basis points     basis points     commodity price changes we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee 
we price our inventory on the lifo basis 
in the normal course of business we hold a large green coffee inventory and enter into forward commodity purchase agreements with suppliers 
we are subject to price risk resulting from the volatility of green coffee prices 
volatile price increases cannot  because of competition and market conditions  always bepassed on to our customers 
from time to time the company will hold a mix of futures contracts and options to help hedge against volatile green coffee price decreases 
gains and losses on these derivative instruments are realized immediately in other  net expense income 
on june  we had no open hedge derivative contracts  and our entire exposure to commodity risk was in the potential change of our inventory value resulting from changes in the market price of green coffee
