table of contents significant accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described on pages and  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include an assessment of the realization of future tax benefits  inventory reserves and the allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations  as well as net operating losses  tax credit and other carryforwards 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this evaluation during  the company considered all available positive and negative evidence  including past results in the us and germany  the existence of losses in germany since the acquisition of the cfc oeser business until  and the company s forecast of future taxable income 
the forecast of future taxable income in germany exceeds the company s historical performance and reflects the company s best assumptions about the likely impact of several major events and other items that are expected to improve the german operation s future profitability  including the movement of additional production of printed woodgrain products from us operations to german operations 
continued realization of anticipated cost savings for actions taken which include employee terminations  reductions in material procurement prices  and the closing of the uk finishing and warehouse operations 
additional sales volume from new customers as a result of a printed woodgrain competitor which exited the us market and incremental value added gross margin attributable to sales orders transferred from the us to germany 
the foreign net operating loss carry forwards nols totaling million euros at december  relate to taxable losses in germany and may be carried forward to offset future taxable income in germany 
at present  the unused nols have no expiration dates 
in december  new german tax regulations with regards to nols were approved and became effective january  the new regulations limit the annual utilization of the nol carryforward to one million euros of taxable income and of the amount of taxable income in excess of one million euros 
during the third quarter of  the company developed a business strategy to shift production of certain printed woodgrain products sold in europe to its german operations 
this had the benefit of creating capacity domestically to serve the anticipated increase in printed woodgrain patterns caused by the major competitor announcing its exiting of the united states market 
while germany did not meet its projection for  they did generate a small taxable profit during the year 
the company has purchased an embosser to facilitate the transfer of additional manufacturing in germany during which is currently being produced in the us 
table of contents in determining the amount of future taxable income  a number of additional assumptions were made  including the amount of us and german pre tax operating income 
while these assumptions require significant judgment  they are consistent with the plans and estimates the company is using to manage the underlying business 
the company believes that it is more likely than not to recover its deferred tax asset of million including million related to the german nol carryforward at december  however  recovery is dependent on the achievement of forecasted future taxable income 
the company will review its forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve its business plan targets  particularly in germany  may change its assessment regarding the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset and would result in the need to record a valuation allowance which would result in additional income tax expense  a reduction in stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on the company s earnings 
further  changes to the german tax laws could also affect the level of the company s deferred tax assets 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo basis 
inventory cost includes cost of raw material  labor and overhead 
provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory requires the company to make judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
the company does record its reserves primarily based upon aging of its inventory and also considers activity of recent sales 
a increase in the aging of the inventory would result in an increase to the excess and obsolete reserve of approximately  intangible assets 
intangible assets include the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill and holographic base coat and worldwide holographic rights 
the holographic intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of to years and assume no residual value 
beginning january   the company no longer amortizes goodwill see footnote to the financial statements  but reviews it for impairment on an annual basis 
the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  prepared as of december of each year to assess whether or not goodwill is impaired  unless events occur that require such a review 
the reporting unit goodwill relates to has historically been very profitable 
revenue recognition 
under the terms of its sales agreements with customers  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  generally upon product shipment based upon shipping terms  price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
for certain transactions  which are not material  revenue is recognized upon completion of manufacturing  or upon use by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded based upon the company s best estimate of probable credit losses included in accounts receivable 
the allowance is determined after considering historical write off experience and performing a specific review of all individual past due accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable that the receivables will not be collected

these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  the company has recorded these derivative instruments and the associated assets or liabilities at their fair values with the related gains or losses recorded as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations

seasonality and impact of inflation historically  the company has experienced lower net sales levels during the fourth quarter and increased net sales levels during the following first quarter 
this has been primarily due to year end depletion of inventory levels by the company s customers and due to the holidays at the end of the year  as the company s customers have an increased number of holiday plant closings 
in addition  fourth quarter pharmaceutical product sales generally are lower as a result of the postponement of elective surgeries during holiday periods 
in previous years  sales of fourth quarter printed products for use in the ready to assemble furniture market have been generally greater than third quarter sales in each of the previous years 
also  gift card business sales were much stronger in the third and fourth quarter of during and  the gift card business did not have the same impact and the company does not expect the same proportional impact going forward due to the growth in holography and printed products 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or income to date

the risks included here are not exhaustive 
the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the company to predict all such risk factors  nor can the company assess the impacts of all such risk factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the company has no obligation to revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after march  or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated events 
investors should also be aware that while the company does  from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against the company s policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  investors should not assume that the company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
thus  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not the company s responsibility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments held by the company for which it is practicable to estimate that value 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments 
the estimated fair value of accounts receivable approximated its carrying value at december  and based upon analysis of their collectability and net realizable value 
the estimated fair value of the company s long term debt approximated its carrying value at december  and december   based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instrument 
the company minimizes its exposure to the impact of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in situations for certain sales for products sold in europe but manufactured in the us through the movement of production of those products to europe 
there are no other activities of the company where management believes exchange rates have a material impact with respect to the underlying transactions 
beginning in january  the company renewed its main loan agreements 
the company s us term loans were renewed at a floating prime rate of interest 
on april   the company executed two interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates on the company s us term loans

the notional amounts were  with a fixed rate of  and  with a fixed rate of on april  the swap agreements terminate on january  these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  the company has recorded these derivative instruments and the associated assets or liabilities at their fair values with the related gains or losses recorded as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to address currency or commodity pricing risks 
interest expense the company s exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the composition of its debt instruments which consist of fixed and variable rate instruments

the company has a manufacturing facility located in a member country germany  and the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions among the member countries  which for the company primarily consists of payments to suppliers 
in addition  because the company uses foreign denominated debt to meet its financial requirements and to reduce its foreign currency risks  certain of these financial instruments are denominated in euro to finance european activities 
the company addressed all issues involved with converting to the new currency  and the conversion did not have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   the company had total assets of million and net assets of million invested in europe 
included in such amounts are million of receivables owed to the us denominated in us dollars and capital of million 
a change in the euro conversion rate would impact net income by
