the majority of these costs are expensed as incurred  including costs related to the development of internal use software in the preliminary project  the post implementation and operation stages 
development costs we incur during the software application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the developed software 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales  marketing  administrative and management personnel  as well as outside legal  accounting and consulting services 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain constant or increase to support expansion of the international services division  as well as from the additional costs of being a publicly traded company  including the legal  audit  insurance and board of directors compensation costs needed to establish and maintain compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of in march  we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock issuing  common shares at per share  which generated proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately million

the total amount paid to sprint for these transitional services was approximately million during the period from may  through december  our consolidated statements of operations include the results of the tranxact operations from may  on december   we completed the acquisition of a interest in openet srl  an italian provider of pos services  for a purchase price of million  plus transaction costs of million

we accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method with the total consideration allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including identified intangibles of million 
our consolidated statements of operations include the operating results of icg telecom group  inc from november  international operations although we generate revenues in each of the countries included in our international services division  as of december  we have yet to generate positive operating cash flows in four of these countries 
when establishing operations in a country  we typically incur personnel and capital expenditures for an average of two to three years prior to establishing a customer base  recording revenues and generating positive operating cash flows 
on a consolidated basis as of december   our international services division generated positive operating cash flows 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the selected statements of operations data in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  statements of operations data revenues    cost of network services    engineering and development    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  amortization of intangible assets    costs of terminated initial public offering  total operating expenses    income from operations before taxes  and equity in net loss of affiliates    interest expense    interest and other income  net   income tax provision  equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates  net loss income    year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we generate revenues through four operating divisions 
pos division 
revenues from the pos division decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in pos revenues resulted from a decline in transaction volumes primarily from our largest customer and to a lesser extent a decrease in revenue per transaction as a result of negotiated price reductions upon renewal of certain contracts 
pos transaction volumes decreased to billion transactions for the year ended december   from billion transactions for the year ended december  in we negotiated contract renewals with some of our pos customers  and in several instances we agreed to pricing discounts in exchange for maintaining or increasing their minimum transaction or revenue commitments 
as a result  it is likely our revenue per transaction will decrease and  depending upon the number of transactions we transport  our pos revenues may continue to decrease 
in addition  we recently amended our contract with our largest customer to extend the term of the agreement for two years 
the amended contract does not contain any minimum transaction or revenue commitments 
based on the amended contract  we believe that revenues and related transaction volumes from this customer may decline in and thereafter 
international services division 
revenues from the international services division increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to additional revenues generated from our pos customers in the uk  australia  france  spain and italy and to a lesser extent we benefited from favorable foreign exchange 
revenues from our uk subsidiary increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  telecommunication services division 
revenues from the telecommunication services division increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the growth in revenues was primarily due to increased usage of our call signaling services 
financial services division 
revenues from the financial services division increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was due to the growth in the number of customer connections to and through our networks 
cost of network services 
cost of network services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cost of network services were of revenues for the year ended december   compared to of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in cost of network services resulted primarily from higher usage charges from our tsd  fsd and isd services  offset primarily by a decrease in usage based vendor telecommunications charges in our pos division  and to a lesser extent  lower usage charges from decreased pos transactions 
gross profit represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues resulted primarily from increased contribution of our financial services division and international services division  and to a lesser extent the decrease in usage based vendor telecommunications charges 
future cost of network services depends on a number of factors including total transaction and query volume  the relative growth and contribution to total transaction volume of each of our customers  the success of our new service offerings  the timing and extent of our network expansion and the timing and extent of any network cost reductions 
in addition  any significant loss or significant reduction in transaction volumes could lead to a decline in gross margin since significant portions of our network costs are fixed costs 
engineering and development expense 
engineering and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  engineering and development expense represented of revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues for the year ended december  engineering and development expense increased primarily from an increase in engineering expenses required to support our international expansion

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment represented of revenues for the year ended december   compared to of revenues for the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  and relates solely to the intangible assets resulting from acquisitions 
the increase was attributable to million of accelerated amortization on a portion of our customer relationship intangible assets in connection with the loss of certain customers in for purposes of measuring and recognizing impairment of long lived assets including intangibles  we assess whether separate cash flows can be attributed to the individual asset 
for our customer relationship intangible assets  we recognize and measure impairment upon the termination or loss of a customer that results in a loss of revenue 
based upon the outcome of our contract negotiations with our largest customer  we believe that revenues and related transaction volumes from this customer will continue to decline in and may decline further thereafter 
the intangible asset value attributable to this customer relationship is approximately million as of december  we will continue to assess the recoverability of this customer relationship asset based upon anticipated future cash flows 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a portion of our term debt with the net proceeds from our initial public offering in march and our follow on offering in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by the write off on march  of million of deferred financing costs in connection with the termination of our previous senior secured credit facility 
interest and other income  net

pos transaction volumes increased to billion transactions for the year ended december   from billion transactions for the year ended december  international services division

financial services division

cost of network services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cost of network services represented of revenues for the year ended december   compared to of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in cost of network services resulted primarily from higher usage charges from increased transactions and other services  including transactions associated with the tranxact acquisition 
gross profit represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues is largely attributable to decreased pos revenues  partially offset by decreased usage based vendor telecommunication charges

interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million related to an increase in the gain on foreign currency translation due to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared with foreign currencies  predominately the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
also included in interest and other income for the year ended december  was a gain of million on the sale of our equity method investment in a related entity 
income tax provision 
for the year ended december   our income tax provision was million compared to  for the year ended december  seasonality credit card and debit card transactions account for a major percentage of the transaction volume processed by our customers 
the volume of these transactions on our networks generally is greater in the third and fourth quarter vacation and holiday seasons than during the rest of the year 
consequently  revenues and earnings from credit card and debit card transactions in the first quarter generally are lower than revenues and earnings from credit card and debit card transactions in the third and fourth quarters of the immediately preceding year 
we expect that our operating results in the foreseeable future will be significantly affected by seasonal trends in the credit card and debit card transaction market 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance the costs of our operations  to make capital expenditures and to service our debt 
the proceeds from our initial public offering in march  along with the proceeds from borrowings under our existing senior secured credit facility  were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facility 
the proceeds from our follow on offering in the fourth quarter of were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
based upon our current level of operations  we expect that our cash flow from operations  together with the amounts we are able to borrow under our existing credit facility  will be adequate to meet our anticipated needs for the foreseeable future 
to the extent we decide to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions  we will likely need to incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies related to revenue and related cost recognition  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets and accounting for income taxes to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
critical accounting policies include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
revenues and related cost recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the terms are fixed and determinable  services are performed  and collection is probable 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
pos services revenue is derived primarily from the transmission of transaction data through our networks between payment processors and pos or atm terminals 
telecommunication services revenue is derived primarily from fixed monthly recurring fees for our call signaling services and per query fees charged for our database access and validation services 
financial services revenue is derived primarily from monthly recurring fees based on the number of customer connections to and through our networks 
customer incentives granted to new customers or upon contract renewals are deferred and recognized ratably as a reduction of revenue over the contract period to the extent that the incentives are recoverable against the customers minimum purchase commitments under the contract 
in addition  we receive installation fees related to the configuration of the customer s systems 
revenue from installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the customer s contractual service period  generally three years 
we perform periodic evaluations of our customer base and establish allowances for estimated credit losses 
cost of network services is comprised primarily of telecommunications charges  which include data transmission and database access  leased digital capacity charges  circuit installation charges and activation charges 
the cost of data transmission is based on a contract or tariff rate per minute of usage in addition to a prescribed rate per transaction for certain vendors 
the costs of database access  circuits  installation charges and activation charges are based on fixed fee contracts with local exchange carriers and interexchange carriers 
the cost of network services also includes salaries  equipment maintenance and other costs related to the ongoing operation of our data networks 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we record our accrual for telecommunications charges based upon network services utilized at historical invoiced rates 
goodwill and intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests 
we have elected to perform the impairment test annually as of october of each year 
an interim goodwill impairment test is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired  we perform a recoverability evaluation based upon a determination of fair value 
in accordance with sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets including property and equipment  capitalized software development costs and identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine the recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
if we estimate that the assets are impaired  the assets are written down to their fair value 
for purposes of measuring and recognizing impairment of long lived assets  we assess whether separate cash flows can be attributed to the individual asset 
we group our long lived assets by business unit where separately identifiable cash flows are available 
in the event that long lived assets  including intangibles are abandoned or otherwise disposed of  we recognize an impairment charge upon disposition 
for our customer relationship intangible assets  we measure and recognize impairment upon the termination or loss of a customer that results in a loss of revenue 
the calculation of fair value in accordance with sfas nos 
and includes a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
our estimates of anticipated future income and cash flows used in determining fair value could be reduced significantly in the future due to changes in technologies  regulation  available financing  competition or other circumstances 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
additionally  changes in estimated future cash flows could result in a shortening of estimated useful lives for long lived assets including intangibles 
income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the effects of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
as described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recorded a valuation allowance on certain of our non us net operating loss carryforwards because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income cannot be reasonably assured 
we have non us loss carryforwards of million available as of december   the majority of which never expire under local country tax rules 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   provides for a temporary percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate percent federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
for us  the one year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is calendar year we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act  and if so  the amount that will be repatriated 
the range of reasonably possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation  which would be eligible for the temporary deduction  is zero to million 
we are awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act prior to determining the amounts we will repatriate 
we expect to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during the income tax effects of repatriation  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation  should we choose to make one  on our income tax expense for  the amount of our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings  or the amount of our deferred tax liability with respect to foreign earnings 
new accounting pronouncements the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides guidance on how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverable items contains more than one unit of accounting and  if so  requires that revenue be allocated amongst the different units based on fair value 
eitf also requires that revenue on any item in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables not delivered completely must be deferred until delivery of the item is completed 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the implementation of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
certain disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods issued after january  fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created  or in which an enterprise obtains a variable interest  after january  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february   fin applies to the first interim reporting period ending after march  we do not believe that we have invested in any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective immediately for instruments entered into or modified after may  and for all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  however  the provisions of sfas no 
will be applied to mandatorily redeemable instruments of nonpublic companies in fiscal periods beginning after december  early adoption of sfas no 
is not permitted 
application of this standard to pre existing instruments will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the provisions of this statement require that any financial instruments that are mandatorily redeemable on a fixed or determinable date or upon an event certain to occur be classified as liabilities 
our class a redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock at the option of the stockholder  and therefore it was not classified as a liability under the provisions of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows

r on july  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 
information about the fair value of stock options under the black scholes model and its pro forma impact on our net income and basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended december  which may differ from the ultimate impact of the new standard can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets of apb opinion no 
and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of intangible assets and goodwill  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and costs of network services  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our senior secured credit facility with interest rates tied to changes in the lender s base rate or the libor rate 
based upon the outstanding borrowings on december  and assuming repayment of the term loan in accordance with scheduled maturities  each increase in interest rates would add an additional million to our annual interest expense 
as of december   we did not hold derivative financial or commodity instruments and all of our cash and cash equivalents were held in money market or commercial accounts 
foreign currency risk our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared with foreign currencies  predominately the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar due to our operations in europe and australia 
we have operations in countries outside of the us  including the united kingdom  australia  canada  france  germany  ireland  italy  japan  the netherlands  new zealand  spain and sweden 
we manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of our business 
in the substantial majority of our transactions  we receive payments denominated in the us dollar  british pound  euro or australian dollar 
therefore  we do not rely on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms  which are generally short term in nature 
our policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies  and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables  which are denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain on foreign currency translation of approximately million
