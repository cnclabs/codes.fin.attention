our business consists of a single industry segment  which is the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for dentists located primarily in the domestic marketplace 
product offerings include restorative products that are permanently affixed by a dentist to a patients existing dental anatomy  including traditional porcelain fused to metal crowns and bridges and dental implants 
reconstructive products that are removable prostheses that replace missing teeth and associated structures  including partial and full dentures 
cosmetic products that consist primarily of porcelain veneers designed to enhance the appearance of the front of a tooth as well as all ceramic crowns that are made without a traditional metal substructure and more closely replicates the appearance of natural teeth 
this category also includes composite inlays and onlays  which replace silver fillings for a more natural appearance and orthodontic appliances  which are products fabricated to move existing teeth to enhance function and appearance 
internal revenue growth has been relatively flat over the past three years 
early in  we made note that the economic climate appeared to be impacting the dental laboratory industry 
in  we began to believe that many patients and dentists were postponing optimal treatment plans  such as crowns  and pursuing less expensive alternatives such as amalgam fillings  for which we recognize no revenue 
as a result  sales of restorative products were unfavorably impacted 
the general economic conditions affecting the dental laboratory industry have remained essentially unchanged during and as consumers continued this conservative practice 
we believe that while a portion of this segment can be temporarily deferred by patients  the work will eventually be required and will be done 
we have also continued to pursue an acquisition strategy  which played an important role in helping us increase sales from  in to  in however  operating margins as measured as a percentage of sales declined over this period from to 
the main cost drivers for us are the cost of labor and related employee benefits 
competition for labor resources and increases in medical insurance costs drive these costs higher 
these increased costs combined with flat internal sales growth have contributed to lower operating margins 
during  we reviewed and adjusted staffing levels at each of our locations to minimize the costs of the slowdown in sales growth 
we have been cautious about labor reductions due to the need to maintain an available and properly trained workforce in anticipation of future sales growth 
in internal sales growth  as measured by revenues from laboratories owned for both the entire year ended december  and december   remained relatively flat 
however  we experienced growth of over  in gross profit  primarily due to acquisition activity in the latter half of we also experienced cost pressure resulting from the implementation costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
due in large part to the decentralized nature of our business  approximately half of our laboratories were subject to detailed onsite testing 
the scope and complexity of the project required us to engage the accounting firm of deloitte and touche  llp 
in addition  external audit fees for pricewaterhousecoopers  llp were significantly higher than in the prior years 
the impact on these various implementation costs on the current year s earnings was approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes  with most of that occurring in the fourth quarter 
in we revised our classification of certain intangibles and recognized the value of acquired  pre existing customer relationships and trade names apart from goodwill 
consequently  we recorded approximately  in amortization expense for customer relationships and trade name impairment charges of  of which  for customer relationships and  for trade names relates to prior periods 
we expect that amortization expense for these acquired intangibles will increase in future years due to contemplated and subsequently completed acquisition activity 
trade names will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
future impairment charges may result should individual acquired laboratories experience a decline in sales 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital increased from  at december  to  at december  cash and equivalents increased  from  at december  to  at december  operating activities provided  in cash flow for the year ended december  existing cash and cash equivalents along with cash flows from operating activities were sufficient to cover cash used in investing activities 
cash outflows related to dental laboratory acquisitions totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   due in part to a lower level of acquisition activity 
during  we acquired four stand alone and three fold in laboratories compared with one stand alone and six fold in laboratories in during  we acquired approximately  in assets compared to  in capital expenditures for were  compared to  in during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock from treasury stock as directors fees at a total cost of  we maintain a stock repurchase program and may repurchase stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
we are authorized to repurchase an additional  shares as of december  we have executed a financing agreement the agreement with fleet national bank  a bank of america company the bank 
the agreement  dated june   includes a revolving line of credit of  and a revolving acquisition line of credit of  the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit is the prime rate or  at our option  the london interbank offered rate libor or a cost of funds rate plus a range of 
to depending on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
both revolving lines of credit terminate on june  an unused facility fee of one eighth of per annum is payable on the unused amount of the first revolving line of credit 
a facility fee of  per year is required on the acquisition line of credit 
at december   we had borrowed  with  remaining available  on the revolving acquisition line of credit while the full principal amount of  was available to us under the first revolving line of credit 
as of december   the interest rate associated with current borrowing was 
the agreement requires compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth and other financial ratios 
as a result of lower than expected earnings in the fourth quarter of  due mainly to the implementation costs resulting from the compliance requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  we were not in compliance with the ebitda covenant that requires specified minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  in march we borrowed against the majority of our existing acquisition facility to finance the acquisition of green dental laboratories  inc green 
as a result of this acquisition  we failed a tangible net worth financial covenant as of march  however  the bank granted relief from our financial covenants in the form of a waiver through june  as a result of the borrowing associated with the green acquisition  we believe that available financing may be insufficient to meet investments associated with future acquisitions  if any 
in order to alleviate this situation  we have agreed and the bank has committed to an additional five year credit facility of  pending the completion of executed  definitive documentation which will include modified financial covenants 
we expect to execute a definitive agreement within a reasonable period of time in we believe that cash flow from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet contemplated operating and capital requirements and deferred payments associated with prior acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than greater than total year years years years bank line of credit operating leases real estate vehicles equipment laboratory purchase obligations contingent laboratory purchase price total bank borrowings are classified as short term debt on the balance sheet 
the interest rate associated with this borrowing was 
we are committed under various non cancelable operating lease agreements covering our office space and dental laboratory facilities  vehicles and certain equipment 
certain of these leases also require us to pay maintenance  repairs  insurance and related taxes 
laboratory purchase obligations totaling  classified as deferred acquisition costs  are presented in the liability section of the balance sheet 
these obligations represent purchase price commitments arising from dental laboratory acquisitions  irrespective of laboratory earnings performance and non compete payments associated with recognized intangible assets 
contingent laboratory purchase price includes amounts subject to acquisition agreements that are tied to laboratory earnings performance  as defined within the acquisition agreements  generally over a three year period 
as payments become determinable  they are recorded as goodwill 
as sponsor of the national dentex corporation dollars plus plan  the plan  a qualified plan under section a of the internal revenue code  we have filed a retroactive plan amendment under the internal revenue service s voluntary correction program to clarify the definition of compensation in the plan 
based on our consultation with our erisa counsel  we believe this issue will be favorably resolved without requiring additional employer contributions or jeopardizing the tax qualified status of the plan 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated financial statements years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other expense interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   net sales increased  or over the prior year

net sales increased approximately  or at dental laboratories owned for both the year ended december  and the comparable year ended december  cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the fiscal year ended december  over the prior fiscal year  attributable primarily to increased unit sales 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased slightly from to 
component percentages  such as labor and benefits and materials expenses  remained virtually unchanged from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses  which consist of selling  delivery and administrative expenses both at the laboratory and corporate level  increased by  or in the year ended december  compared to operating expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in as a percentage of sales  selling expenses declined while administrative expenses at the corporate level rose sharply in compared to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of required us to engage the services of deloitte and touche  llp 
deloitte provided internal control design consultation and testing services as well as project management to help us meet our compliance obligations 
additionally  external audit fees rose sharply in connection with the sarbanes oxley reporting requirements 
as a result of these factors  we incurred an additional  in administrative costs 
beginning in  we revised our classification of certain intangibles acquired through current and prior period business combinations 
specifically  the recognition of value as assigned to customer relationship intangibles resulted in amortization expense of approximately  additionally  we recorded a charge of  to recognize impairment of acquired trade names 
selling costs declined as a percentage of sales as spending on the ndx reliance program tm  our national marketing program  was reduced from  in to  in however  we continued to invest in local marketing efforts and our local marketing costs increased from  in to  in operating income as a result of lower than expected internal sales growth  attributable in part to a continued lackluster economic climate affecting consumer decisions on dental work  additional amortization expense and increases in compliance and audit expenses discussed above  offset partially by increased operating income associated with acquisitions  our operating income declined by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income declined from in to in interest expense net interest increased  from interest income of  in to interest expense of  in  primarily as a result of a reduction in available cash coupled with the use of the line of credit to fund dental laboratory acquisitions 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by  to  in from  in the effective tax rate for fiscal year increased to for fiscal year the effective tax rate for was lower due to the finalization of certain permanent tax benefits

as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold increased from to 
increases in labor and related expenses were partially offset by decreases in materials costs 
our labor reduction program instituted during the second half of the year helped to mitigate labor costs  although health care costs continued to increase 
during the fourth quarter  we revised our health insurance plan in an attempt to control these increasing medical costs by implementing design changes and cost sharing with employees the decrease in material cost as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the continued implementation of various pricing strategies along with new supplier purchasing agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses  which consist of selling  delivery and administrative expenses both at the laboratory and corporate level  increased by  or in the year ended december  over operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in decreases in selling and incentive compensation expenses as a percentage of sales were offset slightly by increases in shipping costs 
selling costs declined as spending on the ndx reliance program tm  our national marketing program  were reduced from  in to  in  as we transitioned from the original rollout and branding phase  including development costs  into more of a maintenance mode 
other marketing costs were reduced from  in to  in in addition  commission expense decreased by approximately  in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of an ongoing restructuring of our sales force and related compensation plans that we expect will improve internal sales growth over the long term 
operating income as a result of lower than expected internal sales growth  attributable in large part to a continued unfavorable economic climate  as well as increases in labor and medical costs  partially offset by reductions in certain operation expenses  our operating income declined by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income declined from in to for interest income interest income decreased by  or in the year ended december  from the decrease was due to lower investment principal as we invested approximately  in the acquisition of dental laboratories during provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to  in from  in this  decrease was primarily the result of decreased income 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year increased to for fiscal year net income as a result of all the factors discussed above  net income decreased slightly to  or per share on a diluted basis in from  or per share on a diluted basis in critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
as released by the securities and exchange commission requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
while the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period  we do not believe our financial statements are significantly affected by complex accounting policies and methods 
a summary of certain of our significant accounting policies is presented below 
summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally as the dentists orders are shipped 
unreimbursed shipping and handling fees charged to customers which approximated  for   for  and  for are recognized upon shipment and are treated as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
shipping and handling costs totaling approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
revised classification of intangible assets in connection with our accounting for purchase business combinations  we had not historically recognized certain identifiable intangible assets  specifically customer relationships and trade names  apart from goodwill 
however  in fiscal based upon a re examination of the applicable accounting literature specifically sfas  fasb issued statement no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets and emerging issues task force abstract recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination eitf management determined that the proper accounting practice is to recognize customer relationships and trade names as separate identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in acquisitions we consummated subsequent to the applicable effective dates of sfas and eitf accordingly  we have revised our classification of intangible assets  and the associated income tax liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets 
this resulted in the recognition  apart from goodwill  of  of customer relationships and  of trade names as of december  as part of the revised classification  in we recorded a deferred tax liability of  which relates to the book versus tax basis difference associated with these customer relationships and trade name assets 
the deferred tax liability was recorded as a component of our purchase accounting for these acquisitions and accordingly increased goodwill by a corresponding amount 
the impact of this revised classification and the recognition of the associated income tax liabilities to the consolidated balance sheet was not material 
the effect of recognizing customer relationship and trade name intangibles apart from goodwill resulted in out of period charges in the first quarter of for amortization expense of  and impairment charges of  the impact of these out of period charges to the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for  and was not material 
however  because the cumulative impact  if recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  would have been material to net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal  we restated our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended march   june  and september  as reported in amended quarterly reports that we have filed on form q a 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill amortization ceased on december  we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the value of goodwill has been impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis  based on a two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
we view the individual laboratories as reporting units 
we determine fair value using factors based on revenue and operating margins 
in  and we completed both steps of the impairment testing and determined that no impairment exists at this time 
additionally  we also recognize the existence of value in trade names acquired in business combinations and believe the useful life of this intangible to be indefinite 
accordingly  trade names are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis using a single step method in accordance with sfas no 
impairment charges related to trade names are recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset 
impairment charges related to trade names were recorded in the year ended december  in the amount of  of which  relates to prior periods 
trade name impairment charges resulted from a decline in forecasted revenue at specific laboratories in comparison to revenue forecasts used in previous valuation calculations 
intangible assets subject to amortization non competition agreements and customer relationship intangibles arising from dental laboratory acquisitions are amortized over their useful lives 
the acquisition date fair value of non competition agreements are deferred and amortized over their economic useful lives  in accordance with the terms of the agreements  over to years 
the acquisition date fair value associated with acquired customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic useful life  which currently approximates years 
inventories inventories  consisting principally of raw materials  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we use estimates based on specific identification to maintain proper reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
additionally  we estimate work in process inventories by applying current labor  materials and selected overhead expense rates to standard production schedules 
we estimate the value of unrefined precious metal scrap based on the application of various return and refining statistics 
finished goods inventory consists of completed orders that were shipped to customers immediately subsequent to period end 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated depreciable lives buildings years furniture and fixtures years laboratory equipment years computer equipment years leasehold improvements and capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the assets estimated useful lives or the lease terms 
gains and losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation expense totaled approximately   and  for the year ended december   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets at each balance sheet date  management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  using certain financial indicators  such as historical and future ability to generate income from operations 
our policy is to record an impairment loss in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination is based on an evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant event  a significant change in the environment in which the business operates or if the expected future cash flows become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
cash surrender of life insurance the cash surrender value of life insurance policies are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
income taxes we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
the amount of deferred tax asset or liability is based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have considered our current financial characteristics as well as current tax law and do not believe that the recoverability of various tax assets and liabilities is impaired  and therefore have recorded them at their full value
