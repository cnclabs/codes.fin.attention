item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an asp that provides edc and other services to companies in the clinical pharmaceutical  biotechnology  cro and medical device research industries 
we assist our customers in accelerating the completion of clinical trials by streamlining the collection of data relating to clinical trials  and improving the overall quality of the clinical trial data collected 
the discussion that follows highlights our business conditions and certain financial information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents approximately of our assets  or  is held in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during  and for the first time since commencing edc operations in  we recorded operating income 
we are continuing to develop and commercialize our business  and anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we use a technology platform that consists of windows compatible software and internet hardware known as datatrak edc to provide edc and other services to clinical trial sponsors and cros 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of edc in general  as an alternative to the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  and acceptance of datatrak edc specifically 
we may be unsuccessful in achieving commercial acceptance of the datatrak process 
at december   our backlog was  compared to backlog of  at december  our december  backlog consisted of contracts with an average remaining value of  at december   our backlog consisted of contracts with an average remaining value of  our contracts in backlog at december  generated  of revenue during if we have no delays or cancellations to the contracts in backlog at december   we expect to convert approximately  of our december  backlog into revenue during our contracts can be cancelled or delayed at anytime and  therefore  our backlog  at any point in time  is not an accurate predictor of future levels of revenue 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to revenue recognition  software development costs and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our standard contracts provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered  and revenue is recognized as these components or services are delivered 
services we provide that are in addition to those provided for in our contracts are billed on a fee for service basis as services are completed 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  we recognize revenue per the specific terms of each contract 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
pass through costs that are paid directly by our customers  and for which we do not bear the risk of economic loss  are excluded from revenue 
the termination of a standard contract will not result in a material adjustment to the revenue or costs previously recognized 
in some instances  we offer volume discounts to customers over multiple contracts 
we estimate the volume discounts to be earned over the life the contracts to which the discount applies 
as contracts progress  revenue is recorded using rates that reflect the anticipated volume discount to be achieved by the customer 
the termination of a contract subject to a volume discount could result in a material adjustment to revenue previously recognized  in order to reflect the true economic value of the contract at the time of cancellation 
for the year ended december   we deferred  of revenue as a result of contracts subject to volume discounts 
no revenue was deferred in or as a result of volume discounts 
software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or 
table of contents otherwise marketed 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related product 
we perform an annual review of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are expensed 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees for stock options granted to employees and directors 
we follow the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for stock options granted to non employees 
sfas no 
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
sfas no 
requires disclosure of compensation expense under both apb no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that stock compensation be determined as if we had accounted for our stock options granted subsequent to december  under the fair value method of sfas the following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value for these options using the black scholes option pricing model 
year ended december weighted average risk free interest rate weighted average volatility of the expected market price of the common shares dividend yield weighted average expected life of the option years years years weighted average fair value per share of options granted for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the estimated value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period 
the pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had we adopted sfas no 
the following table sets forth stock based compensation and pro forma information for each period presented 
year ended december  net income loss recorded plus stock compensation expense recognized less stock compensation expense that would have been recognized under sfas no 
pro forma net income loss pro forma basic income loss per share pro forma diluted income loss per share recently issued accounting standards on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supercedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  
table of contents including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we must adopt sfas r no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not been issued 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on july  we will adopt sfas no 
using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested at the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method  and as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the adoption of sfas r will increase our operating expenses by approximately  beginning in july through december for options that remain unvested as of july  the full impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in the company s annual report on form k 
results of operations our revenue growth has been hampered by the slow growth of the edc market 
however  our revenue was able to grow from  in to  in and  in in conjunction with the growth in revenue  our operating expenses increased to  in personnel costs represented approximately  or  of our operating costs during we had approximately employees at december  our continued growth in revenue allowed us to record operating income  for the first time since commencing edc operations  in the amount of  during we recorded a net operating loss of  during our operating expenses were  including special items of  our personnel costs represented approximately of our operating expenses  or  in we had approximately employees at december  during the second half of  we took steps to reduce our annual operating costs  primarily through reductions in personnel costs 
these cost cutting measures enabled us to reduce our personnel costs to  and our total operating expenses to  during at december  we had approximately employees 
our growth in revenue together with the decrease in our operating expenses allowed us to reduce our net operating loss to  in 
table of contents the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue direct costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special items depreciation and amortization income loss from operations other income  net net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  included in revenue for the year ended december   is a one time fee of  the  fee relates to consulting work performed for a current customer that was outside of a traditional edc contract 
during the year ended december   we recorded revenue related to contracts compared to contracts during for the year ended december    of revenue was the result of contracts that were in backlog at december  and  was the result of new business 
for the year ended december    of revenue was generated from contracts that were in backlog at december  and  of revenue was the result of new business 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
additional staff and other payroll cost increases accounted for  of the  increase in third party license fees  as a result of our license agreements with microsoft and sas increased by  during other direct costs  which are primarily travel and other costs billed directly to our customers  increased by  during the year ended december  the increase in staff was necessitated by the growth in revenue and the increase in the number of contracts we have been managing over the past year 
our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the  one time revenue item caused a increase in gross margin we anticipate that our gross margin will be approximately for the year ending december  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business and software development costs  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
these expenses increased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additional staff  other payroll cost increases and our new sales incentive and corporate performance bonus plans accounted for  of the  increase 
expenses related to equipment maintenance and software licensing increased  compared to the prior year 
the increase in these expenses is related to the growth of our information technology infrastructure  and is necessary to ensure that our it infrastructure is properly maintained 
consulting costs  primarily associated with non capitalized software development and testing  increased by  during cost increases in other areas  primarily due to the increased marketing of datatrak edc  and development of the company s corporate infrastructure  resulted in additional expenses of  during the year ended december  we anticipate approximately a to sg a increase in compared to as a result of increased personnel  the requirements of sfas no 
r and growth of the business 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense fell to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the decrease was the result of aging assets  whose replacement was deferred to future periods  not being replaced as indicated by the low level of capital expenditures during of  during  we increased capital expenditure spending to a total of  and expect our depreciation and amortization expense to grow accordingly in other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which increased  for the year ended december  compared to december  primarily due to increasing interest rates  during the year 
during  we provided for us federal alternative minimum tax of  due to our net loss carryforwards  we had no other federal  state or local income tax expense in at december  we had a net operating loss carryforward of  for united states income tax purposes 
an equity transaction completed on january  has limited our net operating loss carryforwards  incurred prior to that date  to a maximum amount of  per year  under section of the internal revenue code 
all of our united states net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in the year and will be fully expired in the year the company also has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  euro for german income tax purposes with no expiration date 
due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we have fully provided for our deferred tax assets through a valuation allowance 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  included in revenue for the year ended december   is a one time fee of  the  fee relates to consulting work performed for a current customer that was outside of a traditional edc contract 
the remainder of the increase was due largely to greater acceptance of the datatrak edc software by clinical trial sponsors  resulting in an increase in the number of clinical trials using the datatrak edc software 
during  we recorded revenue related to contracts compared to contracts during direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit was  and  during and  respectively 
personnel costs decreased by  during due to the cost cutting measures implemented at the end of also during our internet service provider costs decreased by  due to decreasing rates 
these decreases were offset by a  increase in other direct costs 
these other direct costs are mainly travel expenses and other costs  which are billed to our customers 
the  decrease in direct costs combined with our increased revenue resulted in a gross margin of in compared to in sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business and software development costs  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
these expenses decreased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
staff reductions and other payroll cost savings caused personnel costs to decrease by  during the year ended december  cost reductions in other areas resulted in additional savings of  during the year ended december  the decrease in sg a expenses is consistent with what we anticipated when staff reductions and other cost cutting measures were implemented at the end of depreciation and amortization expense fell to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the decrease was the result of aging assets  whose replacement was deferred to future periods  not being replaced as indicated by the low level of capital expenditures during 
table of contents other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which decreased  for the year ended december  compared to december  primarily due to our use of cash to fund operating losses and other working capital needs 
during  we had federal alternative minimum tax of  due to income earned by our us based operations 
due to our consolidated net loss and our net operating loss carryforwards  we had no other federal  state or local income tax expense in outlook primarily due to our growth in revenue  we reported operating income for the first time in our edc history during backlog at december  of  was less than backlog reported at december  of  because new contract signings have been less than anticipated during the past year 
we are in the process of reorganizing our sales and marketing department and expect that this reorganization  along with our sas alliance and increased acceptance of edc  will lead to increased contract signings and backlog growth in we believe that shareholders can anticipate revenue to grow by approximately for the year ending december  compared to we expect our revenue to grow gradually on a quarter to quarter basis 
this growth in revenue assumes that there will be no contract delays or cancellations to current projects and we achieve our internal projections for additional new business 
we expect that approximately  of our revenue will come from contracts that were in backlog at december   and the remainder will be from contracts signed and anticipated to be signed during we expect our gross margin to be at the level for sg a expenses are expected to increase by to in as compared to our effective tax rate for is expected to be approximately due to the use of our net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
our investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures and purchases and maturities of short term investments 
in december we received approximately  in net proceeds from the completion of a private placement of our common shares 
contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received monthly as work on the contract progresses 
we record all amounts received as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
our contracting and collection practices are designed to maintain an average collection period for accounts receivable of one to three months 
any increase in our normal collection period for accounts receivable could negatively impact our cash flow from operations and our working capital 
at december   our average collection period for accounts receivable was days compared to days at december  accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  our increased revenue has caused the growth in accounts receivable 
deferred revenue was  at december  compared to  at december  cash and cash equivalents increased  during the year ended december  this was the result of  provided by financing activities  offset by  and  used by operating and investing activities  respectively 
foreign currency fluctuations caused a  decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
cash used in operating activities was the result of the company s net income of  plus non cash operating items of  this  increase was offset by the  increase in accounts receivable  caused by the company s growth in revenue during  and the  decrease in deferred revenue 
changes in other current assets and liabilities caused cash from 
table of contents operating activities to increase by  investing activities included net cash uses of  from purchases and maturities of short term investments   used to purchase property and equipment and a  decrease in our restricted cash balance 
financing activities included  in cash received from our private placement of common shares and other equity transactions  and  used to repay a capital lease obligation 
at december   we had working capital of  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  our working capital has increased by  since december  the increase was the result of the  increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  due mainly to our private placement of common shares  a  increase in accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and a  decrease in deferred revenue 
changes in other current assets and liabilities caused working capital to decrease by  we are party to a lease agreement that requires us to maintain a restricted cash balance 
our restricted cash balance was  at december  we intend to continue to fund the enhancement and testing of the datatrak edc software  as well as continue to invest in the development of the datatrak process 
our operations and the edc market are still in a developmental stage 
we have experienced revenue growth  and anticipate positive cash flow from operations during as we continue to build our customer base  increase our backlog and convert our current backlog into revenue 
we anticipate capital and related expenditures of approximately  for the twelve months ending december   for the continued commercialization and enhancement of datatrak edc 
of the  total   is required to maintain and upgrade current systems 
the remaining  is in conjunction with the anticipated growth of our business  and is to some extent discretionary 
additionally  we anticipate spending approximately  for maintenance of our information technology infrastructure during our research and development expenditures have historically been for the continued enhancement of and modifications to our datatrak edc software 
during  we anticipate spending approximately  for research and development 
research and development expenditures will increase approximately  compared to our research and development expenditures will be for the continued enhancement and modifications to our datatrak edc software  the integration datatrak edc with sas drug development software and the development of our dataunifyer product 
we expect to fund our working capital requirements  from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations 
we believe that  with the continued anticipated growth in revenue  our cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to offset delays or cancellations of contacts  support expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technology or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we may raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below shows our contractual cash obligations  expressed in thousands  at december  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations our purchase obligations consist of the payments to sas for among other things  access to the sas drug development software 
the first payment of  was made in december the payments to sas totaling  the last of which will be made by the end of january   will be expensed on a straight line basis over the two year life of the alliance agreement 
any incremental data item fees associated with the alliance will be expensed as incurred 
inflation to date  we believe that the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency risk our foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
we manage our risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar increased by approximately 
the conversion of our foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in net income that was approximately  lower than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained consistent with rates 
information about forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we anticipate will occur in the future  including statements related to future revenue  profits  expenses  income and earnings per share or statements expressing general optimism about future results  are forward looking statements 
in addition  
table of contents words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the exchange act 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions and risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
we have identified the following important factors  which could cause our actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
under no circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements contained herein to take into account events or circumstances that occur after the date of this annual report on form k 
in addition  we do not undertake any responsibility to update publicly the occurrence of unanticipated events  which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 
we have a limited operating history and we have not until recently had profitable operations 
we began providing edc services in and have a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our performance 
although we were profitable in  we had previously recognized operating losses in each year since our cumulative operating loss since from edc operations totaled  at december  we anticipate that we will be profitable in however any number of factors  including  but not limited to  termination or delays in contracts  inability to grow and convert backlog into revenue or being able to quickly reduce costs if required  could cause us to record losses in and in future periods 
if we do not continue to enhance our software  we may not be able to meet the evolving needs of our customers 
although our proprietary datatrak edc software has been used in clinical trials  continued enhancement is necessary to provide additional functions and services to meet the ever changing needs and expectations of our customers 
to date we have had limited edc revenue from which to support the costs of this continued software enhancement 
our potential future revenue may not be sufficient to absorb corporate overhead and other fixed operating costs that will be necessary for the success of the datatrak process 
our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 
we are subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including our success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which we participate  and the timing of clinical trial sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
we cannot assure you as to our revenues in any given period  and we may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of our relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition 
volatility in our quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

table of contents our business strategies are unproven and we are in an early stage of development 
our efforts to establish a standardized edc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of clinical trial sponsors 
the long term viability of our business remains unproven 
our strategy may not gain acceptance among sponsors of clinical research  research sites or investigators 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may lose revenue if we experience delays in clinical trials or if we lose contracts 
although our contracts provide that we are entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  our customers generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or our contract related to the trial at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
clinical trial sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product  or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
we may lose revenues if a clinical trial sponsor decides to delay or terminate a trial in which we participate 
we may lose future revenue if our major customers decrease their research and development expenditures  or if we lose any of our major customers 
our primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
our business is substantially dependent on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
the extent to which we rely on revenue from one customer varies from period to period  depending upon  among other things  our ability to generate new business  the timing and size of clinical trials 
in light of our small revenue base  we are more dependent on major customers than many of the larger participants in the edc industry 
during  two customers accounted for of our total revenue for the year 
our operations could be materially and adversely affected by  among other things  any economic downturn or consolidations in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  any decrease in these industries research and development expenditures  or a change in the regulatory environment in which companies in these industries operate 
changes in government regulations relating to the health care industry could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
demand for our services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of a new drug application by the fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could reduce the demand for our services 
several 
table of contents competing proposals to reform the system of health care delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
to date  none of these proposals have been adopted 
the fda s guidelines and rules related to the use of computerized systems in clinical trials are still in the early stages of development 
the datatrak process may not continue to comply with these guidelines and rules as they develop  and corresponding changes to our product may be required 
any release of fda guidance that is significantly inconsistent with the design of datatrak edc may cause us to incur substantial costs to remain in compliance with fda guidance and regulations 
we may not be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to compete in the edc market 
the edc market  which is still developing  and must compete with the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  is highly fragmented 
the major competitors  in the edc market  include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies that use paper for data collection  and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies 
our current and potential future competitors have or may have substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged  thereby gaining market share or product acceptance to our detriment 
we may not be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to effectively compete in this emerging sector of the clinical research industry 
we may be subject to liability for potential breaches of contracts or losses relating to the unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our services are supported by telecommunications equipment  software  operating protocols and proprietary applications for high speed transmission of large quantities of data among multiple locations 
in addition  clinical pharmaceutical and medical device research requires the review and handling of large amounts of patient data 
potential liability may arise from a breach of contract or a loss of or unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
if we were forced to undertake the defense of  or were found financially responsible for  claims based upon these types of losses  our financial resources could be diminished 
we maintain a  errors and omissions professional liability insurance policy to cover claims that may be brought against us 
this coverage may not be adequate  and insurance may not continue to be available to us  in the future 
we will incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters and public disclosure 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  rules adopted or proposed by the sec and by nasdaq and new accounting pronouncements will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of these laws  regulations and standards and respond to their requirements 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment will result in increased sg a expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from strategic revenue generating and cost management activities 
in addition  these new laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  on our board committees or as executive officers 
we are taking steps to comply with the recently enacted laws and regulations in accordance with the deadlines by which compliance is required  but cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs that we may 
table of contents incur to respond to their requirements  or if we will be able to timely comply with these recently enacted laws and regulations 
the price of our common shares could be adversely affected by the dilution caused by the sale of the common shares issued in our recently completed equity transaction in december  we sold  of our common shares to certain selling shareholders at a price of per share  issued warrants to purchase an additional  common shares at to those selling shareholders and issued warrants to purchase  common shares at to a placement agent  all as a result of the consummation of the share purchase agreement  dated as of december  these  common shares represent  assuming issuance of the  common shares underlying the warrants  of our outstanding common shares 
sales of a substantial number of these common shares in the public market could depress the market price of our common shares 
the perceived risk resulting from the sale of these common shares could cause some of our shareholders to sell their common shares  thus causing the price of our common shares to further decline 
in addition  the downward pressure on the price of our common shares could cause some of our shareholders to engage in short sales of our common shares  which may cause the price of our common shares to decline even further 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through short term investments and have business transactions in euros 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our interest income during the year 
foreign currency risk our foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
we manage our risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro at december  would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on our balance sheet  due to foreign currency translations 
a fluctuation in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro for the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our net income for the year ended december   due to foreign currency translations 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar increased by approximately 
the conversion of our foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in net income that was approximately  lower than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained consistent with rates
