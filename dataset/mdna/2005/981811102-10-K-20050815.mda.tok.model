processed steel products the processed steel products segment consists of two business units  worthington steel and gerstenslager 
for fiscal  fiscal  and the fiscal year ended may  fiscal  the percentage of consolidated net sales generated by the processed steel products segment was   and  respectively 
both worthington steel and gerstenslager are intermediate processors of flat rolled steel 
worthington steel occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications 
these products typically cannot be supplied as efficiently by steel mills or steel end users 
we believe that worthington steel is one of the largest independent flat rolled steel processors in the united states 
gerstenslager is a leading independent supplier of automotive quality exterior body panels to the north american automotive original equipment and past model service markets 
gerstenslager s strength is its ability to handle a large number of past model service and current model production automotive and heavy duty truck body parts 
the processed steel products segment operates manufacturing facilities throughout the united states and one consolidated joint venture  spartan steel coating  llc spartan 
together  they serve approximately  customers from these facilities  principally in the automotive  construction  lawn and garden  hardware  furniture  office equipment  electrical control  tubing  leisure and recreation  appliance  farm implement  hvac  container  and aerospace markets 
during fiscal  no single customer represented greater than of net sales for the segment 
worthington steel buys coils of steel from major integrated steel mills and mini mills and processes them to the precise type  thickness  length  width  shape  temper and surface quality required by customer specifications 
computer aided processing capabilities include  among others pickling  a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot rolled steel  slitting  which cuts steel to specific widths  cold reduction  which achieves close tolerances of thickness and temper by rolling  hot dipped galvanizing  which coats steel with zinc and zinc alloys through a hot dipped process  
table of contents hydrogen annealing  a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel  cutting to length  which cuts flattened steel to exact lengths  tension leveling  a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances for steel  edging  which conditions the edges of the steel by imparting round  smooth or knurled edges  cleancoat  a dry lubrication process  and configured blanking  which stamps steel into specific shapes 
worthington steel also toll processes steel for steel mills  large end users  service centers  and other processors 
toll processing is different from typical steel processing because the mill or end user retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product 
toll processing enhances worthington s participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders  which is a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors 
gerstenslager stamps  assembles  primes  and packages exterior automotive body parts and panels 
the steel used in the gerstenslager operations is occasionally consigned material  similar to toll processing 
gerstenslager processes a large number of past model service and current model production automotive and heavy duty truck parts  managing over  finished good part numbers and over  die fixture sets 
the processed steel products industry is fragmented and highly competitive 
there are many competitors  including other independent intermediate processors  and  with respect to automotive stamping  captive processors owned by the automotive companies  independent tier one suppliers of current model components  and a number of smaller competitors 
competition is primarily on the basis of product quality  ability to meet delivery requirements  and price 
technical service and support for material testing and customer specific applications enhance the quality of our products 
however  we have not quantified the extent to which our technical service capability has improved our competitive position 
see item business technical services 
we believe that our ability to meet tight delivery schedules is  in part  based on the proximity of our facilities to customers  suppliers  and one another 
again  we have not quantified the extent to which plant location has impacted our competitive position 
our processed steel products are priced competitively  primarily based on market factors  including  among other things  the cost and availability of raw materials  transportation and shipping costs  and overall economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
effective august   the decatur  alabama  steel processing facility and its cold rolling assets were sold to nucor corporation for million cash 
worthington steel retained the slitting and cut to length assets and net working capital associated with this facility and continues to serve customers from a portion of the decatur facility used under a long term lease 
as a result of the sale  worthington recorded a million pre tax charge during its fourth quarter of fiscal and an additional pre tax charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal  the latter mainly relating to contract termination costs 
for further discussion on this matter  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
we use our worthington steel and gerstenslager trade names in our processed steel products segment  and we use the unregistered trademark cleancoat in connection with our dry lubrication process 
we intend to continue the use of our intellectual property 
the cleancoat trademark is important to our processed steel products segment  but we do not consider it material

we compete with seven large regional or national competitors and numerous small  more localized competitors 
we compete primarily on the basis of quality  service and price 
as is the case in our processed steel products segment  the proximity of our facilities to our customers and their project sites provides us with a service advantage and impacts our freight and shipping costs 
our products are transported almost exclusively by common carrier 
we have not quantified the extent to which facility location has impacted our competitive position 
dietrich uses numerous trademarks and patents in its business 
the spazzer trademark is used in connection with wall component products that are the subject of four united states patents  one foreign patent  one pending united states patent application  and several pending foreign patent applications 
the trademark tradeready is used in connection with floor system products that are the subject of four united states patents  seventeen foreign patents  one pending united states patent application  and five pending foreign patent applications
