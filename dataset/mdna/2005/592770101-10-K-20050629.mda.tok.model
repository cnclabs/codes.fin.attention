item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources and commitments historically  we have funded our operations  acquisitions  exploration and development expenditures from cash generated by operating activities  bank borrowings and issuance of common stock 
our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure our revolving line of credit 
in fiscal  we primarily used cash provided by operations  and borrowings on the line of credit  to fund oil and gas property acquisitions and development 
we had working capital of  as of march  compared to a working capital deficit of  as of march   mainly as a result of the change in maturity date of our revolving line of credit 
in fiscal  the board of directors authorized the use of up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares  at an aggregate cost of  for the treasury account 
as part of this ongoing repurchase plan  we repurchased shares during fiscal at an aggregate cost of  during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  for the treasury account 
in december  we entered into a participation agreement with falcon bay exploration  llc exercising its right to purchase at an aggregate cash price of  the acreage and seismic data on the first of four such prospects referred to in the exploration agreement with falcon bay exploration  llc 
this information is contained in the form k we filed on december  the warrants issued related to this transaction expired  unexercised  on december  we continue to hold  undeveloped acres in the east umbrella point prospect in trinity bay  chambers county  texas and are actively pursuing partners to participate in this project and plan to drill a well prior to march  no further prospects will be generated under this exploration agreement 
during fiscal year  the company purchased a one quarter interest in leases and or options on leases in stark county  north dakota covering  gross acres for approximately  a director and employee of mexco energy corporation  will receive a orri on any wells drilled on this acreage 
during fiscal year  we elected to exercise options on approximately acres in stark county  north dakota  therefore allowing the additional options to expire or be reassigned 
during fiscal year  the company purchased partially developed royalty interests in jackson parish  louisiana for approximately  these properties are operated by anadarko petroleum corporation in the lower cotton valley formation 
in march  we purchased additional partially developed royalty interests in jackson parish  louisiana and interests in limestone county  texas for approximately  the properties in limestone county  operated by xto energy  inc  are in the cotton valley formation and contain producing wells and an additional six permitted and or drilling wells 
this acreage contains approximately potential undrilled locations on acre spacing 
the property in louisiana is operated by anadarko and produces from the lower cotton valley formation 
these royalty purchases advanced the company s primary goal of acquiring natural gas reserves 
in march  we signed an agreement in moscow  russia to begin a preliminary geological and engineering study for exploration and development of natural gas reserves in russia 
a team of us and russia experts commenced a study of a number of undeveloped oil and gas properties 
mexco energy corporation has set up obtx  llc  a delaware limited liability company  in which mexco owns a interest with the remaining interest split equally among three individuals  one of whom is arden grover  a director of mexco energy corporation 
obtx  llc plans to participate in any russian ventures entered into and own a interest 
through march   we have reviewed a number of possible projects in russia 
we established a long term investment in gaztex  llc for our capital costs of these projects of  any projects reviewed that we have decided not to continue studying or develop have been expensed 
we expensed approximately  related to russian projects in fiscal in august  we purchased partially developed royalty interests in four producing gas units in freestone county  texas with approximately producing wells for approximately  this acreage contains approximately potential undeveloped locations  which are principally cotton valley infill wells 
in february  we purchased a mineral interest in devon s aycock gas unit containing acres for approximately  the unit currently has one producing well with plans to drill two additional wells in this unit is located in freestone county  texas where the company has purchased other royalty interests 
effective february  we purchased for  partially developed royalty interests primarily located in freestone and limestone counties  texas and operated by anadarko petroleum  xto  and devon energy 
these properties contain producing wells and an additional nine permitted and or drilling wells in the cotton valley formation 
this acreage contains approximately potential undeveloped locations  which are principally cotton valley infill wells 
we continue to focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties in areas with significant development potential 
we are reviewing several other projects in which we may participate 
the cost of such projects would be funded  to the extent possible  from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations 
the remainder may be funded through borrowings on the credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na crude oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years as well as in recent months 
fluctuations in price have a significant impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
however  management believes we can maintain adequate liquidity for the next fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal oil and gas sales increased from  in to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to an increase in oil and gas prices during the year 
the average oil price increased from per bbl in to per bbl in  an increase of per bbl or 
the average gas price increased from in to per mcf in  an increase of 
per mcf or 
oil production decreased from  bbls in to  bbls in  a decrease of  bbls or 
gas production decreased from  mcf in to  mcf in  a decrease of  mcf or 
such decreases primarily were due to normal decline in production 
production costs decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  or 
this is primarily attributable to a decreased number of repairs on operated properties during the year and a decrease in production units 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to a decrease in production 
there was no impairment of oil and gas properties in fiscal or general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the russian venture 
organization costs directly related to forming obtx  llc was  there was also an increase in contract and consulting services that were directly related to russian projects that we decided to discontinue totaling approximately  interest expense increased from  in to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to increased borrowings and increased interest rates during the current fiscal year 
income tax expense increased from  in to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to the utilization of part of the statutory depletion carryforward in fiscal due to increased pre tax income

this decrease was attributable to decreased borrowings during the current fiscal year 
alternative capital resources although we have primarily used cash from operating activities and funding from the line of credit as our primary capital resources  we have in the past  and could in the future  use alternative capital resources 
these could include the sale of assets and or issuances of common stock through a public offering 
we could also obtain funds through a private placement 
contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our future payments we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of march  payments due in total year years years contractual obligations secured bank line of credit   these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the bank line of credit 
these repayments assume that interest will be paid on a monthly basis and that no additional funds will be drawn 
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes  fair value and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
in  the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our crude oil and natural gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us more susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher crude oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  o and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
use of estimates 
in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
significant estimates affecting these financial statements include the estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  the related present value of estimated future net cash flows and the future development  dismantlement and abandonment costs 
revenue recognition 
we recognize crude oil and natural gas revenue from our interest in producing wells as crude oil and natural gas is sold from those wells  net of royalties 
we utilize the sales method to account for gas production volume imbalances 
under this method  income is recorded based on our net revenue interest in production taken for delivery 
we had no material gas imbalances 
excluded costs 
oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
these costs are excluded until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated by by the units of production method 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in the full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
long term investment in gaztex  llc 
the company accounts for its investment in a limited liability company on the equity basis and adjusts the investment balance to agree with its equity in the underlying assets of the entity 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  provides guidance on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production as provided for in the american jobs creation act of jobs act 
fsp fas provides that the deduction should be treated as a special deduction under paragraph of sfas no 
this deduction takes effect beginning in and therefore  has no impact on the current year financial statements 
we are currently assessing the effect of fas on the fiscal financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires that the cost from all share based payment transactions  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to account for these share based payments 
for public companies  sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal and are currently assessing the effect of sfas r on the financial statements 
the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  by oil and gas producing entities that follow the full cost accounting method 
sab no 
 which was adopted in the third quarter of fiscal  states that after adoption of sfas no 
 the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet should be excluded from the present value of estimated future net cash flows used for the full cost ceiling test calculation 
it also states that estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs in future development activities be included in the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have any material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk factors all of the company s financial instruments are for purposes other than trading 
at march   the company had not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other similar agreements relating to crude oil and natural gas 
interest rate risk 
the company s variable rate bank debt is tied to prime rate 
if the interest rate on the company s bank debt increases or decreases by one percentage point  the company s annual pretax income would change by credit risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by counter parties of their contractual obligations 
the company s primary credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized 
at march   the company s largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was  the company has not experienced any significant credit losses 
energy price risk 
our most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas and crude oil 
our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty and expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a noncash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly  even if it is only for a short period of time 
see critical accounting policies and estimates ceiling test under item of this form k 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
if the average oil price had increased or decreased by one cent per barrel for fiscal  our pretax income would have changed by if the average gas price had increased or decreased by one cent per mcf for fiscal  our pretax income would have changed by  uncertainty of reserve information and future net revenue estimates 
estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as future production  oil and gas prices  operating costs  development costs and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
as a result  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas and of future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our reserves will ultimately be produced or that any undeveloped reserves will be developed 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
reserve replacement risk 
our future success depends upon its ability to find  develop or acquire additional  economically recoverable oil and gas reserves 
our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that we can find  develop or acquire replacement reserves 
one offset to the obvious benefits afforded by higher product prices especially for small to mid cap companies in this industry  is that quality domestic oil and gas reserves are becoming harder to find 
reserves to be produced from undiscovered reservoirs appear to be smaller  and the risks to find these reserves are greater 
reports from the energy information administration indicate that on shore domestic finding costs are on the rise  and that the average reserves added per well are declining 
drilling and operating risks 
drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks  including availability of workover and drilling rigs  well blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gases and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
in addition  we incur the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered and there is no assurance that we will recover all or any portion of its investment in wells drilled or re entered 
marketability of production 
the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions could all affect our ability to produce and market our oil and gas
