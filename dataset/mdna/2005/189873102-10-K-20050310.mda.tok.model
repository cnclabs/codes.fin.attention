outstanding options are marked to market with market value changes recognized in current earnings 
the us treasury bond futures options generally have terms ranging from to days 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   including variable or floating rate debt and derivatives used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate preferred stocks  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
