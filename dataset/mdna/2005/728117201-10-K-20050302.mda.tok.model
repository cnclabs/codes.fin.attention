item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception in as the publisher of playboy magazine  we have become a world leader in the development and distribution of multimedia entertainment for adult audiences 
today  our businesses are classified into three reportable segments entertainment  publishing and licensing 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the realignment of our existing online and entertainment segments into a combined entertainment group 
the new operating structure is designed to streamline operations  maximize return on content creation and increase responsiveness to customers 
prior periods have been restated to reflect the realignment of our reportable segments 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
revenues today we generate most of our entertainment group revenues from ppv fees for our television network offerings  including playboy tv and spice branded domestic and international networks 
our network revenues are affected by marketing and retail price  which are controlled by the distributors  our revenue splits with distributors  which are negotiated  and the demand for our programming 
we believe tv revenues will increasingly be generated from vod and svod technologies 
internationally  we own and operate or license playboy  spice and locally branded tv and movie networks  and we have equity interests in seven additional networks through joint ventures 
we also receive licensing fees from playboy websites outside of the united states 
subscription revenues from our multiple club websites  which offer unique playboy or spice branded content  e commerce sales of playboy and spice branded and other consumer products  both online and through direct mail  and fees from licensing our content to wireless providers also contribute to entertainment group revenues 
other entertainment group revenues include the sale of dvds and home videos  website advertising and online gaming 
the majority of our publishing group revenues are derived from circulation  both subscription and newsstand sales  of playboy magazine and special editions 
additionally  the group generates advertising sales from playboy magazine  as well as royalties on circulation and advertising  from our licensed international editions 
our subscription revenues are fairly consistent  while newsstand sales fluctuate and are typically higher for issues containing celebrity pictorials or other special content  such as articles or interviews 
the group s revenues fluctuate with the general condition of the local and national economy  which impacts newsstand sales as well as advertising buying patterns 
revenues can also fluctuate when we increase the price of holiday or other special issues and issues containing major celebrities 
licensing group revenues are principally generated from royalties received for the international and domestic licensing of our brand on consumer and entertainment products as well as periodic auction sales of small portions of our art and memorabilia collection 
in the future  revenues will also be generated from location based entertainment projects 
costs and operating expenses entertainment group expenses include programming amortization  online content  network distribution  hosting  sales and marketing and administrative expenses as well as trademark license and administrative fees to the parent company 
amortization and content expenses relate to the expenditures associated with the creation of playboy programming  the licensing of third party programming for our movie networks and the creation of online content for our websites 
publishing group expenses include manufacturing  subscription promotion  editorial  shipping and administrative expenses 
manufacturing  which includes the production of the magazine  represents the largest cost of the group and fluctuates by issue due mainly to the cost of paper and the number of pages in the magazine 
postage is also a major cost 
licensing group expenses include agency fees and promotional and administrative expenses 
corporate administration and promotion expenses include general corporate costs such as technology  legal  security  human resources  finance  investor relations and company wide marketing  communications and promotion  including expenses related to the playboy mansion

operating income increased million in primarily due to improved operating results from each of our groups  offset in part by higher planned corporate administration and promotion expenses 
net income of million for the current year included a million insurance recovery partially related to a charge recorded in the prior year for a litigation settlement with logix 
the current year included million of debt extinguishment expenses related to the second quarter bond redemption  comprised of million for the bond redemption premium and approximately million for the non cash write off of the related deferred financing costs 
the previous year included million of debt extinguishment expenses related to prior financing obligations  which were paid upon completion of our debt offering in  as well as an million charge for the litigation settlement mentioned above 
entertainment group the following discussion focuses on the profit contribution of each of our entertainment group businesses before programming amortization and online content expenses 
revenues from our domestic tv networks business increased million  or  for this improvement resulted from both a million increase in dth revenues related to subscriber growth and a million increase in vod revenues  due to the rollout of vod service in additional cable systems 
the launch of playboy hot hd and revenues associated with renting our studio facility and providing various related services to third parties also contributed favorably to revenues 
the revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in ppv buys as cable companies are migrating consumers from linear channels to vod 
additionally  certain affiliates of time warner cable inc  or time warner  one of our msos  replaced our movie networks with other adult programming before we signed a new carriage agreement with time warner in july 
we have regained some of our market share via vod  and the time warner deal guarantees us a majority of the adult vod shelf space on its systems 
the second quarter of was also negatively impacted by a one time million unfavorable adjustment to movie network revenues from an unanticipated retroactive rate reduction related to the acquisition of one large mso by another 
profit contribution for domestic tv networks increased million  or  for the year  as the revenue activity described above was mostly offset by higher distribution and overhead costs related to the operation of our production facility  combined with increased marketing  promotional and legal expenditures 
in  we anticipate growth opportunities in our domestic tv business to result from expected increases in digital home coverage and from the further rollout of vod and svod 
we anticipate this growth despite the ongoing decline of traditional  linear networks and a difficult negotiating environment with cable and satellite distributors as a result of industry consolidation 
international revenues increased million  or  in primarily attributable to higher dth and cable revenues in the uk of approximately million resulting from the launch of three new channels and the impact of foreign currency 
higher international online revenues of approximately million also contributed to the increase 
profit contribution from our international business increased million  or  in based on the higher revenues and offset in part by higher direct and overhead costs related to the launch of the three new uk channels 
online subscription revenues increased million  or  in due to an increase in average monthly subscribers and an increase in our revenues per subscriber as more customers continue to choose video rich offerings via broadband 
higher costs of sales and technology costs partially offset the revenue increase 
e commerce revenues increased million  or  in due to increased catalog circulation combined with increased email campaigns 
profit contribution from e commerce was partially impacted by higher marketing and circulation costs 
profit contribution from other businesses increased million  or  in due to a one time million favorable adjustment in the current year from the reversal of an accrual recorded in and related to the termination of a service agreement 
growth in our online advertising and online gaming businesses also contributed to the increase 
these increases were mostly offset by a decrease in worldwide dvd profit contribution of million  or  as a result of fewer titles released in the current year combined with an increase in marketing expenses 
the group s administrative expenses increased in mainly due to a contractually obligated severance charge combined with higher legal expenses 
the group s results included net fees of million in both and from playboy 
com to corporate administration and promotion and the publishing group for the use of the parent company s trademarks and content 
programming amortization and online content expenses increased million  or  compared to the prior year due to the mix of programming 
in  we anticipate a reduction in programming investments due partially to our strategic decision to focus on vod and svod programming  which requires us to supply less programming to msos 
segment income for the group increased million  or  mainly due to the previously mentioned higher operating income from each of our lines of business  partially offset by increased administration and programming amortization expense 
publishing group playboy magazine revenues decreased million  or  in newsstand revenues in were million lower principally due to more celebrity issues plus the th anniversary issue which sold at higher cover prices in the prior year combined with a decrease in the number of us and canadian newsstand copies sold and higher display costs in the current year 
subscription revenues increased million primarily due to a favorable adjustment for subscriptions that will not be served  higher net subscription revenue per copy as a result of a higher proportion of direct to publisher subscriptions  higher list rental revenues and a favorable bad debt reserve adjustment 
a slight decrease in the number of subscription copies served partially offset the above mentioned revenue increases 
advertising pages increased slightly while net revenue per page decreased slightly  resulting in flat advertising revenues  as expected  mostly due to the favorable impact of the playboy th anniversary issue in the prior year 
advertising sales for the first quarter magazine issues are closed  and we expect to report higher advertising pages and lower advertising revenues compared to the first quarter as a result of a soft first quarter 
revenues from our other domestic publishing businesses decreased million  or  primarily due to fewer copies sold and higher display costs for special editions 
two fewer calendars published in the current year also contributed to the decline  which was offset by higher royalties from books 
international publishing revenues increased million  or  primarily due to higher revenues from several international editions 
the group s segment income increased million in primarily due to lower manufacturing and promotion costs as a result of the th anniversary issue combined with the costs associated with moving our editorial functions from chicago to new york in the prior year 
partially offsetting the impact of these lower costs were higher editorial costs related to celebrity pictorials in the current year and the lower revenues discussed above 
our circulation rate base for the six months ended december  was million 
according to abc  our circulation was below our circulation rate base for in  we expect significantly higher paper costs combined with higher subscription acquisition expenses to meaningfully decrease group profitability 
licensing group licensing group revenues increased million  or  in mainly due to higher royalties from our international and entertainment products businesses 
international revenues increased million  or  due to new licensee agreements in addition to higher royalties from existing licensees in japan  europe  southeast asia and australia 
entertainment licensing revenues increased million  or  primarily due to higher royalties from our bally s slot machine deal 
other revenues were million lower than last year  due to the sale of an original salvador dali painting and th anniversary auction of art  manuscripts and memorabilia in segment income for the licensing group in increased million  or  on the above mentioned net revenue increase 
in the first quarter of  we sold our sarah coventry trademarks and service marks for their approximate book value  pursuant to an agreement under which we will receive payments over a period not to exceed ten years 
corporate administration and promotion corporate administration and promotion expenses for increased million  or  which was less than the expected increase and was related to higher salary  marketing  consulting and legal expenses 
restructuring expenses in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the realignment of our entertainment and online businesses 
in addition  we recorded additional charges of million related to the restructuring plan  due to excess office space  and reversed million related to the restructuring plan as a result of changes in plan assumptions 
of the total costs related to all our restructuring plans  approximately million was paid by december   with most of the remainder to be paid in  however  some payments continue through in  primarily due to excess space in our chicago office  we recorded unfavorable adjustments of million and million to the previous estimates related to the and restructuring plans  respectively 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge  of which million related to the termination of employees and million related to the consolidation of our office spaces in los angeles and chicago 
in  we implemented a restructuring plan that included a reduction in workforce coupled with vacating portions of certain office spaces 
total restructuring charges of million were recorded  including million recorded in as an unfavorable adjustment to the original estimate 
of the million  million related to the termination of employees and million related to the excess office spaces in chicago and new york

lower interest expense as a result of the debt restructuring also contributed to the decrease 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for further information on the debt restructuring 
debt extinguishment expenses of million related to the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes from the proceeds of our equity offering in the second quarter of in  we incurred million of debt extinguishment expenses related to the retirement of debt obligations 
income taxes our effective income tax rate differs from us statutory rates primarily as a result of the reduction in the valuation allowance corresponding to the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  the benefit from which was partially offset by foreign income and withholding tax  for which no current us income tax benefit is recognized  and the deferred tax treatment of certain indefinite lived intangibles 
in  we decreased the valuation allowance by million  of which million was due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset related to net income and the remainder was primarily due to the expiration of a portion of our capital loss carryforward and the deferred tax treatment of certain acquired intangibles 
in  we increased the valuation allowance by million  of which million was due to the deferred tax treatment of certain acquired intangibles and the remainder was primarily due to the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss 
compared to our revenues increased approximately million  or  in compared to the prior year largely due to the restructuring of our international tv joint ventures and the resulting consolidation of certain of these businesses in our operating results 
higher newsstand and advertising revenues for the th anniversary issue combined with higher online subscription  e commerce and licensing revenues also contributed to the overall increase 
operating income improved to million  more than double the prior year  largely due to the swing in profitability of our internet businesses as a result of growth in high margin online subscription revenues 
increased playboy magazine revenues also contributed to the improvement 
all groups reported positive performance despite the expected decrease in worldwide dvd revenues and operating income 
also affecting the comparison was a million restructuring charge taken in compared to a million restructuring charge in net loss for included an million charge related to a litigation settlement with logix as well as million of debt extinguishment expenses in connection with financing obligations  which were repaid upon completion of our debt offering in the first quarter of in  we recorded a million non cash income tax charge related to our adoption of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
entertainment group the following discussion focuses on the profit contribution of each of our entertainment group businesses before programming amortization and online content expenses 
revenues from our domestic tv networks business increased million  or  for the year 
the increase was due  in part  to increases in digital home coverage  however  revenues continued to be negatively impacted by theft of service  which we also believe is an area of focus for the dth and cable operators 
we also believe that revenues have been impacted by customer resistance to increases in total prices for services and the resulting dissatisfaction with the overall value of digital service 
in general  our networks are digital services  carried by dth and cable operators  and we are therefore negatively affected by customer churn in digital cable 
the year reflected higher revenues related to playboy tv en espanol 
profit contribution for our domestic tv networks increased million  or  in  which was impacted by lower amortization of intangibles acquired in the califa acquisition  offset in part by higher distribution costs and overhead related to our first year in our new production facility 
we also utilized our studio to provide playback  production control and origination services for third parties  which helped bring efficiencies and allowed us to spread our fixed costs to operate the facility 
in december  we completed the restructuring of the ownership of our international tv joint ventures with claxson 
the restructuring resulted in our acquiring full ownership of playboy tv and movie networks outside of the united states and canada  other than latin america and iberia 
the operating results of these networks are now consolidated in our operating results 
prior to the restructuring  we recorded only revenues from licensing and other fees in our operating results

revenues from our online subscription business increased million  or  due to growth in members and higher pricing of our various clubs  as well as the launch of new clubs 
e commerce revenues increased million  or  partly due to increased catalog circulation and improved marketing strategy for the spice catalog  combined with increased email campaigns and special offers for playboystore 
com 
profit contribution from other businesses decreased million  or  due in part to a revenue decrease from our worldwide dvd business of approximately million  or 
revenues decreased due to fewer domestic titles released compared to  as expected  and due to the absence of revenues from a large korean contract  which were recorded in lower online advertising revenues  partially caused by our decision to internally utilize the premium advertising space to drive traffic to our revenue generating websites  also contributed to the decrease 
the group s administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher legal expenses related to the litigation with logix in that were incurred prior to the settlement 
the group s results included net fees of million and million in and  respectively  to corporate administration and promotion and the publishing group for use of the parent company s trademarks and content

subscription revenues were essentially flat in compared to other domestic publishing revenues increased million  or  for compared to the prior year primarily due to higher revenues from sales of special editions resulting from the full year impact of the price increases  which more than offset a decline in average copies sold per issue 
the group s segment income nearly doubled from million in to million in partially offsetting the revenue increases stated above were higher magazine editorial costs due to celebrity pictorials and higher advertising and promotion costs related to the th anniversary issue  combined with the costs associated with moving playboy s editorial functions from chicago to new york

higher brand licensing royalties from our international and entertainment products businesses contributed to the revenue increase

revenue recognition playboy magazine our playboy magazine revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which and were derived from newsstand sales in the respective years

our expected sales are based on historical analyses of demand based on a number of variables  including content  time of year and the cover price 
we record our revenues for each month s issue utilizing our expected sales 
our revenues are recorded net of a provision for estimated returns 
substantially all of the magazines to be returned are returned within days of the date that the subsequent issue goes on sale 
we adjust our provision for returns based on actual returns of the magazine 
historically  our annual adjustments to playboy magazine newsstand revenues have not been material and are driven by differences in consumer demand as compared to expected sales

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to manage the risk associated with our exposure to such fluctuations  we enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we have derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  which are entered into in order to hedge the variability of cash flows to be received related to forecasted royalty revenues denominated in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge these royalties with forward contracts for periods not exceeding months 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions 
we link all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
effective with the refinancing of our financing obligations  which occurred on march   we no longer have any floating interest rate exposure 
all of our current debt is represented by the senior secured notes  which are fixed rate obligations 
on june   we used a portion of the proceeds from our equity offering in april to redeem million of the million outstanding balance 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that was scheduled to mature in may that effectively converted million of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
in march  in connection with the termination of our former credit facility  we also terminated this swap agreement for million 
the fair value of the outstanding million senior secured notes will be influenced by changes in market rates and our credit quality 
at december   the notes were trading above par for an implied fair value of million 
we prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a hypothetical devaluation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of the countries to which we have exposure  primarily japan and germany 
based on our sensitivity analyses at december  and  such a change in foreign currency exchange rates would affect our annual consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows by approximately million and million  respectively
