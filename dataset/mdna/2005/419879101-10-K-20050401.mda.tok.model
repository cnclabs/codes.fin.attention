item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed in more detail under business chapter reorganization of hawaiian  on march   hawaiian filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
hawaiian holdings did not file for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as discussed above  the trustee has been put in charge of operating hawaiian s business 
the filing of the trustee motion created significant uncertainty regarding the ability of hawaiia n to facilitate a timely reorganization allowing us to regain full control of hawaiian in a relatively short period of time 
as a result  effective april   we deconsolidated hawaiian and prospectively accounted for our ownership of hawaiian using the cost method of accounting 
accordingly  our financial results include the consolidated results of us and hawaiian for all of and the first quarter of  and our stand alone deconsolidated results for the last three quarters of this has resulted in historical operating results that are not comparable on a year to year basis 
we anticipate that hawaiian will emerge from bankruptcy in the latter half of april however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to consummate the joint plan successfully and that we will regain full control of hawaiian 
accordingly  the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is directed toward stand alone deconsolidated results for the periods for which hawaiian s results were not consolidated with ours  and our consolidated result s for the periods for which hawaiian s results were consolidated with ours 
in addition  our liquidity discussion focuses only on our stand alone deconsolidated liquidity position 
following the anticipated emergence of hawaiian from bankruptcy in the latter half of april  we will file a form k containing pro forma financial statements to report the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of holdings and hawaiian 
there are a number of items that may be relevant for a discussion and analysis of hawaiian s results of operations  current business and industry developments and liquidity position that we will not discuss because we do not control hawaiian 
hawaiian s chapter reorganization is discussed under business chapter reorganization of hawaiian 
in addition  summary financial information for hawaiian is included in note to the financial statements included herein and hawaiian s audited financial statements as of december  and  and for each of the three years ended december  are included in this form k beginning on page f results of operations this discussion analyzes our operations for the fiscal years ended december   and the following information should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
prior to the bankruptcy of hawaiian we consolidated hawaiian because we controlled hawaiian through our ownership of all of the voting stock of hawaiian 
following the petition date  we expected to regain full control of hawaiian in a relatively short period of time 
we had re negotiated hawaiian s collective bargaining agreements with its pilots  mechanics  and flight attendants prior to filing bankruptcy  had minimal secured debt or other secure d non aircraft claims  and then current management believed that hawaiian s operating leases could be re negotiated in a short period of time through the chapter bankruptcy process 
furthermore  we and hawaiian continued to have both a common board of directors and common management 
as a result  we continued to consolidate hawaiian through march  however  the filing o f the trustee motion created significant uncertainty regarding our ability to facilitate a timely reorganization and regain full control of hawaiian in a relatively short period of time 
this uncertainty was further confirmed on may   upon the bankruptcy court s issuance of the order granting the truste e motion  which resulted in the appointment of the trustee  instead of the common board of directors and common management of us and hawaiian 
as a result  effective april   we deconsolidated hawaiian and prospectively accounted for our ownership of hawaiian using the cost method of accounting 
accordingly  our results of operations include the operating results of hawaiian through march   but for no subsequent periods 
due to the deconsolidation of hawaiian  our financial statements and certain footnotes included therein do no t reflect comparable business activity on a year to year basis 
the statemen t of operations includes the consolidated operating results of holdings and hawaiian through march   and the deconsolidated results of holdings only  which consists substantially of corporate expenses included in other operating expenses  for the period from april  to december  the and statements of operations include the consolidated operating results of holdings and hawaiian for the entire year 
for the periods indicated  the following table presents a breakdown of the components of operating revenue and expenses as well as the percentage relationship that these items bear to the total operating revenue and the percentage increase decrease in the dollar amounts of such items

activity related to the restructuring charges for the years ended december  and  is set forth in greater detail in note to the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowance during the year ended december   we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that any portion of our net deferred tax assets would be realized and therefore recognized a full valuation allowance on our net deferre d tax assets as of the beginning of the year  net deferred tax assets generated during the year including net operating loss carryforwards  and items directl y impacting other comprehensive loss primarily the minimum pension liability 
a s a result  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by million during the year ended december  of this increase  millio n relates to increased valuation allowances for the deferred tax effect of curren t year losses and the valuation allowance on the opening net deferred tax asset  million relates to increased valuation allowances for the deferred tax asset attributable to the minimum pension liability  and the remainder relates to an increase in deferred tax assets attributable to other comprehensive loss items 
the valuation allowance of hawaiian was eliminated upon the deconsolidation of hawaiian on april  deferred tax assets at december  related to holdings only 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realizability of those assets  a valuation allowanc e has been recorded for the full amount 
as of december   we had total ne t operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  the net operating loss carryforwards will expire between the years and liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  and million of restricted cash 
our working capital deficit a t december  was million  as compared with million at december  current liabilities at december  consisted of accounts payable  accrued legal and professional fees and amounts due to related parties including million due to hawaiian that is primarily related to shared cost s paid by hawaiian and allocated to us prior to hawaiian s bankruptcy filing 
in  we used million of cash in operating activities  including million of cash for professional fees related to hawaiian s bankruptcy proceedings

we used million of cash in investing activities in for purchases of property and equipment by hawaiian in the first quarter 
we also used million of cash in financing activities to pay down long term debt and capital lease obligations 
as a holding company  holdings did not have any contractual obligations as of december  other than liabilities payable to hawaiian and smith management llc smith management  each as described below 
subsequent to our corporate restructuring in august  hawaiian paid certain expenses on our behalf  generally relating to our obligations as a public company 
in addition  hawaiian transferred million  which is recorded as restricted cash  to us immediately prior to hawaiian s bankruptcy filing 
we ha d million due to hawaiian as of december  also  we had approximately million due to smith management as of december  related to corporate amounts paid by smith management to third parties on behalf of holdings to fund costs associated with maintaining holdings statu s as a public company  costs related to preparing a plan of reorganization for hawaiian  and other obligations of holdings 
as described in greater detail in item under business chapter reorganization of hawaiian  the consummation of the joint plan will involve certain financial obligations on our part 
we and rc aviation have agreed  pursuant to the restructuring support agreement  to raise debt financing for hawaiian as described therein in order to meet the distribution and payment obligations under the joint plan and to ensure that hawaiian has at least the minimum amount of cash required by the joint plan 
to that end  we and rc aviation are in the process of negotiating a million senior secured credit facility as well as the issuance of up to million of convertible senior notes 
the incurrence of any such indebtedness is contingent upon  among other things  the confirmation of the joint plan 
see chapter reorganization of hawaiian financing arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation s are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies for periods when hawaiian was consolidated are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
passenger revenue is recognized either when the transportation is provided or when the related ticket expires unused 
the value of unused passenger tickets is included as air traffic liability 
hawaiian performs periodic evaluations of this estimated liability  and any adjustments resulting therefrom  which can be significant  are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed 
charter and cargo revenue is recognized when the transportation is provided 
mileage credits are sold in the hawaiianmiles frequent flyer program to participating partners such as hotels  car rental agencies and credit card companies 
revenue from the sale of mileage credits was deferred and  beginning in  recognized as passenger revenue when transportation was likely to be provided  based on the fair value of the transportation to be provided 
prior t o  these amounts were recognized on a comparable basis but were classified a s other revenue 
the related amounts in the statements of operations for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
amounts in excess of the fair value of the transportation to be provided are recognized currently as a reduction in marketing expenses 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we accounted for hawaiian s defined benefit pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards  employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
and its other postretirement benefit plans using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 

under both sfas no 
and sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
expense calculated under sfas no 
and sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for the defined benefit pension plans of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and other postretirement benefit expense of million and million the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amounts for the year ended december  represent only the period during which we consolidated hawaiian 
the calculation of pension expense and our pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
we assumed that our plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of at december   which is unchanged from the rate used at december we developed our expected long term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans assets  including the trustee s review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
pension expense increase s as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by basis points from to would have increased our estimated full year pension by approximatel y million 
we discounted both our future pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations using a rate of at december   compared to at december  we determined the appropriate discount based on the current rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the tw o highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by basis points from to would have increased our pension and other postretirement liabilities at december  by approximately million and million  respectively  and increased our estimated full year pension and other postretirement benefits expenses by approximately million and million  respectively 
impairments of long lived assets 
we recorded impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations  primarily property and equipment and airport operating rights  when events and circumstances indicated that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets were less than the carrying amount of those items 
cash flow estimates were based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of futur e market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable were reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represented our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we provided an allowance for spare parts inventory obsolescence over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft  plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as excess 
these allowances were based on our estimates an d industry trends  which are subject to change  and  where available  reference t o market rates and transactions 
the estimates are more sensitive when we near th e end of a fleet life or when we remove entire fleets from service sooner than originally planned 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilized a number of estimates in accounting for our hawaiianmiles frequent flyer program that are consistent with industry practices 
we recorded a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that includes the cost of incremental fuel and meals an d does not include any costs for aircraft ownership  maintenance  labor or overhead allocation 
stock compensation 
we account for stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
under apb  no compensation expense i s recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price of the stock option is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we disclose pro forma information regarding what our net loss would have been i f we had accounted for option grants using the fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock base d compensation sfas 
we estimated the fair value of our stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
in december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  and supersedes apb sfas r requires that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r also requires that tax benefit s associated with these stock based payments be classified as financing activitie s in the statement of cash flow rather than operating activities as currently permitted 
sfas r will be effective for periods beginning after june  sfas r offers alternative methods of adoption 
at the present time  we have not yet determined which alternative method it will use 
depending on the method we adopt to calculate stock based compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r  the pro forma disclosure included in our financial statements may not be indicative of the stock based compensation expense to be recognized in periods beginning after june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a holding company with no operations  hawaiian is not subject to any materia l market risk 
market risk information is not provided for hawaiian  the business of which has been operated under the jurisdiction of the trustee since may as described in greater detail in business chapter reorganization
