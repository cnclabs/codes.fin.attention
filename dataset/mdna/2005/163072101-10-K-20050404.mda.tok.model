item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements we began a review of our lease accounting policies following announcements in december that several restaurant companies were revising their accounting practices for leases 
in february  the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing the sec staff s views relating to certain lease accounting issues 
as a result of our review  we changed our accounting for leases in fiscal and restated our historical financial statements and certain financial information for prior periods to correct errors in our lease accounting policies 
the restatement adjustments are non cash and had no impact on revenues or net cash flows 
we do not consider the differences in prior years annual financial statements to be material 
the changes to our lease accounting policies fall into the following categories 
contingent rent we lease all of our restaurant locations under operating lease agreements with terms of approximately to years 
most of these agreements require us to pay contractual annual rent minimum base rent plus contingent rent based on a percentage of restaurant sales to the extent this amount exceeds the minimum base rent 
the lease agreements also generally include scheduled increases in the minimum base rent 
in prior periods  we recorded rent expense for the greater of the minimum base rent  as adjusted for scheduled increases over the lease term  or the contingent rent based on a percentage of sales 
as our restaurants have consistently operated at very high volumes  contingent rent historically was in excess of such minimum base rent 
consequently  with respect to leases requiring contingent rent payment  our accounting for rent expense reflected the contingent rent amount 
we have determined that in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 determining contingent rentals  we should have recorded the straight lined minimum base rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
total rent expense over the term of the lease will not change as a result of this correction in accounting treatment 
based on our experience of consistently achieving sales requiring the payment of contingent rent  this adjustment will increase rent expense in the first half of the lease term and likewise decrease rent expense in the second half of the lease term 
rent holiday historically  we began the recognition of rent expense with the stated rent commencement date generally the date we open to the public according to the lease 
we have determined that in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  we should have included the rent holiday period  which is defined as the date from when we began our tenant improvements to the property until the stated rent commencement date per the lease  as part of the lease term for purposes of straight lining minimum base rent 
of the rent allocated to the rent holiday period  the portion incurred during the tenant improvement construction phase can be capitalized 
once construction is complete and the building is ready for its intended use  rent for the remainder of the holiday period should be expensed 
landlord contributions we often receive landlord contributions of monies to offset the costs of constructing structural components for the leased space 
these monies can be direct cash reimbursements or offsets to minimum or percentage rent payments over the term of the lease 
historically  we have netted these reimbursements against the cost incurred by the company for the structural components and depreciated the net amount over the lease term 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  emerging issues task force eitf no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction and sfas no 
 accounting for leases  emerging issues task force eitf no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  sfas no 
 accounting for leases sale leaseback transactions involving real estate  sales type leases of real estate  definition of the lease term  and initial direct costs of direct financing leases  we should have accounted for each operating lease based on the following criteria landlord contributions received in the form of offsets to percentage rent should be recorded as a reduction to rent expense in the period earned 
in those cases where we did not meet the criteria of eitf for being deemed the owner of the structural components of the building during the construction period  we should have recorded the amounts incurred for those structural components as increases to prepaid rent and the associated landlord contributions earned as deductions to prepaid rent 
upon completion of construction  the net balance should have been amortized over the term of the lease as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
in those cases where we did meet the criteria of eitf for being deemed the owner of the structural components of the building  we should have been considered the owner of those structural components during the construction period and we should have recorded amounts paid for these components as construction in progress and the associated landlord construction contributions as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction  for those leases that qualified for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 we should have removed the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress and the difference should have been reclassified to prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
for those leases that did not qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 we should have amortized the deemed landlord financing liability over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
we restated our consolidated balance sheet at december  and the consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended december  and december  the adjustments associated with the above corrections in our accounting for leases reduced net income by  and  and had no impact on diluted net income per share for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
these adjustments also resulted in a  reduction in retained earnings as of january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on restatement adjustments 
we also restated the quarterly financial information for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  since none of the differences in the prior years financial statements are considered by management to be material 
however  we determined the cumulative adjustment for the above corrections to be significant to the fourth quarter results and  therefore  restated the prior quarterly and annual information included in this annual report on form k 
accordingly  readers of the financial statements should read the restated information in this annual report on form k as opposed to the previously filed information 
general this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
as of april   we operated upscale  high volume  casual dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark 
we also operated five upscale casual dining restaurants under the grand lux cafe mark in houston  texas  dallas  texas  los angeles  california  chicago  illinois and las vegas  nevada  one self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment center in orlando  florida  and a bakery production facility 
we also licensed three limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenue from our gift cards also known as stored value cards is recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  all outstanding balances on such cards are included as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors is recognized when the products are shipped 
sales and cost of sales are reported separately for restaurant and bakery activities 
all other operating cost and expense categories are reported on a combined basis for both restaurant and bakery activities 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present  in all material respects  our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
new restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales comparison in their nineteenth month of operation 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks and will end on january  our cheesecake factory restaurants offer approximately menu items including appetizers  pizza  seafood  steaks  chicken  burgers  pasta  specialty items  salads  sandwiches  omelets and desserts  including approximately varieties of cheesecake and other baked desserts 
grand lux cafe is an upscale  casual dining concept that we created and are evaluating for future expansion 
in contrast to many chain restaurant operations  substantially all of our menu items except desserts manufactured at our bakery production facility are prepared on the restaurant premises using high quality  fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes 
we believe our restaurants are recognized by consumers for offering exceptional value with generous food portions at moderate prices 
our restaurants possess a distinctive  contemporary design and decor that creates a high energy ambiance in a casual setting 
our restaurants currently range in size from  to  interior square feet  provide full liquor service and are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner  as well as sunday brunch 
total restaurant sales represented  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  national and regional economic and public safety conditions  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost and availability of raw materials  labor and energy  purchasing power  governmental regulations and local competitive factors 
accordingly  we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts over time to protect their longer term competitiveness

fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million consisted of the following components million from the openings of sixteen new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened prior to fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately to  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal a single restaurant open during the full period of fiscal would have generated operating weeks 
average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year increased to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales productivity per productive square foot of approximately for fiscal  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases 
for fiscal  the comparable restaurant sales increase slightly exceeded our effective price increase for the full fiscal year of approximately due to the lower than expected sales in fiscal due to inclement weather 
refer to management s discussion and analysis of fiscal compared to fiscal we presently update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
for cheesecake factory restaurants  these updates generally occur during january february the winter menu change and july august the summer menu change 
for our winter menu change  we implemented an approximate effective menu price increase for the purpose of offsetting those operating cost and expense increases that were known or expected as of january we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  holidays  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors referenced in this annual report on form k can impact comparable sales comparisons 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increased sales to our warehouse club customers  which accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal  as well as increased sales of the dream factory and private label products 
restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs increased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased costs for fresh poultry and certain dairy related commodities during fiscal the menu at our restaurants is one of the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  is not overly dependent on a single commodity 
changes in costs for one commodity are often  but not always  counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include fresh produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other fresh dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
we are currently able to contract for the majority of the food commodities used in our restaurant operations for periods up to one year 
many of the fresh commodities  such as fish  dairy  and certain produce and poultry products are not currently contractible for periods longer than days in most cases 
as a result  these fresh commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other general agricultural conditions 
we currently expect food costs as a percentage of restaurant revenues for fiscal to be less than fiscal based on contracts we have in place and current and expected market conditions  we expect generally flat costs for the majority of our commodities  including produce  meat  seafood and general grocery items 
we also expect slightly lower costs for our poultry and dairy commodities and higher costs for our fresh fish commodities 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected menu price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
while we have been successful in the past in reacting to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales includes ingredient  packaging and production supply costs and excludes depreciation  which is captured separately in depreciation and amortization expenses 
bakery cost of sales was million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this percentage increase was primarily due to increased costs for certain non contracted dairy commodities  such as butter and manufacturers cream 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our bakery or restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions beyond our control 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement for as much as million to million pounds during fiscal we have executed contracts for all of our cream cheese requirements for the first four months of fiscal at a fixed cost per pound that is slightly higher than the actual cost per pound in fiscal we plan to contract the remainder of our cream cheese requirements for fiscal as appropriate based on market conditions and prices 
we will also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting the leveraging of the fixed component of our labor costs with the increase in total revenues 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses and taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues during fiscal during fiscal  we also accrued a million reserve for pending legal actions 
as previously disclosed  the company and a subsidiary were named in three lawsuits and in individual wage and hour claims filed directly with the california division of labor standards enforcement alleging violations of california labor laws with respect to providing meal and rest breaks to our hourly employees 
while these actions are still pending  we have accrued million based on an estimate of the ultimate costs  expenses and fees which may be incurred in connection with these matters 
see item  legal proceedings in this annual report on form k 
this increase was partially offset by a million settlement of an insurance claim  net of related expenses  associated with the fiscal voluntary withdrawal of bakery products that were produced in the company s bakery production facility 
as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased to for fiscal including the net costs and expenses associated with the legal reserve and the insurance settlement of approximately million or or total revenues versus for fiscal  primarily due to the leveraging of the fixed component of these costs with the increase in total revenues 
for fiscal  we currently expect other operating costs and expenses as a percent of revenues to be approximately the same as fiscal after excluding the net costs and expenses associated with the legal reserve and insurance settlement 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  the restaurant field supervision organization  the bakery administrative organization and the corporate support organization 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  principally attributable to the leveraging of the fixed component of these costs with higher sales volumes 
during fiscal  we plan to continue to add resources to the corporate support  training and field supervision activities of our business  in conjunction with the planned openings of as many as new restaurants during the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to increases in property and equipment associated with new restaurant openings and the purchase of a new office building to house our corporate offices 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were in both fiscal and fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened fourteen cheesecake factory restaurants and two grand lux cafe restaurants during fiscal compared to fourteen cheesecake factory restaurants during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the restaurant preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
the preopening costs for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  costs for practice service activities  and straight line base rent during the in restaurant training period 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to open each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in construction and or obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which may also be caused by landlord delays 
our direct preopening costs for an  square foot  single story restaurant in an established company market averages approximately  there will also be other preopening costs associated with each restaurant opening  including costs for corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs will usually be higher for larger restaurants  our initial entry into new markets and for new concepts such as grand lux cafe 
we usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs for a typical restaurant opening within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of the restaurant s opening 
preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant  and the fluctuations could be significant 
we expense preopening costs as incurred 
based on our current growth objectives for fiscal and  preopening costs for each of those years will likely exceed the respective amount of preopening costs for the applicable prior year 
interest income  net  other income and income tax provision interest income  net decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to a higher level of investment of our interest bearing cash and short term investments in instruments with slightly shorter maturities than in the prior year 
this shift was primarily driven by the timing of funds needed for the purchase of our corporate support center and our new restaurant construction costs 
we generally invest our excess cash balances in us treasury and agency securities  investment grade corporate debt securities rated a or better and money market mutual funds 
in addition  we recorded interest expense of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower gains on the sales of investments and marketable securities that were liquidated from time to time to fund the company s working capital requirements throughout the year 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  we currently estimate our effective tax rate to remain at 
the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pretax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million for fiscal consisted of the following components million from the openings of fourteen new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened prior to fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately to  during fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year decreased slightly to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decline was principally due to severe weather throughout much of the country during the first six months of the year that resulted in approximately lost days of restaurant sales due to restaurant closings and reduced availability of our outdoor patio seats 
in addition  several of our newer restaurants experienced expected sales decreases to their sustainable run rate levels after their honeymoon opening period 
refer to item business new restaurant sales and investment characteristics in this annual report on form k 
comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal and our effective price increase for the full fiscal year was approximately 
comparable restaurant sales were also impacted by the severe weather during the first six months of the year 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
during the first half of fiscal  bakery sales were unusually high principally as a result of the initial inventory pipeline fills for new relationships with the largest warehouse club operator and a national retailer 
in addition  a former large account foodservice industry customer discontinued purchasing our product in the third quarter of fiscal following a voluntary product withdrawal and recall 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs increased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease of million was principally attributable to the decrease in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales remained relatively unchanged at for fiscal compared to for fiscal labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting the reverse leverage from the lower than expected restaurant and bakery sales due to weather conditions during the first three months of fiscal on the fixed portion of labor costs in both operations 
in addition  the severe winter weather in made it difficult for managers to adjust hourly labor 
labor expenses were also affected by increased costs for health insurance benefits 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased costs for natural gas and electric services to our restaurants amounting to approximately basis points of total revenues  higher costs for our insurance arrangements of approximately basis points and increased selling  distribution and promotional costs related to our outside bakery sales 
these increases were partially offset by costs incurred only in fiscal associated with the august bakery product withdrawal of approximately million or of total revenues 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  as the increase in these expenses for fiscal was less than the increase in total revenues for the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened fourteen restaurants during fiscal compared to twelve openings during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
interest income  net  other income and income tax provision interest income  net decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower yields on our interest bearing cash and short term investments that  in turn  were attributable to the decline in the general level of interest rates during fiscal in addition  we recorded interest expense of approximately million in fiscal associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher gains on the sales of investments and marketable securities in order to fund the company s working capital requirements 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our corporate finance strategy is to maintain a strong  conservative balance sheet in order to support our growth plan with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery operations  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations on a much larger scale 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan 
similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for substantially all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while most of our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum base rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants  further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures  and maintain and expand our bakery production capacity 
in the past  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the company s key liquidity measurements 
fiscal year restated restated dollar amounts in millions cash and marketable securities on hand  end of year net working capital  end of year adjusted net working capital  end of year current ratio  end of year adjusted current ratio  end of year long term debt  end of year cash provided by operations capital expenditures includes all marketable securities classified as either current assets million  million and million for fiscal year  and  respectively or noncurrent assets million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
represents deemed landlord financing liability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million as of december  this increase was principally due to cash flow from operations  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and deemed landlord financing  partially offset by additions to property and equipment and purchases of treasury stock 
in the table above  we also present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations provide investors with useful information regarding our overall liquidity position because all marketable securities are readily available to meet our liquidity requirements 
we continue to target a weighted average maturity for our marketable securities investment portfolio between one and two years 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our investments is classified as noncurrent assets  but remains available for our liquidity requirements 
we maintain a million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility  which expires on december  as of april   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
million of the credit facility has been reserved to support standby letters of credit for our self insurance programs 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus  or the applicable libor rate plus 
upon expiration of the credit facility  a maximum of million of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility automatically convert into a four year term loan  payable in equal quarterly installments at interest rates of higher than the applicable revolving credit rates 
the credit facility is not collateralized and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to observe certain restrictive covenants with respect to the conduct of our operations  with which we are currently in compliance 
our new restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum base and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example our share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased premises 
we may also disburse cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional discussion on the accounting treatment of amounts paid for structural components and the related landlord construction contributions 
in the future  we may also develop more freestanding restaurant locations using both ground leases and built to suit leases  which are common arrangements used to finance freestanding locations in the restaurant industry 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with secured financing 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
during fiscal  our cash outlays and accrued liability for capital expenditures was approximately million 
of that amount  new restaurant openings including several restaurants under development as of december  accounted for approximately million  approximately million represented maintenance and capacity addition outlays for our existing restaurants and approximately million related to bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
the remaining million was utilized to purchase a newly constructed two story building contiguous to our bakery production facility in california to accommodate our eventual need for additional support personnel and space for those personnel as we continue to grow our company 
we had previously leased the first floor of this building for our culinary  training and operations support activities 
the purchase price was funded with available cash and investments 
we will incur additional expenditures to finish out the interior of the building  as space is needed 
although we purchased the building with available cash and investments  we may consider mortgage and other refinancing alternatives in the future 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between and million  net of agreed upon up front cash landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this amount also excludes approximately million of landlord construction contributions to be paid as reductions to minimum or percentage rent over the term of the lease 
the amount reflected as additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows may vary from this estimate based on the accounting treatment of each operating lease 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
this estimate contemplates a net outlay of million for as many as new restaurants to be opened during fiscal  estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and estimated collections of up front cash landlord construction contributions 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants and million for corporate infrastructure investments  including interior build out of our corporate support and training center 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million for maintenance and enhancements to our existing bakery production facility and approximately million related to establishing a second bakery production facility 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  combined with expected cash flow provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us 
during fiscal  our board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization to  from  shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
under this authorization  we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of million through december  our share repurchase agreement does not require us to repurchase any common stock and may be discontinued at any time 
as of april   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  amounts in millions contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum base rent based on a percentage of sales ranging from to and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
amounts represent noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and estimated construction commitments  net of agreed upon up front landlord construction contributions 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the primary lease terms of the respective leases plus any exercised extensions of those lease terms  whichever is shorter 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgments by management 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that have been exercised 
the initial rent term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is also recorded to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural components of the building that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space  the lease agreement and in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  during the construction period  the amounts paid for structural components will be recorded as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions will be recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction for those leases that meet the criteria of eitf  the lease may qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
for these leases  the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress will be removed and the difference will be reclassified to prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
if the lease does not qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 the deemed landlord financing liability will be amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  employee health benefits and other insurable risks 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit its total exposure for each of these programs 
the estimated amounts receivable from our third party insurers under this coverage are recorded in other assets 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we maintain performance incentive plans under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  deferred shares  performance shares and performance units may be granted to employees  consultants and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
our policy is to grant all stock options at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
accordingly  we do not recognize compensation expense for company issued stock options in our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires compensation expense associated with stock options to be included in the financial statements beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  see recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we will update our estimates  which  in turn  could result in an adjustment to our effective tax rate 
we usually file our income tax returns many months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period restated 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expects that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and it has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage  which most recently increased in proposals are currently pending in congress to again increase the federal minimum wage 
several state and local governments have recently increased the minimum wage within their jurisdiction and others are presently considering such increases 
additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while the company has been able to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for its menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
we cannot guarantee that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income for our established restaurants have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
approximately two thirds of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating for all restaurants open as of april  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
holidays  severe winter weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal   and fiscal through april  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus or libor plus 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   we held million in available for sale marketable securities 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flows unless the securities were disposed of 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
