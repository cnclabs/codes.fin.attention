significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions trade and consumer promotion programs the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers  such as cooperative advertising programs  feature price discounts  in store display incentives and coupons 
the recognition of the costs for these programs  which are classified as a reduction of revenue  involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors 
actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangibles  are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment  while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other long lived asset impairment 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
pension and postretirement medical benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care trend rates 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required calculations to determine expense 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate is established as of the company s fiscal year end measurement date 
in establishing the discount rate  the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities  adjusted as appropriate for duration 
in addition  independent financial consultants apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans 
the expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance  considering the company s current and projected investment mix 
this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation  long term projected real returns for each asset class  and a premium for active management 
within any given fiscal period  significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets 
the value of plan assets  used in the calculation of pension expense  is determined on a calculated method that recognizes of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method 
gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 
if the net gain or loss exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

table of contents when the fair value of pension plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation  an additional minimum liability is recorded in other comprehensive income within shareowners equity 
as of july  and august   shareowners equity includes a minimum liability  net of tax  of million and million  respectively 
net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense was million in  million in  and million in the increase in was primarily due to a lower discount rate and a reduction in the expected return on assets  partially offset by the expected returns associated with a million voluntary contribution to a us plan 
significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows pension discount rate for benefit obligations expected return on plan assets postretirement discount rate for obligations initial health care trend rate ultimate health care trend rate estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost are as follows a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately million  a basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately million 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately million 
although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in and  the company made million and million contributions  respectively  to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements 
contributions to international plans were million in and million in in  there were no contributions to the us plans and contributions to international plans were million

see also note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement medical expenses 
income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates  tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions 
tax reserves are established when  despite the company s belief that tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are subject to challenge and the company may not successfully defend its position 
these reserves  as well as the related interest  are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized
