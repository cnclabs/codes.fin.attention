focus on customer service we have always focused on customer service and maximizing client retention 
fiscal year client retention is at record levels of slightly less than of our beginning client base

the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal compared with fiscal is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal and higher average portfolio balances  offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of available for sale securities 
the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal is the result of higher net realized gains on the sales of available for sale securities and higher average portfolio balances  offset by lower average interest rates earned in fiscal the higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal and fiscal were driven by organic client base growth and fiscal benefited from our acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal combined operating and sg a expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended may in millions change change change compensation related expenses facilities excluding depreciation expenses depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets other expenses expense charge to increase legal reserve total operating and sg a expenses combined operating and selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal  excluding the expense charge to increase legal reserve

our acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal contributed to the increases in expenses in fiscal at may   we had approximately  employees compared with approximately  at may   and  at may  
table of contents depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings  furniture and fixtures  data processing equipment  and software 
in addition to the impact from the acquisitions of businesses  depreciation expense in fiscal was higher due in part to the purchase of a  square foot facility in rochester  new york  and the placement into service of our million consolidated data center  both of which occurred during the first half of fiscal amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from our fiscal acquisitions

investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients  which is included in total revenues

the decrease in investment income in fiscal compared with fiscal is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances  lower average interest rates earned  and lower net realized gains on the sales of available for sale investments

commitments and contractual obligations we have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted  secured  short term lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows financial institution amount available expiration date jp morgan chase bank  na million february fleet national bank  a bank of america company million february pnc bank  national association million february wells fargo bank  national association million february our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex and each of the financial institutions the lenders  pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 

table of contents the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary

the obligations shown as other liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at may   with million in other current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to million are excluded because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 
advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices  which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions  while paychex and advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and tax filing services 
in addition  advantage has a relationship with nebs whereby advantage performs all client functions other than sales and marketing

table of contents critical accounting policies note a to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex  inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenues are largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenues  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred for peo worksite employees were  million   million  and  million for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenues from certain time and attendance solutions are recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery is complete for the software and hardware  the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax filing and payment services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt  with some items extending to ninety days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the consolidated statements of income because the collection  holding  and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we utilize an independent actuary 
we do not discount our reserves for workers compensation insurance claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including social and economic trends  changes in legal liability law and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

table of contents we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
in fiscal  workers compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided under a pre funded  deductible workers compensation policy with a national insurance company 
in fiscal  the policy was no longer pre funded and claims were paid as incurred 
our maximum individual claims liability was  under each of the fiscal and policies 
we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers compensation claims as of may prepaid current long term in thousands expense liability liability valuation of investments our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
however  changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security s cost basis 
on our consolidated statements of income  realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients  whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income  net 
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities 
we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 
goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations  we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets such as customer lists  certain license agreements  trade names  and non compete agreements 
the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
for certain fixed assets  including software  and intangible assets  we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants 
the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
we have million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at may   resulting from acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
based on the results of our goodwill impairment review  no impairment charge was recognized in fiscal or fiscal subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

table of contents we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients inability to meet their payroll obligations 
as part of providing payroll  tax filing and payment services  and employee payment services  we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits 
electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers 
we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 
contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded million and million  respectively  in expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters 
at may   approximately million of our reserve for pending legal matters remains 
based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we deem this amount adequate 
the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment 
this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter 
in light of the legal reserve recorded  we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 
for additional information regarding pending legal matters refer to note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we account for the tax benefit from the exercise of non qualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paid in capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale debt securities  and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale debt securities 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer term available for sale investments 
we generally direct investments towards high credit quality  fixed rate municipal and government securities and manage the available for sale portfolio to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates 
the federal funds rate has increased to as of may  in the fiscal year ended may   the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was compared with for the same period last year 
short term interest rates rose steadily throughout fiscal  but longer term rates  on average  were basically unchanged from the end of fiscal while short term and long term interest rates generally move in the same direction  there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship 
when interest rates begin to rise  the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and short term interest rate changes as discussed below 
the federal funds rate decreased from at the end of fiscal to at may  the decreasing interest rate environment experienced 
table of contents through fiscal negatively affected net income growth 
during most of fiscal and  the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longer term available for sale portfolio 
during fiscal and fiscal  we mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sales of our investments 
increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short term investments  which totaled approximately billion at may   and over time will increase earnings from our longer term available for sale investments  which totaled approximately billion at may  earnings from the available for sale investments  which currently have an average duration of years  excluding the impact of auction rate securities tied to short term interest rates  will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 
an increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the cost and fair value of available for sale securities at may   by contractual maturity are shown below 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in thousands cost fair value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total available for sale securities the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate increase decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year on june   the federal funds rate was increased to 
calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale investments  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous 
subject to these factors  a basis point change generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
the total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments is expected to average approximately billion in fiscal our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities with an average duration of thirty days and invested in available for sale municipal securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
we estimate that the earnings effect of a basis point change in interest rates basis points for tax exempt investments at the beginning of fiscal would be in the range of million to million for fiscal 
table of contents the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized loss of million at may   compared with a net unrealized loss of million at may   and a net unrealized gain of million at may  during fiscal  the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of million to a net unrealized gain of million 
during fiscal  the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately million net unrealized loss to million net unrealized gain 
the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately million at july  see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  for additional disclosures about our investment portfolios 
as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value  with weighted average yields to maturity of and  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of securities at may   would be in the range of million to million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value 
this hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds 
we attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aa rated securities and a rated short term securities  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument 
at may   all available for sale and short term securities classified as cash equivalents held an a or equivalent rating  with over of available for sale securities holding an aa rating or better
