legal matters on march   rochester medical corporation  inc  filed a complaint against the company  another manufacturer and two group purchasing organizations under the caption rochester medical corporation  inc v 
c 
r 
bard  inc  et al 
civil action no 
cv  united states district court  eastern district of texas 
the plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain the company s market share by engaging in a variety of conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws 
the plaintiff also has asserted claims for business disparagement  common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships 
the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages in an unspecified amount 
the company intends to defend this matter vigorously 
because the litigation is in a preliminary stage  the company cannot assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate  or a range of estimates  of potential damages 
the company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in a future period or the company s financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement r  share based payment  statement r to be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june   thereby becoming effective for bard in the third quarter of statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as an operating expense in the income statement 
the cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on grant dates 
the new standard may be adopted using either the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective method 
the company is currently evaluating its share based employee compensation programs  the potential impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and the alternative adoption methods 
management s use of non gaap measures net sales on a constant currency basis and ongoing net sales are non gaap financial measures 
the company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales  the company believes that evaluating growth in net ii sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales 
constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior year s local currency sales by the current period s exchange rate 
constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows 
during  the company disposed of certain assets  the net sales of which are reported in the oncology products group 
the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales of the products from assets which were not sold  or ongoing net sales  provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales of the product group 
the limitation of these non gaap measures is that they may exclude items that impact actual gaap results 
all non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for gaap results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec recently issued guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue  net of discounts and rebates  when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured 
unless agreed otherwise  the company s terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss passes fob origin 
certain sales to domestic and european distributors are fob destination 
for arrangements where the company s terms state fob destination  the company records sales on this basis 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out lifo method 
for all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out fifo method 
due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the lifo method and the fifo method is not significant 
legal reserve estimates the company is at times involved in legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
a liability is recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
tax estimates the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside the united states 
the company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company s us federal tax filings have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years ending prior to all differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled 
the company is currently under examination by the irs for the through calendar years 
the company s uk affiliates tax filings have been examined by inland revenue in the united kingdom for tax years ending prior to all differences arising from these audits have been resolved and settled 
the company s uk ii affiliates tax filings are currently under examination by inland revenue in the united kingdom for the through tax years 
management believes that the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  the allocation and or recognition of income on intercompany transactions  the timing and amount of deductions and the tax treatment related to acquisitions and divestitures 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a reporting period 
allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable  amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts 
in estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and other market related conditions 
the company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change 
valuation of ipr d  goodwill and intangible assets when the company acquires another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between ipr d  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
ipr d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for ipr d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including ipr d  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the company s estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
intangible assets consist primarily of patents  other intellectual property and distribution rights  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
ii pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  forecast  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these include statements relating to product approvals  future performance of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results 
in addition  there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business 
the company s business involves the design  development  manufacture  packaging  distribution and sale of life sustaining medical devices 
these devices are often utilized on  or permanently or temporarily implanted in  seriously ill patients in clinically demanding circumstances  such as operating rooms  emergency units  intensive care and critical care settings  among others 
these circumstances among other factors  can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events  including patient mortality and injury  and could lead to product liability claims and other litigation  product withdrawals  recalls  field actions or other regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties  the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied 
it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties  but the most significant factors  in addition to those addressed above  that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include  but are not limited to effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business  including the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies  including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs as a result of the company s restructuring  or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses  the ability to complete planned clinical trials successfully  to develop and obtain approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates  the ability to identify appropriate companies  businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates  to consummate and integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements with favorable terms  the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by cost containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies  the ability to maintain or increase research and development expenditures  the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales  ii the ability to maintain our effective tax rate and uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation  the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms  the risk that the company may not successfully implement its new erp information system  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations in future periods or its ability to meet the ongoing requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  internal factors  such as retention of key employees  including sales employees  and changes in business strategies  the effects of negative publicity concerning our products  which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products and which could result in decreased product demand or product withdrawal  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts  which are generated based  among other things  on projected volumes and sales of many product types  some of which are more profitable than others  damage to a company facility  which could render the company unable to manufacture a particular product as the company may utilize only one manufacturing facility for certain of its major products and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets and the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically  or our business more broadly  so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets 
competitive factors  including the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers  resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant  complex and long term contracts than in the past  both in the united states and abroad  development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development  technological advances  patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the company s products and attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs 
difficulties and delays inherent in the development  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical products  including lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes  which may result in lost market opportunities  delays or denials of  or grants of low levels of reimbursement for  procedures using newly developed products  the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture  market or distribute existing products  the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements  such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling  performance  efficacy or safety concerns for existing products  whether scientifically justified or not  that may lead to product recalls  withdrawals  litigation or declining sales  including adverse events relating to the company s vena cava filters  the failure to obtain  limitations on the use of or the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights  and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs  ii difficulties obtaining necessary components used in the company s products and or price increases from the company s suppliers of critical components and customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products  which can result in the company s exclusion from large hospital systems  integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organization contracts 
governmental action  including impact of continued health care cost containment  new laws and judicial decisions related to health care availability  payment for health care products and services or the marketing and distribution of products  including legislative or administrative reforms to the united states medicare and medicaid systems or other united states or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements for procedures that use the company s products  changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity  the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the industry in general or the company in particular  changes in the tax or environmental laws affecting our business and compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with regulations regarding air emissions  waste water discharges and solid waste 
legal disputes  including disputes over intellectual property rights  product liability claims  claims asserting securities law violations  claims asserting violations of federal law in connection with medicare and or medicaid reimbursement  derivative shareholder actions  claims asserting antitrust violations and environmental matters  including the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in the company s manufacturing  sterilization and research activities and the potential for the company to be held liable for any resulting damages

other factors beyond our control  including catastrophes  both natural and man made  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions  acts of terrorism or war 
ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
the company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the mexican peso and the japanese yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
bard s risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at december  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million  and if the us dollar uniformly weakened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
in december  the company issued million of notes due these notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on december   at a redemption price equal to the principal amount 
assuming these notes are held to maturity  the market value of the notes approximates million at december  assuming a basis point increase or decrease in us interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity  the market value of the notes would approximate million and million  respectively  on december  ii management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
with respect to the scope of this report  in accordance with fin  the company consolidated financial information related to genyx medical  inc  a variable interest entity  in while the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the variable interest entity  management has been unable to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at that entity since the company does not have the ability to dictate or modify the controls of genyx medical  inc and does not have the ability  in practice  to assess those controls 
as a result  the company s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december  does not include an assessment of the internal controls of genyx medical  inc  which is associated with total assets of million  liabilities of million and research and development expenses of million included in the consolidated financial statements of the company as of december  based on our assessment and those criteria  subject to the foregoing  management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  the company s registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
that report appears on page ii ii
