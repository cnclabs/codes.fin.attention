item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment analysis 
same store includes storage centers and business parks that were acquired prior to january of the prior year and developed properties that have been operating for at least two full years as of january of the current year 
new store represents those storage centers recently acquired or developed for which performance is measured primarily based on original investment expectations 
we evaluate all storage centers on the same basis regardless of ownership interest in the property 
we believe noi is a meaningful disclosure of operating performance as a supplement to net income because we rely on noi for purposes of making decisions with respect to resource allocations  current property values  segment performance  and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results 
noi is defined as storage center operations revenues less direct operating and real estate tax expense for each of our properties 
for a reconciliation of same store and new store noi to net income see note to our consolidated financial statements

three storage centers are operated through a leasing arrangement with a california developer for which the storage center assets are consolidated in our financial statements but not the store operations 
we receive property management fees for operating these storage centers 
the actual completed cost of these projects are reported in us dollars translated at the december  exchange rate of to the euro 
operating results are reported at the average exchange rate for the year ended december  which was to the euro 
as these exchange rates are different we believe it does not allow for an accurate measure of property investment yield 
however  we believe the application of a constant exchange rate to both the property cost and operating results may provide a more meaningful measure of investment yield 
wholly owned or leased the majority of our storage centers are owned directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries 
additionally  as of december   we operated properties in the us and including capital leases in europe that are subject to land or building leases requiring non contingent rent payments 

table of contents consolidated joint ventures we develop and operate properties in the united states and in europe with various partners through joint ventures in which we have ownership interests ranging from to 
we operate properties through tennessee joint ventures and properties through florida joint ventures  in which our ownership ranges from to 
through december   those joint ventures were managed by two separate groups with whom we established affiliation relationships to develop and manage jointly owned storage centers 
as of january   we took over the property management of the florida properties directly 
under the joint venture agreements  all major decisions require unanimous consent of both parties 
however  we have the ability to exercise unilateral control without incurring significant costs and therefore we consider that we have effective control over those joint ventures 
we operate properties in north carolina and south carolina through various joint ventures with morningstar storage centers  llc morningstar 
we have entered into an agreement with morningstar members to form one or more joint ventures to develop and operate additional self storage properties

we pay morningstar property management  llc a property management fee equal to the greater of  per property per month or of the gross revenues of each property per month 
we operate eight storage centers owned through a joint venture with a california developer 
under our agreement with this developer  the california developer purchases sites in southern california and constructs storage centers on them according to our specifications 
on completion of the rent up period  the storage centers may be purchased by a joint venture that is consolidated in our financial statements 
prior to such purchase  we have no ownership interest in the properties and accordingly  they are not included in any discussions of our operating results 
in and we entered into loan agreements with this developer collateralized by three properties under construction 
as of december   the developer had drawn million under these loan agreements  which amount is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet  and million remained available to finance the construction of the properties 
we also have three properties under leasing arrangements with this developer

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we own  operate and develop self storage properties in principal cities in the united states and in western europe 
headquartered in seattle  washington in the u 
s and brussels  belgium in europe  we operate as a reit 
since our founding in  we and our predecessor company have steadily grown our business of investing in and operating self storage facilities 
we own or lease  directly and through our subsidiaries and joint ventures  properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet and manage properties containing approximately million rentable square feet for third parties 
today we are estimated to be one of the largest self storage property owners in the united states with a network of storage centers located in different states 
we are the largest self storage owner in europe with storage centers located in seven countries 
we directly own most of these properties but also hold indirect interests through our subsidiaries and joint ventures 
our approach to investment in self storage our objective is to maximize shareholder value through continued improvement in the performance of our existing portfolio and through acquisition and development and investment in additional self storage properties 
historically  we have been long term holders of storage properties that we acquire or develop because we believe these assets have steady long term growth characteristics  low functional obsolescence and cost benefits relating to economies of scale 
however  we will  from time to time  sell properties when we feel market conditions warrant or where a property fails to fit into our strategic plans 
we take a long term view of planning and executing this objective 
we have observed that changes in people s lives or circumstances are the key driver of demand for short term storage space 
private individuals represent approximately of our customer base 
business customers looking for expansion or transition storage space make up the balance  although this ratio may vary from storage center to storage center 
our customer base spans a wide range of economic strata and business types 
based on our experience in the business  we have determined that most customers place a high value on convenience through the location of the center and ease of renting  access and moving 
consequently  we have elected to focus our investment activities in densely populated  high quality neighborhoods and offer high quality products and services 
we believe a growing segment of prospective customers are willing to pay higher rates for these benefits 
when we enter a new market  we seek highly visible  easily accessible locations in retail corridors to create customer awareness 
through multiple locations of this kind in a metropolitan area  we seek to establish brand recognition as well as economies of scale in operating our storage centers 
in most markets  our goal is to own at least storage centers in order to realize these efficiencies 
to further enhance brand recognition  we strive to achieve a uniform look to our properties through the use of signage  color schemes  quality of the buildings and our trademark lighthouse office design in new developments 
our approach to managing the business we believe that the supply and demand characteristics of the self storage industry are defined by neighborhood trade areas that can range in size from one to five miles in radius 
to manage the business effectively at any given location  we must be aware of the local dynamics of demand  pricing and competition within the applicable neighborhood trade area 
as a result  we approach the management of our business and portfolio on a decentralized basis by maintaining local management and marketing expertise in all our key markets 
our field personnel constantly monitor market trends in demand  competition  pricing and internal performance  making strategic and tactical 
table of contents adjustments at the storage centers as needed 
key metrics in monitoring the supply of self storage properties include construction starts  sales of doors by suppliers to the industry and inquiry levels at the storage centers 
we monitor competition and pricing by watching our closing rate on inquiries and our volume of discounting for new customers 
centrally  we maintain an in house asset management team that evaluates all investment proposals and monitors progress and performance of each property 
we take a similar approach to the business in europe where we have integrated a centralized european investment team and decentralized management teams made up almost entirely of local personnel in each of the countries where we invest 
current industry trends and outlook supply and demand after experiencing a general softening in demand at our us self storage centers in and  we noticed an increase in inquiries in the fourth quarter of that remained steady through march however  certain of our new storage centers  particularly in europe  are taking a longer period of time  to reach rental stabilization  which we typically consider to be occupancy 
in the last several years  new storage centers have been taking to months to reach stabilization 
in order to counteract this slow down in the rent up pace  we have offered reduced rates to attract new customers 
we believe there were two main factors contributing to the trends during and the slowdown in the us economy  and the volume of new supply entering our markets 
we believe some local economies have been more affected by downturns  such as northern california  a market that continued to be slow in in other markets  such as sweden  the netherlands  chicago and parts of texas  we have seen a significant amount of new supply over the past three years  contributing to weaker operating results 
in our view  the sustained rate at which new supply came in to the markets during and was unusual 
we attribute the continued development  in the face of declining industry fundamentals  to the historically low interest rates available to developers 
reported new construction starts have only noticeably started to decline over the past months 
beginning in  in response to the reduced demand and increased competition  we became more aggressive with our sales training programs and increased our storage center operating hours 
additionally in and we intensified our storage center maintenance program and we expect in to increase capital expenditures to improve our existing storage centers 
we believe these efforts began to show results in the third quarter of and throughout although customer inquiries have been fairly stable in compared to  we experienced an increase in our closing rates and we have been able to increase average occupancy and rental rates in most areas 
customer inquiries have remained steady in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  but average annual rental rates per square foot in our same store portfolio of in the fourth quarter grew by and occupancy by 
this growth in rental rates and occupancy resulted in same store operations revenue growth and noi growth in of and  respectively  over the same period of see segment analysis for details 
as we expand in europe to reach targeted economies of scale in various markets  our newly developed storage centers have had an impact on our existing european storage centers  as evidenced by lower than expected occupancy 
we believe this impact is temporary 
consumer awareness of the self storage product is dramatically different in europe than in the united states 
in the united states  where self storage has existed for over years  the product is well known and accepted by the us consumer 
the european market penetration is only of the current us level based on the ratio of number of self storage properties to the population 

table of contents today  there are a reported  self storage facilities in the united states 
in europe  however  self storage is still relatively new and general consumer awareness is lower 
there are reported to be approximately self storage properties in the european countries where we operate 
as consumer awareness and acceptance grows in europe  we believe that these effects of expansion will begin to decline 
acquisition and development of real estate historically  we have grown in the united states both through development and acquisition  taking advantage of current market conditions to select either alternative 
in europe  most of our growth has been through development of new storage centers 
we have made limited dispositions of properties 
we believe that low interest rates in the united states have contributed to a rise in the price being paid by private and public investors to acquire existing self storage facilities in the united states 
in this environment  we have focused on acquisitions that we consider unique or strategic in nature 
the current environment has also created opportunities to sell some of the assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our long term strategic goals and we will continue to consider these opportunities 
our development of new storage centers in the united states has slowed in recent years as quality opportunities have become more limited 
in general  we view the us market as mature  with a strong supply of self storage properties 
although current trends have been more encouraging  we believe future development growth opportunities will result from population growth in new markets and depends on the rent up of our properties  the economic growth of each region and competition 
we have placed renewed emphasis on performance and opportunities for improvement within our existing portfolio  particularly through redevelopment of our older storage centers 
increases in steel  cement and other construction costs may further affect our ability to continue to develop or improve our existing properties cost effectively 
in europe  where we have a significant market leadership position in an emerging industry  we continue to develop new storage centers due to the availability of quality real estate at attractive prices 
from time to time we consider expanding into additional european markets when we feel conditions are appropriate 
we believe continued growth in europe will help solidify our position as market leader and improve our economies of scale in marketing and management 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
significant estimates include the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated lives of depreciable assets  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the allocation of purchase prices of acquired properties 
actual results may differ from these and other estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we consolidate all wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  a revision to fin under fin r  a variable interest entity vie must be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
we assess 
table of contents whether partially owned subsidiaries are vies and we consolidated all vies of which we are the primary beneficiary 
partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that are not vies are consolidated when we control the entity  which could result from i the ability to elect a majority of the management committee  board of partners or similar authority  ii our being named as the managing investor of the entity  or iii our providing substantially all of the equity 
in assessing the consolidation treatment of partially owned entities  we also consider the nature of veto rights  if any  held by minority investors 
to the extent that a minority investor has substantive veto rights over major decisions  the entity will generally not be consolidated 
entities not consolidated are generally accounted for under the equity method  as we typically have significant influence over unconsolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings or losses based on our ownership interest and the profit allocation provisions of the entity 
see further discussion below on the adoption of fin revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue from the majority of our customers at the contracted rate for each month occupied because they are under month to month lease agreements 
revenue related to customers who sign longer period leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
storage centers storage centers are recorded at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered  in which case  the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value 
in a business combination we also assess the value of in place lease intangibles which are amortized to expense over the expected life of the leases 
using our best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  we review storage centers for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our assets might not be recoverable 
fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions 
if impairment analysis assumptions change  then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
to determine if there is impairment we compare the carrying value of goodwill and our storage centers assets to the estimated fair market value of our same store portfolio storage centers 
we use common industry methods to assess the value of our portfolio and we estimate future cash flows based on the storage centers noi and current market capitalization rates 
derivatives gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income  and subsequently recognized in the statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings  depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in earnings 
we evaluate the effectiveness of designated hedges at inception and on a quarterly basis 
our main objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense  to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce our various foreign currency risks 
to accomplish these objectives  we use interest rate swaps and caps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy and we use the sale of forward contracts and the purchase of call options to reduce our foreign currency risks 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments may materially affect net income 
dispositions and financing arrangements we account for sales of certain storage centers in which we have continuing involvement as financing arrangements 
we use the effective interest method based on estimated future cash flows in determining the amortization of participation rights 
this estimate is evaluated each period and is sensitive to both amount and timing of cash flows  and projected purchase price 
estimated amount and timing of distributions is based on projected property operating cash flows 
estimated amount and timing of 
table of contents purchase price is based on projected stabilized noi and our estimate of when each property will reach stabilization 
we periodically re evaluate our estimate of the option price  the projected timing of our joint venture partner s exercise of their put option and the related expected cash flows 
changes are accounted for as a change in estimate  affecting gross participation rights and subsequent amortization of participation rights 
real estate investment trust as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes if minimum distribution  income  asset and shareholder tests are met 
however  not all of our underlying entities are qualified reit subsidiaries and may be subject to federal and state taxes  when applicable 
in addition  foreign entities may also be subject to taxes of the host country 
an income tax provision is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable reit subsidiaries and foreign entities 
a deferred tax component has arisen based upon the differences in gaap versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition 
deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets resulting primarily from cumulative net operating losses arising in certain domestic taxable subsidiaries and in our european subsidiaries 
we regularly evaluate both the positive and negative evidence that we believe is relevant in assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realized 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the tax asset either in part or in whole  a valuation allowance is provided 
one significant factor representing negative evidence in the evaluation of whether deferred tax assets arising from cumulative net operating losses will be realized is historical taxable income or loss of the entity 
in cases where a taxable entity has not demonstrated a history of achieving taxable income  this represents significant negative evidence in assessing whether the amounts will be realized and generally requires that we provide a valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement eliminates the alternative to use apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting and generally requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r when it becomes effective in the third quarter under sfas r we will recognize stock based compensation expenses related to our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan which were previously only disclosed 
although we are still evaluating under which transition method we will adopt sfas r and are still assessing the impact on our financial position and operating results  we believe that the disclosures required under sfas approximate our results if we had adopted the provisions of sfas r as of december  
table of contents results of operations our consolidated statements of net income for periods prior to  we did not consolidate shurgard europe or first shurgard in our financial statements 
instead  we accounted for our investments in these entities under the equity method of accounting due to the substantive and important approval rights over significant operating decisions retained by our partners in these entities 
beginning in  we consolidated these entities in accordance with fin r 
because consolidation results in the inclusion of shurgard europe s and first shurgard s revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and the equity method did not  the financial statements for and are not directly comparable to the financial statements in the following table summarizes the main components of the changes in net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  change in net income diluted earnings per share in thousands except per share data impact of gain on sale of properties from discontinued operations increase in domestic operating income before general  administrative and other decrease in impairment losses decrease in amortization income related to participation rights discount increase in ownership of shurgard europe net of minority interest additional depreciation on basis difference of shurgard europe s assets cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in increase in domestic general  administrative other than stg exit costs and stock compensation expense increase in stock compensation expense exit costs of containerized storage operations stg increase in interest on loans increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain on intercompany debt domestic gains and losses on derivatives other  net including the effect of additional shares outstanding increase in net income the diluted earnings per share impact is calculated using the weighted average shares for the year ended december  net income net income was million in compared to net income of million in and million in the increase in net income from to is primarily due to a gain on the sale of properties  lower impairment losses and an increase in our domestic storage centers operating results which were partially offset by higher losses and higher financing costs related to our increased ownership in shurgard 
table of contents europe  and higher general  administrative and other expense as further discussed below 
the decline in net income from to is the result of impairment of long lived assets recognized in and of higher general  administrative and other expense

domestic storage center operations revenue increased million  or  compared to as a result of an increase in the number of storage centers  higher occupancy and increases in rates 
storage centers operations revenue of million in increased million  or  from as a result of the increasing portfolio of stores in particular from stores acquired in other revenue other revenue of million in decreased million or compared to our containerized storage business  which had revenue of million in  ceased operations in the first quarter of and therefore had nominal revenue in this loss of revenue was partially offset in by a growth in revenue from our tenant referral insurance program which generated million in compared to million in other revenue of million in increased from million in due primarily to the increased revenue from our tenant insurance referral program that started in  which was  in operating expenses operating expenses of million increased million  or compared to  of which million relate to our consolidation of shurgard europe in domestic operating expenses increased million or compared to as a result of an increase in the number of storage centers and an increase in personnel expenses 
see discussion of these expenses under segment analysis 
expenses associated with our containerized storage business  which ceased active operations in the first quarter of  were million in  million in and nominal in in addition to the expenses identified under segment analysis  operating expenses include internal acquisition costs and development expenses related to abandoned development efforts of million in compared to million in and million in this is primarily due to abandoned development projects in europe where we scaled down our developments in certain countries and in the abandonment of an acquisition project 
also in we incurred approximately million of costs on two operating related litigation matters  including million in settlement costs that we recognized in december when we reached a proposed settlement 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion of these matters 
operating expenses of million in increased by million or compared to this was primarily a result of increased expenses attributable to new stores 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of million in increased million or compared to consolidation of shurgard europe and the growth of our european operations accounted for million of the increase  including an increase of million related to the excess of the purchase price we paid for our additional ownership interests in shurgard europe over its book value in  an amount that we allocated to buildings in which shurgard europe had ownership interests 
depreciation and amortization of domestic facilities increased million or to the prior year due to the increase in the number of storage centers and in particular due to the fact that we had a full year of depreciation on stores acquired mid year in depreciation and amortization of million in increased million or compared to primarily due to the increase in number of stores 
impairment losses in we recognized  of impairment losses because we adjusted the value of one piece of excess land that we intend to sell 
in the million of impairment losses included million of impairment losses related to certain real estate assets  of which million relates to four properties associated with our joint venture ccp shurgard see note to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally in we recognized a million impairment expense related to our decision to exit the containerized storage business and a million write down of a note receivable 
in  impairment losses of million related to one real estate property 

table of contents general  administrative and other expenses general and administrative expenses of million in increased million or compared to our consolidation of shurgard europe accounted for million of the increase 
of the remaining million  million is due to exit costs incurred in connection with the closing of our containerized storage business  and the remainder consists primarily of increased professional fees incurred in connection with accounting  and financial reporting  as well as compensation expenses resulting from newly created management positions 
consultant fees associated with efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of were approximately million and compensation expenses increased by approximately million 
the increase in compensation expenses was attributable primarily to higher stock based compensation resulting from our increased use of restricted stock instead of stock options to compensate our executives 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in audit fees 
our audit fees were higher because after our former auditors resigned in november  our new independent registered public accountants were required to re audit and in addition to auditing the increase in stock based compensation expense accounts for million of the increase in compensation expense and results from our increased use of restricted stock grants instead of stock option grants to compensate our executives 
general and administrative expenses were million for  an increase of million  or compared to this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in accounting and professional fees and a million increase in compensation expense related to newly created positions 
interest on loans interest expense of million increased million compared to million in  an increase of 
the consolidation of shurgard europe and the debt financing of new developments in europe in account for million of the increase 
the interest expense incurred in the united states increased by million in due to the higher aggregate indebtedness incurred during to finance the purchase of additional ownership interest in shurgard europe and to finance the acquisition and development of additional properties in and interest expenses in totaled million compared to million in the increase in relates primarily to increased mortgage notes payable assumed as part of the purchase of our interest in morningstar in june and the issuance of million senior notes payable in march amortization of participation rights discount we recognized amortization income of million in compared to amortization income of million in and amortization expense of million in the adjustments to amortization are based on re evaluations of our estimated participation rights liability each period based on the performance of the related properties and estimates of rights retirement dates 
on june  we entered into an agreement to retire the remaining participation rights

loss on derivatives the gain or loss on financial derivatives is the gain or loss recognized for the changes in the fair market value of those financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
we had an unrealized loss of  million and million in  and respectively 
the loss in is primarily the net effect of the change in value of certain domestic interest rate swaps and certain currency forward contracts on the euro that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the losses in and related to the changes in values of domestic interest rate swaps we entered into in to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations related to our various options on the financing of a development transaction 
these swaps matured and were paid off in february foreign exchange gain loss the foreign exchange gain of million in relates primarily to bonds with shurgard europe and a wholly owned european subsidiary that are marked to the period end exchange rate 
we had limited foreign operations in and in interest income and other  net interest income and other in was million compared to a million in and million in  respectively 
interest income is comprised primarily of interest income on notes receivable and of other gain 
in we recognized a million one time lease termination 

table of contents minority interest as a result of our consolidation of shurgard europe and its subsidiaries beginning january  we recorded a minority interest benefit of million in approximately  million of this minority interest benefit in relates to first shurgard and second shurgard  respectively  in which shurgard europe holds a ownership interest and million relates to our partner s interest in shurgard europe 
for the years ended  and minority interest expenses related to our domestic joint ventures totaled million  million and  respectively 
equity in earnings losses of other real estate investments in  we had an interest in one entity that we accounted for under the equity method 
in and  we accounted for our interest in shurgard europe under the equity method of accounting and recorded losses of million and million  respectively for this investment 
in  we consolidated shurgard europe and therefore had no related comparable charge 
income tax expense shurgard europe is subject to income taxation in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and  as a result of losses it has incurred since its inception  has generated deferred tax assets 
our domestic non reit activities principally our containerized storage business also incurred losses and generated tax deferred assets 
because we have been unable to demonstrate recoverability of such assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting these deferred tax assets for each reporting period 
as a result  no material income tax expense or benefit is recorded in our consolidated statements of net income 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle upon adoption of fin r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of million due to the consolidation of first shurgard 
this is the result of eliminating all intercompany profits from inception of first shurgard in as required under fin r 
before  prior to adoption of fin r  we eliminated our ownership share of intercompany profits 
discontinued operations in  we reclassified the operating income of six storage centers that we sold in and two additional storage centers that we sold in january and february we recognized a million gain on the sale of the six storage centers in there were no comparable transactions in or european consolidated statement of income see separate note of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k shurgard europe began consolidating first shurgard as of january  and has grown its storage center portfolio significantly since consequently  shurgard europe s results of operations are not directly comparable to its results for the same periods in and this analysis is included to explain operating and other trends occurring in shurgard europe 
shurgard europe s statements of operations were converted from euros to us dollars at an average exchange rate of to the euro for the year ended december   to the euro for the year ended december  and to the euro for the year ended december  accordingly  some portions of the changes discussed below are also attributable to the different exchange rates used in the currency translations 
revenues and total expenses increased million and million  respectively  from to at each period s average exchange rate 
at constant exchange rates  using the average rate  the respective increases in revenues and expenses from to would be million and million 
storage centers operations revenue storage centers operations revenue of million in increased by million or  from million in and from million in at constant exchange rates storage centers operations revenues increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are the results of the increasing number of storage centers in europe and the rent up of existing stores  as well as the consolidation of first shurgard as of january  the performance of the storage centers is discussed more fully under european segment analysis 

table of contents other revenue other revenue of million in consisted primarily of development and management fee revenue paid by first shurgard 
fees from joint ventures are eliminated in the consolidation in shurgard europe recognized million in of development and management fees from shurgard uk west london ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of shurgard which owns a storage center that is operated by shurgard europe 
such fees are eliminated upon consolidation with shurgard 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to million in from million in and million in at constant exchange rates the operating expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase results from higher storage center direct and indirect operating expense due to the growth of shurgard europe s storage center portfolio 
this increase was partially offset by the elimination of real estate development costs related to first shurgard under fin r in such costs amounted to million in and were not eliminated 
real estate operating expenses are affected by the adoption of fin r as in  the expenses relating to the development of first shurgard sites were recognized in the statements of operations 
the increase in costs results as well from abandoned acquisition and development projects in in france and the united kingdom 
real estate taxes real estate taxes increased to million in from million in and million in at constant exchange rates  the operating expenses in would have been million and million in the increase results from the growth of the storage center portfolio  the consolidation of first shurgard in  as opposed to  and to one time tax credits received in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in and million in at constant exchange rates the depreciation and amortization remained stable at million in compared to million in the stability in is due to the reduction of depreciation expense in certain countries to align to shurgard s accounting policy upon consolidation  which reduction offsets the increase in depreciation resulting from new operating storage centers 
general  administrative and other expenses general  administrative and other expenses increased to million in from million in and million in at constant exchange rates the general administrative and other expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of higher legal fees  consultancy fees and increased personnel costs which were incurred in the second half of resulting from the strengthening of shurgard europe s accounting function and changes made in the organization 
loss on derivatives the loss on derivatives in is primarily the result of a million loss in the market value of a three year amortizing cap to secure the interest charge for the period through on the million bonds issued by shurgard europe 
this cap does not qualify for hedge accounting  however  on consolidation with shurgard  this loss is offset by a gain on a reverse sold cap 
within shurgard europe  the loss is partially offset by a gain of  due to the marking to market of a series of currency options maturing may  whereby first shurgard has the right to purchase million for million 
minority interest the minority interest of million relates to shurgard europe s ownership interests in first shurgard and second shurgard 
first shurgard was consolidated with shurgard europe in  but was not in interest income and other interest income and other decreased to  in from million in primarily due to interest recognized on properties prior to their transfer to first shurgard 
interest expense interest expense of million in increased from million in and million in interest and other charges consist primarily of interest on the senior credit facilities of shurgard europe  first shurgard and second shurgard and the million senior notes that shurgard europe issued in october interest and other charges of million in increased from million in of this increase  million is attributable to exchange rate variance 
the remaining increase resulted primarily from 
table of contents increased borrowings under first shurgard s senior credit facility  which was used to fund its development activities as well as an increase in amortization of financing costs related to both the first shurgard and second shurgard credit facilities 
also  the senior notes issued in the fourth quarter as fixed under swap agreements bear higher interest rates than shurgard europe s credit facility and resulted in higher interest rate expense and amortization of financing costs in the second half of these increases in interest and other charges were offset by a million decrease in interest expenses on a subordinated loan from recom co  snc recom as a result of the repayment of that loan in september the increase in interest expense from to is primarily due to increased draws on shurgard europe s line of credit and additional bonds issued to shurgard to finance developments of new storage centers 
unrealized foreign exchange gain loss the unrealized foreign exchange gain of million  million and million in  and  respectively  relate primarily to the million bonds and related balances outstanding with shurgard 
because these bonds are denominated in us dollars and shurgard europe conducts business in euros  variations in exchange rates result in unrealized gains or losses 
the increase in compared to results from the increase in the loan balance in and exchange rate fluctuations 
income taxes shurgard europe is subject to income taxes in several of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
it has paid no significant income taxes because it has incurred losses since its inception  but it has generated deferred tax assets 
because shurgard europe has been unable to demonstrate recoverability of such assets  it has recorded a valuation allowance offsetting these deferred tax assets 
as of december   shurgard europe had deferred tax assets and offsetting valuation allowances of million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle upon adoption of fin r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of million due to the consolidation of first shurgard in and the resulting elimination of all intercompany profits since the inception of first shurgard in 
table of contents segment analysis we have historically evaluated performance of our real estate assets in two segments domestic same store and new store 
following the consolidation of shurgard europe beginning january   we added two new reportable segments  european same store and european new store 
same store includes those stores acquired prior to january of the prior year and developed properties operating for two full years as of january of the current year 
new store represents those storage centers recently acquired or developed for which performance is measured primarily based on original investment expectations 
we evaluate all storage centers on the same basis regardless of our ownership interest in the property 
we believe noi is a meaningful measure of operating performance as a supplement to net income because we rely on noi for purposes of making decisions with respect to resource allocations  current property values  segment performance  and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results 
noi is defined as storage center operations revenues less direct operating and real estate tax expense for each of our properties 
for a reconciliation of same store and new store noi to net income see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following sections discuss the performance of these segments

indirect operating expense is allocated to storage centers based on number of months in operation during the period 
a during  same store revenue increased over  of which relates to storage centers that have been in the same store pool since the beginning of during  same store revenue increased over in  we started to experience erosion in occupancy and in rental rates that we attributed to general economic conditions and to the rate reductions being offered by competitors 
in response to these conditions  we provided additional training to our direct sales team and storage center management personnel  and we re aligned our sales center to improve our closing ratios on inquiries made by customers 
we believe these initiatives  together with an improvement in the general economic conditions starting in the fourth quarter of  resulted in an increase in our average occupancy without having to further adjust our rates downward in in we were able to continue to increase occupancy by and annual rental rates by 
additionally  retail sales and truck rentals contributed approximately million to our revenue increase from to and  from to which reflect improvements in the management of our inventory and the portfolio of retail products offered 
b personnel expenses have increased due to higher salaries for more experienced store managers and employees that are part of our effort to increase quality of service and reduce employee turnover 
also  as a result of achieving certain performance targets  higher bonuses and commissions were paid in increased employee coverage for extended hours and sunday openings and other programs designed to enhance the service 
table of contents and the appearance of our storage centers also contributed to higher personnel expenses both in compared to and in compared to c repair and maintenance costs increased by in over due to the curb appeal initiative  which was an effort to bring the exterior appearance of all stores to a standardized level  and to the higher cost of materials in repair and maintenance costs increased significantly in over due to higher snow removal costs experienced by our properties in the northeastern region of the united states 
additionally  we created a centralized maintenance program that enabled us to accelerate our repair activities for our older us properties 
d the decrease in marketing reflects higher levels of productivity from the consolidation of activities at our sales center along with a reduction of employees in our field sales and marketing functions 
e in cost of goods sold increased  or over the prior year which is proportionate with increases in retail sales 
f leasehold expense increased primarily as a result of the impact of escalation clauses 
g indirect operating expenses increased primarily due to the creation of new management positions in certain regions 
we also created new regional field sales and marketing positions in the new marketing positions allow us to conduct local marketing actions and to provide the flexibility to focus our efforts in the areas where they are most needed 
the increase in marketing expenses is offset by decreases in direct marketing expenses at the store level 
additionally the increase from to reflected increases in salaries incentive compensation expense resulting for the implementation of our decentralized management structure

rather  we use other methods  including primarily comparisons of actual results to targeted noi for the appropriate period from opening or at maturity 
the performance of our domestic acquisitions and developments are discussed in the sections that follow 

table of contents domestic acquisitions we continue to seek acquisition opportunities for high quality storage centers that meet our investment standards 
we have limited our efforts to pursue only those storage centers that enhance our existing network of storage centers or allow us to establish significant market presence in new markets ie establish greater market presence or expand an established market to create greater economies of scale

we also acquired one in each of indiana and new jersey and two in new york for million plus million of assumed debt 
during  we purchased storage centers 
on june   we purchased storage centers from the owners of minnesota mini storage for  shares of our common stock see note to our consolidated financial statements  the equivalent of million 
these storage centers had occupancy of at december  we purchased one additional storage center from a california developer on december  for million 
its occupancy was at december  during  we purchased eight individual storage centers totaling  net rentable square feet for a purchase price of million 
these properties are in the following locations three in indiana  one in maryland  one in california  one in illinois and two in florida 
the average occupancy of these storage centers was as of december  on june   we purchased for million a interest in morningstar  which at the time owned and operated storage centers in north carolina and south carolina that consist of  net rentable square feet 
we also entered into an agreement with certain members of morningstar to form one or more joint ventures for the purpose of developing and operating high quality self storage properties in north carolina and south carolina 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
occupancy for these storage centers is as of december

average annual rent per square foot is calculated by dividing actual rent collected by the average number of square feet occupied during the period 
on the year of opening the average annual rent is lower as the storage center has not been opened a full year 
we normally project new storage properties to rent up at occupancy rates of between and per month 
in order to maintain this pace of rent up over the past three years we have needed to offer reduced rates to attract new customers 
as a result  over the past three years certain of our newly developed storage centers have been renting at a slower pace and our occupancy grew at per month 
however  stores opened in appear to be renting up faster 
we can give no assurance that the projections noted above regarding the development projects will occur 
actual occupancy levels and rates could be lower if we experience competition from other self storage properties and other storage alternatives in close proximity to our developments 
in  we opened nine new storage centers 
we opened four facilities in the first quarter in california  south carolina  michigan  and new jersey  one facility in the second quarter in washington  and two facilities in the third quarter in pennsylvania and california 
in the fourth quarter we opened two additional stores in texas and colorado 
during  we opened fourteen new storage centers 
certain of these storage centers are still in the early stages of rent up 
the first of these storage centers opened in march  the next three opened in the second quarter  seven opened in the third quarter and the remaining three opened in the fourth quarter 
as of december   the developments had been open for an average of months of operations 
these storage centers had an occupancy rate of at december  and at this stage are performing according to projections  except for two stores that are renting up more slowly  we believe due to competition in their area 
during  we opened fourteen domestic storage centers 
these developments as a group generated million in noi in  have been open for an average of months and had an average occupancy of 
table of contents at december  this represents a rent up that is somewhat below projections 
this is attributable primarily to two storage centers that have been particularly slow to rent up and that had occupancies at december  of and  respectively 
for both and  the stores that were slower to rent up were either located in regions that were going through an economic slow down  such as michigan and northern california  or facing high competition  such as in chicago 
domestic developments under construction in addition to the operating properties discussed in domestic developments  we have nine properties under construction or pending construction 
the following table summarizes the properties under construction as of december number of projects estimated completed cost of projects total cost to date as of december  dollars in thousands developments under construction construction in progress land purchased pending construction total the actual completed cost of these projects could vary due to delays during construction caused by weather  unforeseen site conditions  labor shortages  personnel turnover  scheduling problems with contractors  subcontractors or suppliers  or resource constraints 
included in construction in progress at december  is million in costs related to ongoing capital improvement projects and million for redevelopment of existing storage centers projects 
the remainder of domestic development costs was incurred on projects prior to commencement of construction 
we select stores for redevelopment when we identify opportunities to increase return on investment by upgrading the property 
as of december  we had stores that were going through expansion or redevelopment projects

table of contents b increase in personnel expenses resulted from the creation of sales representative positions in the field targeted at commercial customers in this has especially been the case in france where their additional presence in the storage centers resulted in a positive effect on occupancy 
we had started adding new positions to support sales in the field in  which explains the increase in personnel expenses in compared to c real estate taxes in were unusually low as they were reduced by tax reimbursements received in the united kingdom 
this explains the decrease of real estate taxes in compared to and the increase in compared to d repair and maintenance expenses in increased significantly in belgium and in the netherlands as a result of security enhancements 
repair and maintenance increased to a lower extent in france  sweden and the united kingdom as we are accelerating our repair activities for our older european properties 
in repair and maintenance cost increased compared to due to the creation of more positions dedicated to that function 
e the increases in marketing expenses are due to new programs launched in the third quarter and to higher phone directories expenses 
targeted marketing initiatives and sales training launched during the third quarter accelerated during the fourth quarter  yielding positive results in terms of inquiries and improved our ability to close sales in several markets 
certain marketing actions also resulted in better retention of our existing customers and our ability to market auxiliary services such as retail products 
f the increase in costs of goods sold in is the result of discounts obtained in g the increase in store admin and other expenses results from higher local and other taxes

however  we are currently experiencing slower rent up speed than originally anticipated 
in all markets we have launched targeted marketing and training initiatives  which we believe are starting to generate positive results 
examples of such initiatives in each country are as follows in france sales representatives have been added to improve the revenue from commercial customers 
in sweden we have accelerated training and marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter yielding results in terms of the quality of inquiries and improved closing ratios on inquiries 
in denmark marketing initiatives and sales training have had positive results in inquiries during the year 
in germany rates have been adjusted to lower rates on selected units and intensive marketing campaigns have been launched 
in the netherlands where competition is growing  our marketing initiatives in the third and fourth quarter have reduced the drop in inquiries experienced earlier in  and the replacement of store personnel that took place in the last few months already showed positive results towards the end of development plans have been reduced in the netherlands 
we have also added a country manager 
in  we developed one store in shurgard europe and an aggregate of stores through first shurgard and second shurgard of which six opened in the fourth quarter 
a these storage centers have an estimated total cost at completion of million and an average occupancy of as of december  after an average months of operations

table of contents funds from operations we use funds from operations ffo in addition to net earnings to report our operating results 
we use the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as interpreted by the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on dispositions of interests in depreciated operating properties and real estate depreciation and amortization expenses 
ffo includes our share of ffo of unconsolidated real estate ventures and discontinued operations and excludes minority interests in real estate depreciation and amortization expenses 
we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings because net earnings assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
we believe that the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions 
our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because not all companies calculate ffo in the same manner 
ffo is not a liquidity measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows or indicative of cash available for distribution 
it also should not be considered an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  as an indication of the company s financial performance 
the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
for the year ended december  in thousands net income depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures and subsidiaries gain on sale of operating properties cumulative effect of change in accounting principle ffo preferred distribution preferred stock redemption issue costs ffo attributable to common shareholders excludes depreciation related to non real estate assets and minority interests in depreciation and amortization and includes depreciation and amortization of discontinued operations 
we have included in ffo gains and losses of land and non real estate operating assets of approximately   and million in  and  respectively 
ffo attributable to common shareholders for increased million over ffo for  which had increased million over as previously discussed  this growth reflects the improved revenue performance of the same store portfolio of properties  as well as the addition of properties over the prior year through acquisitions and developments  decreased impairment expenses and a gain on foreign exchange offset by our increased share of losses from our european operations and increased general  administrative and other expenses 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for payments of operating expenses  debt service  dividends on common and preferred stocks  expansions and improvements to existing properties  acquisitions and developments of new properties 
we believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate for our near term and longer term requirements 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents as a reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are required to  among other things  to make distributions to our shareholders of at least of our reit taxable income 
for the years ended december   and  the company distributed million  million and million  respectively  to its shareholders 
we expect to use our cash flow from operating activities for distributions to shareholders and we intend to invest amounts accumulated for these distributions in short term investments 
we rely primarily on the public debt and equity markets for our long term financing 
we have traditionally used proceeds from borrowings under credit facilities to fund our property development and acquisition requirements and subsequently repaid these borrowings with proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
we have also used these proceeds to repay maturing corporate or mortgage debt  to redeem preferred stock  and for other corporate purposes 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
availability under the shelf registration statement was approximately million at december  we are currently unable to issue securities under our shelf registration statements because of late filings of certain of our periodic reports 
we expect to file our periodic reports in a timely manner in the future  however  we cannot assure you when or whether we will do so 
we may issue debt and or equity securities through private placements 
we believe that the development joint venture structure provides several advantages to shurgard europe at this stage in its growth 
it allows shurgard europe to expand the coverage of the shurgard brand with less capital and  therefore  represents a more efficient use of its capital 
even if shurgard europe does not ultimately acquire the properties developed by the joint venture  the development and management fees provide it with a stable source of income 
currently  we employ a joint venture development strategy where we co invest with a private equity partner approximately of the capital needed for developments  we raise the balance needed through credit facilities 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity as of december  dollars in millions total market capitalization debt to total market capitalization weighted average interest rate total market capitalization is based on the closing market price as of december   of the class a common stock  series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock and the series d preferred stock multiplied by their respective total number of outstanding shares plus total debt 
debt includes notes payable  lines of credit and participation rights 
the debt includes our european subsidiaries debt which results in a higher debt to total market capitalization ratio 
in and our unconsolidated european subsidiaries had third party debt totaling million and million  respectively 
represents weighted average interest rate on our outstanding lines of credit and notes payable 
at december   we had unsecured revolving domestic credit facilities with a group of lenders that provide for aggregate borrowings of up to million and a million unsecured term loan from a sub group of the same lenders 
the revolving credit facility and the term loan matured in february in february  we obtained a new million unsecured revolving credit facility  and a million unsecured term loan which was fully drawn at closing 
the revolving tranche of the facility is available until february and the term tranche of 
table of contents the facility is available until august availability of either tranche can be extended at our option for one year for a fee 
the new facility bears interest at london interbank offer rate libor plus a margin based on the ratings assigned to our senior unsecured long term debt securities 
at closing of the facility our margin was on the revolving credit facility and on the term loan based on credit ratings by moody s investor service  inc moody s of baa  standard poor s ratings services of bbb and fitch  inc of bbb 
subsequent to the closing of the new facility moody s announced a downgrade of our senior unsecured long term debt to baa the margins payable on our credit facilities would increase by if another rating agency downgrades our credit rating 
borrowings under the revolving tranche of the new facility can be used for various purposes  including project acquisition and development costs  repayment of debt and other corporate needs 
we are continually evaluating sources of capital and believe they are available to meet our liquidity needs without necessitating sales of additional properties 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facility  we have other sources of capital 
at december   we were holding two operating properties for sale 
in january  we sold one of them at a sales price of approximately million and in february we sold the other property for million 
we may sell other properties if market conditions warrant in we may also sell peripheral land parcels 
our contractual cash obligations and construction cost commitments are summarized as follows at december  thereafter total in thousands debt scheduled principal payments balloon payments capital lease obligations operating leases construction commitments domestic shurgard europe first shurgard second shurgard commitments to lend derivative financial instruments total the balloon payments due in consist of million of borrowings under our us credit facilities 
we repaid this amount in february using borrowings under our new credit facilities described above 
the remaining balloon payments are due on mortgages and are expected to be repaid with proceeds from refinancing  corporate borrowings or borrowings on our credit facility 
we expect to spend more than million including the construction costs set forth above for new developments  expansions and improvements to existing properties in this includes million expenditures in our european markets the majority of which will be in first shurgard and second shurgard 
we expect to fund the construction commitments of first shurgard and second shurgard with borrowings on their secured credit facilities and capital contributions from the partners 
first shurgard has a credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to million million at december   bears interest at euribor euro interbank offered rate plus and matures in may availability under the facility declines by million million as of december  per quarter beginning in december and by million million as of december  per quarter beginning in may and may be extended 
table of contents for one year if we meet certain operating covenants 
availability under the facility at december  was million million and the facility was collateralized by assets with a carrying value of million 
second shurgard has a credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to million million at december   bears interest at euribor plus  matures in and may be extended for one year if we meet certain operating covenants 
availability under the facility at december  was million million and the facility was collateralized by assets with a carrying value of million 
second shurgard also has million of equity capital available to be issued of which will be contributed by our partners in the joint venture 
borrowings under both the first shurgard and second shurgard credit facilities may only be used to fund property development costs of first shurgard and second shurgard 
we expect that internally generated cash flows within shurgard europe will be sufficient to fund shurgard europe s equity commitments to both first shurgard and second shurgard 
the following table summarizes our cash flows activity for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was attributable primarily to the timing of certain payments

the majority of our development in europe was done through first shurgard and second shurgard which were financed primarily by borrowings on their credit facilities and by capital contributions by us and our joint venture partners 
in july  we purchased the remaining shares of recom  through which we hold part of our ownership interest in shurgard europe for approximately million cash and the forgiveness of a note of approximately

these cash proceeds were partially offset by the following payments million distributions paid on common and preferred stock  million repayment of shurgard europe s euro denominated bridge loan facility  million repayment of senior unsecured notes at maturity  million repayment on participation rights  and million repayment on domestic mortgage notes payable 
in october  shurgard europe completed a million secured bond offering  the proceeds of which it used to repay its credit facility 
the bonds are collateralized by storage centers wholly owned by shurgard europe that had a net book value of million as of december  and contain various financial covenants 
the notes are due on october  the notes are structured in three tranches  with a weighted average interest rate of over euribor 
shurgard europe has entered into interest rate and currency swap agreements in order to hedge its interest rate exposure and to fix the interest rate through maturity at 
additionally  on october  shurgard europe obtained a million senior credit facility available in the event of a liquidity shortfall through the legal maturity of the bonds 
using borrowing under our line of credit  we repaid our senior unsecured notes upon their maturity in april and in december  retired the remaining participation rights liability 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities in included million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of common stock  million of proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes  and million proceeds from new domestic mortgage notes 
these cash proceeds were partially offset by the following payments million distributions paid on our common and preferred stock  million repayment of mortgage notes payable  on march   we issued million net proceeds of million in senior unsecured notes due in the notes require semi annual interest payments due march and september we used the proceeds from the notes to repay credit facility borrowings that were used to fund the acquisition of additional interests in shurgard europe 
on july   we raised approximately million of net proceeds through the sale of million shares of our common stock 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to fund the acquisition of an additional ownership interest in shurgard europe 
we used additional proceeds to repay a portion of the indebtedness under our line of credit 
cash provided by financing activities in included million from net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock  million of net additional draws on our domestic revolving line of credit  and million proceeds from new domestic mortgage notes 
these cash proceeds were partially offset by the following payments million distributions paid on our common and preferred stock  million redemption of our series b redeemable preferred stock  and million repayment on mortgage notes payable 
on june   we raised approximately million net proceeds through the sale of million shares of class a common stock 
on august   we used approximately million of the proceeds to redeem in full our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock issued on april  prior to the closing of the offering  we borrowed under our revolving credit facility to fund the balance of the million purchase of the interest in morningstar 
we repaid a portion of these borrowings with proceeds from the offering 
in connection with the purchase of our interest in morningstar  we assumed notes payable of million with an aggregate fair value of million and recorded a premium on these notes of million representing of the difference between face value and fair value 
these notes have various interest rates ranging from to per annum and mature between and off balance sheet transactions we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  
table of contents item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate debt arrangements 
we have implemented a policy to protect against interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes payable  primarily at fixed interest rates  and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate lock agreements  interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on existing or future borrowings 
our investment policy prohibits us from entering into any such contract solely to secure profit by speculating on the direction of currency exchange or interest rates if unrelated to capital borrowed lent or invested by us 
we have foreign currency exposures related to our investment in the construction  acquisition  and operation of storage centers in countries outside the united states to the extent such activities are financed with financial instruments or equity denominated in non functional currencies 
since all foreign debt is denominated in the corresponding functional currency  our currency exposure is limited to our equity investment in those countries 
countries in which we have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations include belgium  france  the netherlands  sweden  denmark  germany and the united kingdom 
our net investment in these foreign operations at december  was in excess of million  most of which we consider long term and our net loss from our foreign operations was million 
also  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intercompany debt with our european subsidiaries that is not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or the investee 
a hypothetical decrease of the euro against the us dollar over a given reporting period would result in an unrealized foreign exchange loss of approximately million in that period as a result of adjusting the intercompany debt to period end rates 
the table below summarizes annual debt maturities weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt at the end of each year based on a libor and a euribor of at december  and a forward yield curve for following years and fair values required to evaluate our expected cash flows under debt agreements and our sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  in thousands
