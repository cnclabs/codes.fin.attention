general we are the world leader in drill stem technology development and drill pipe manufacturing  sales and service  a global leader in drill bit technology  manufacturing  sales and service  and a leading provider of high performance engineered connections and premium tubular products and services 
we operate primarily through three business segments drilling products and services  drill bits and tubular technology and services 
market trends and outlook our business is primarily dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity worldwide  which  in turn  depends on the level of capital spending by major  independent and state owned exploration and production companies 
this capital spending is driven by current prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices 
all of our business segments generally track the level of domestic and international drilling activity  however  their revenues  cash flows and profitability follow the rig count at different stages within the market cycles 
drill pipe demand is also a function of customer inventory levels and typically lags changes in the worldwide rig count 
in a declining market  customers are contractually required to purchase ordered drill pipe even if they will no longer need that pipe 
this creates a situation where our customers have an inventory of excess drill pipe 
consequently  in a market with increasing activity  customers delay purchasing until they no longer have sufficient inventory to sustain current and near term expected future activity 
drill bit demand and this segment s earnings and cash flows have closely tracked the worldwide rig count 
within our tubular technology and services segment  there are four product lines atlas bradford premium connections  tube alloy accessories  tca premium casing and xl systems large bore connections and services 
results for this segment s atlas bradford  tube alloy and tca product lines predominantly follow changes in north american in particular gulf of mexico offshore drilling  deep drilling and natural gas drilling rig counts  but short term demand for atlas bradford products also can be affected by inventories at octg distributors 
the tca product line also is affected by the level of us octg mill activity 
this segments xl systems product line generally follows the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity 

table of contents for the periods below  the revenues  profitability  and cash flows from each of our business segments have been impacted by changes in oil and gas prices and rig counts 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and gas prices at the dates indicated and the north american us and canadian and international rig counts for the periods reflected year ended december  wti oil a average ending henry hub gas b average ending north american rig count c average ending international rig count c average ending a price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude as of the dates presented above 
source bloomberg energy commodity service 
b price per mmbtu as of the dates presented above 
source bloomberg energy commodity service 
c source baker hughes rig count international rig count excludes china and the former soviet union 
future market trends and expectations looking forward  we anticipate that our results will be based on the level of drilling activity and our customers views regarding the sustainability of that activity 
these perceptions depend on their views regarding the sustainability of oil and natural gas prices 
commodity prices were particularly strong during  and this resulted in strong drilling activity 
when forecasting our results for  we relied on several assumptions about the market  our customers  our suppliers and the company 
in the market  we anticipate continuing improvement in drilling activity  with average worldwide rig counts up to over importantly  we anticipate that our customers will continue to believe in the sustainability of drilling activity 
for all business units  we believe price improvements are justifiable and achievable  and we will be able to modestly increase prices to our customers 
as such  we believe our results will improve over on december   total backlog was up million from december  to million this is the highest level since the company became public in april  the improved backlog with strong drilling activity are expected to translate into a to increase in volumes at our drilling products and services segment 
revenues at our drill bits segment should move commensurate with the rig count  and our tubular technology and services segment  with its strong leverage to the weak gulf of mexico rig count  should benefit from a full year of restructurings and pricing improvements made during

also contributing to the revenues increase are increased sales of tool joints  heavyweight drill pipe and drill collars and this segment s results reflect the benefits from the rationalization program implemented at the beginning of  which increased facility utilization and provided efficiency improvements 
drill bits revenues for the drill bits segment increased million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues in us and canada reflecting the increase in the north american rig count  increased revenues at certain international regions due to focused sales and marketing efforts and increased revenues from the company s acquisition of diamond products international  inc dpi in august this segment continues to have success in its newly developed product lines  which include reedhycalog s rotary steerable bit technologies and directional products  reedhycalog s trex tm diamond technology and the tuffcutter tm  tuffduty tm and titan tm lines of roller cone products 
operating income increased million  or  which includes transition costs mentioned above of million in  however operating income margins decreased slightly from to

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases purchase obligation a total contractual obligations after total year years years years commercial commitments letters of credit 
table of contents a we have entered into a supply agreement with voest alpine which provides that we purchase a minimum quantity of tubulars per year through july  although we are not contractually obligated to purchase an annual minimum commitment  the contract does include a penalty for every metric ton that a two year average of purchases fall below the annual purchase minimum 
the maximum annual penalty due under the contract would be approximately million euros annually 
the amounts in the table reflect the amount of this contractual penalty assuming we made no purchases from voest alpine and were converted from euros to us dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate 
related party transactions until april   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of weatherford 
we were spun off from weatherford on april   through a distribution by weatherford to its stockholders of all of our common stock 
weatherford no longer owns any interest in our company 
prior to our annual meeting held in may  we had seven directors  five of which also served on the board of weatherford 
currently  we now have nine directors  of which only three serve on weatherford s board 
in connection with the spinoff  we entered into a preferred supplier agreement with weatherford in which weatherford agreed to purchase at least of its requirements of drill stem products from us  subject to certain exceptions 
in return  we agreed to sell those products at prices not greater than that at which we sell to similarly situated customers  and we provided weatherford a million credit towards the purchase of those products 
during  we extended the term of this contract by two years and reduced the unused preferred supplier credit balance by million 
the effect of this reduction in the supplier credit was a reduction in the accrued liability as a credit to other income 
such adjustment is reflected in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  at december   the remaining credit balance was million 
weatherford purchased approximately million of drill stem products from us during weatherford also purchased api tubing and accessory threading services from us aggregating million during our drill bits segment sells drill bits worldwide to oil and gas operators  including newfield exploration company newfield 
in addition  a division of our tubular technology and services segment also sells accessories directly to newfield 
two of our directors  mr 
trice and mr 
hendrix  are directors of newfield and mr 
trice is newfield s chairman  president and chief executive officer 
during  newfield purchased approximately million of products from us 
we believe that the prices we charge are on terms comparable to those that would be available to unaffiliated third parties 
during  our supply agreement with voest alpine was amended 
the amended agreement provided for a reduced minimum quantity commitment per year through july   effective april  the amendment also provides for a surcharge provision under which actual costs of key raw materials in the green pipe production process will be indexed to the april base cost and surcharges per ton assessed accordingly for the difference 
these surcharges are phased in and did not significantly impact  however  they will be in place for forward 
the contract includes a penalty for every metric ton that a two year average of purchases fall below the annual purchase minimum 
during  we met our minimum purchase requirements and we currently believe we will meet our contractual commitments for without incurring unnecessary penalties or material unnecessary inventory positions 
off balance sheet financing we do not have any off balance sheet hedging  financing arrangements or contracts except those associated with our investments in two companies that are not consolidated in our financial statements voest alpine and intelliserv 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities of voest alpine are summarized in note additionally  voest alpine has entered into forward contracts to cover its currency risk related to accounts receivables and accounts payables  has entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to changes in floating interest rate payments of its long term bonds  and has also entered into an agreement with a bank to sell a significant portion of its

intelliserv is our technology joint venture that is currently developing technology for intelligent drill pipe that permits real time transfer of data through the drill string 
intelliserv does not have any debt  other than trade payables relating primarily to research and development expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company obtains employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using apb no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
this statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  july  for the company 
early adoption of sfas r is encouraged 
this statement applies to all awards granted or modified after the statement s effective date 
in addition  compensation cost for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on the statement s effective date shall be recognized on or after the effective date  as the related services are rendered  based on the awards grant date fair value as previously calculated for the pro forma disclosure under sfas we expect that upon the adoption of sfas r  we will apply the modified prospective application transition method  as permitted by the statement 
under such transition method  upon the adoption of sfas r  our financial statements for periods prior to the effective date of the statement will not be restated 
the impact of this statement on our financial statements or its results of operations in and beyond will depend upon various factors  among them our future compensation strategy 
we expect that the effect of applying this statement on our results of operations in as it relates to existing option plans would not be materially different from the sfas pro forma effect previously reported 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our financial statements 
the american jobs creation act of the act enacted on october  provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated foreign earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  certain criteria in the act must be satisfied 
we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the act and if so  the amount that will be repatriated 
through december   we have not provided deferred taxes on certain foreign earnings because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
whether we will take advantage of this provision depends on a number of factors including reviewing future congressional guidance before a decision can be made 
until that time  we will make no change in our current intention to indefinitely reinvest certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
if we were to repatriate these earnings  a one time tax benefit to our consolidated statements of operations of up to approximately million could occur 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employer s disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
the revised statement requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original statement about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit post retirement plans 
as revised  sfas no 
r is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures required by this statement were effective for interim periods beginning after december  however  
table of contents disclosure of the estimated future benefit payments was effective for fiscal years ending after june  we adopted sfas r during the adoption of sfas r did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
see note for disclosures regarding our defined benefit pension plans 
in january  the fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
was issued 
fin no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to variable interest entities vie s  which are certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties 
the interpretation is intended to achieve more consistent application of consolidation policies to vie s and  thus  to improve comparability between enterprises engaged in similar activities even if some of those activities are conducted through vie s 
fin no 
requires the entity  which absorbs a majority of the variable income or loss of a vie be considered the primary beneficiary and requires consolidation of the vie 
the interpretation was effective immediately for vie s created after january   and to vie s in which we obtain an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin no 
 fin no 
r  to clarify some of the provisions of fin no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
under the new guidance  special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied fin no 
prior to issuance of this revised interpretation 
otherwise  application of fin no 
r was required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities  other than small business issuers  for all other types of vie s was required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we are not a primary beneficiary of a vie nor do we hold any significant interests or involvement in a vie 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to the drilling products and services and tubular technology and services segments  this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  the sales price is fixed or determinable  the manufacturing process is complete including completion of all proper inspections  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and all delivery obligations have been met 
if requested in writing by the customer  delivery may be satisfied through delivery to our customer storage location or to a third party storage facility 
with respect to our drill bits segment  revenue is recognized when the customer runs the drill bit 
customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when we have completed all of our performance obligations related to the sale 
we also recognize revenues as services are performed 
additionally  we recognize revenues associated with rebillable shipping costs 
deferred revenues and charges for sales transactions where title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer but the supporting documentation does not meet all of the criteria for revenue recognition prior to the products being in the physical possession of the customer  recognition of the revenues and related inventory costs from these transactions are required to be deferred until the customer takes physical possession 
at december   we had deferred revenues and charges related to such transactions of million and million  
table of contents respectively 
the deferred charges represent customer owned finished goods inventory on deferred sales transactions for which legal title transfer has occurred  but the product is not yet in the customer s physical possession 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the restatement of the first three quarters of the impact of deferred revenues and charges on prior years financial statements was not material 
inventories inventory costs are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we value our inventories primarily using standard costs  which approximate actual costs  that include raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead allocations 
we performs obsolescence reviews on our slow moving and excess inventories and establish reserves based on current assessments of factors such as age of inventory  technological obsolescence  future product demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if such factors are different than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the cost of business acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using third party appraisals and management estimates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
in addition  estimated liabilities to exit activities of an acquired operation or an existing operation  including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees  are subject to change as management continues its assessment of operations and finalizes its integration and exit plans 
long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to expected undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less selling costs 
in  we recorded fixed asset impairments of million related to the write off of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures resulting from the relocation of our corporate office in september while we believe no other impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to at least an annual impairment test and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  a second step test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the years expected to be benefited  ranging from to years 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we do not believe any of our goodwill is impaired as of december  while we believe no impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or 
table of contents changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxable profitability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
contingent liabilities we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the actual costs of these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision to cover an expected loss based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities primarily include litigation  warranty claims  environmental liabilities and contract claims 
while management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
pension plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit pension plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations as of the period end 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
forward looking statements and exposures in light of the sec s regulation fd  we have elected to provide in this report various forward looking statements and operational details 
we have done so to assure full market disclosure of information that we generally make available to our investors and securities analysts 
we expect to provide updates to this information on a regular basis in our periodic and current reports filed with the sec 
we have also made our 
table of contents investor conference calls open to all investors and encourage all investors to listen in on these calls 
we will publicly announce the call in information in a press release before such calls 
we are providing this information to assist our stockholders in better understanding our business 
these expectations reflect only our current view on these matters as of the date of this report and are subject to change based on changes of facts and circumstances 
there can be no assurance that these expectations will be met and our actual results will likely vary up or down from those currently projected 
these estimates speak only of our expectations as of the date of this report and we make no undertaking to update this information 
the absence of an update should not be considered as an affirmation of our current expectations or that facts have not changed during the quarter that would impact our expectations 
risk factors and exposures the businesses in which we operate are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could have adverse consequences on our results of operations and financial condition and that could cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report and in our other disclosures 
investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when evaluating our company and the forward looking statements that we make 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following a decline in domestic and worldwide oil and gas drilling activity would adversely affect our results of operations 
our forward looking statements and projections of future results assume stable to moderately increasing demand for our products and services 
however  our businesses are materially dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity in north america and worldwide  which in turn depends on the level of capital spending by major  independent and state owned exploration and production companies 
this capital spending is driven by current prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices 
oil and gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuation in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty  world events  governmental actions  and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including the level of north american and worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity  worldwide economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in north america  oil and gas production costs  the expected costs of developing new reserves  national government political requirements and the policies of the opec  the price and availability of alternative fuels  environmental regulation  and tax policies 
decreased demand for our products results not only from periods of lower drilling activity  but also from the resulting build up of customer inventory of drill pipe associated with idle rigs  which can be used on active rigs in lieu of new purchases 
the time period during which drill pipe inventory is used is a function of the number of rigs actively drilling and the expected level of drilling activity 
a decrease in the number of rigs actively drilling results in a large amount of unused drill pipe on idle rigs and a decrease in demand for new drill pipe 

table of contents an economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 
the us and worldwide economies have been very volatile  and their future directions are uncertain 
if north american or international economies decline unexpectedly  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
increases in the prices of our raw materials could affect our results of operations 
we use large amounts of steel tubulars and bars in the manufacture of our products 
the price of these raw materials has a significant impact on our cost of producing products 
if we are unable to pass future raw material price increases on to our customers  our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
steel prices have increased significantly since the end of  caused primarily by significant increases in the prices paid by our suppliers for scrap and coke utilized in their operations 
in addition  rising steel costs also have the potential to delay increases in demand for our drill stem components and premium casing products 
as drill stem products are not consumables  our customers could elect to defer purchases until such time as they determine that steel prices have stabilized or returned to more normalized conditions 
our forward looking statements do not assume that there will be any reduced demand for our drill stem products or premium casing as a result of increased prices caused by the current shortages being experienced in the worldwide steel markets 
reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
interruptions of supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on various suppliers to supply the components utilized to manufacture our drilling products and premium casing 
the availability of the raw materials is not only a function of the availability of steel  but also the alloy materials that are utilized by our suppliers in manufacturing tubulars that meet our proprietary chemistries 
currently  there is a worldwide shortage of scrap  coke and alloys that has caused raw material prices to increase for steel tubulars  billets and bars utilized in our manufacturing operations 
to date  these shortages have not caused a material disruption in availability or our manufacturing operations  however  there can be no assurance that material disruptions could not occur in the future 
if material disruptions to raw materials availability occur  it could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to increase our manufacturing operations to meet the increased revenues upon which our forward looking statements are based 
due to intense competition in our industry  our revenues may decline if we do not develop  produce  and commercialize new competitive technologies and products or if we are unable to adequately protect our current and future intellectual property rights relating to our technologies and products 
the markets for our premium products and services are characterized by continual developments 
substantial improvements in the scope and quality of product function and performance can occur over a short period of time 
in order to remain competitive  we must be able to develop commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology 
our ability to develop new products and maintain competitive advantages depends on our ability to design and commercially market products that meet the needs of our customers  including delivery schedules and product specifications 
additionally  the time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercially feasible applications that provide revenues 
we could be required to write off our entire investment in a new product that does not reach commercial viability 
moreover  we may experience operating losses after new products are introduced and commercialized because of high start up costs  unexpected manufacturing costs or problems  or lack of demand 
many of our products and the processes we use to manufacture them have been granted us and international patent protection  or have patent applications pending 
nevertheless  patents may not be granted for our applications and  if patents are issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficient to protect our 
table of contents technology 
if our patents are not enforceable  or if any of our products infringe patents held by others  our financial results may be adversely affected 
our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents  which is especially true internationally where the protection of intellectual property rights may not be as effective 
in addition  obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection internationally may be significantly more expensive than doing so domestically 
we may have to spend substantial time and money defending our patents and  after our patents expire  our competitors will not be legally constrained from developing products substantially similar to ours 
our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon our ability to successfully increase and decrease  without material disruption  our manufacturing capacity and expense in response to changes in demand and to maintain prices for our products  which can be adversely affected by changes in industry conditions and competitive forces 
our projections assume steady to modest increasing demand for our products and services during  in particular our drill stem products 
in the event demand for these products increases  we will be required to increase our production during peak demand periods with minimal operational disruption and inefficiency 
if this does not happen  or we experience difficulties in this regard  our results of operations during this ramp up for high demand periods could be adversely affected 
our international operations may experience severe interruptions due to political  economic  or other risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for the year ended december   we have derived approximately of our total revenues from our facilities outside the us in addition  a large part of sales from our domestic locations were for use in foreign countries 
in addition  many of our key manufacturing operations are outside of the us  including mexico  italy  united kingdom  china  indonesia  and singapore 
our operations in certain international locations are subject to various political and economic conditions existing in those countries that could disrupt operations 
these risks include changes in foreign tax laws  changes in regulations and labor practices  currency fluctuations and devaluations  currency restrictions  banking crises  and limitations on repatriation of profits  and political instability or military conflict 
our foreign operations may suffer disruptions  and we may incur losses that will not be covered by insurance 
we have not historically carried political risk insurance 
in particular  terrorist attacks and other threats to us national security and resulting us military activity throughout the world increase the possibility that our operations could be interrupted or adversely affected 
such disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely and cost effective manner or our inability to place contractors and employees in various countries or regions 
any material currency fluctuations or devaluations  or political events that disrupt oil and gas exploration and production or the movement of funds and assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
as of december   approximately million of our revenues were earned by our chinese operations 
as is customary in this country  it is common for our chinese operations to settle receivables and payables through bearer bonds and notes 
at december   we were not holding any such notes 
to date  our chinese operations have not experienced significant losses as a result of such practice  however  there can be no assurance that such losses could not occur in the future 
any such losses could have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur 

table of contents we have renewed an agreement with voest alpine  an entity of which we own  to purchase green tubulars through september our future results could be adversely affected if we are unable to use or resell these tubulars 
in addition  we have agreed to be responsible for paying any anti dumping duties in the us on the resale of these tubulars  which could affect our ability to resell the tubulars in the us further  our long term supply contract with voest alpine is denominated in euros 
we have no significant offset for revenues in euros and we have not hedged for currency risk with respect to this contract 
thus  a material long term strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
in connection with our business operations  we could be subject to substantial liability claims that adversely affect our results of operations 
our products are complex  and the failure of this equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers costs of drilling a well 
in addition  many of these products are used in hazardous drilling and production applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life  damage to property  equipment  or the environment  regulatory investigations and penalties  and the suspension of the end user s operations 
if our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures  we could face warranty  contract  or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer 
our insurance may not be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur or be responsible 
moreover  in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate or at premiums that are reasonable for us  particularly in the recent environment of significant insurance premium increases 
further  any claims made under our policies will likely cause our premiums to increase 
any future damages deemed to be caused by our products or services that are assessed against us and that are not covered by insurance  or that are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
litigation and claims for which we are not insured can occur  including employee claims  intellectual property claims  breach of contract claims  and warranty claims 
our forward looking statements assume that such uninsured claims or issues will not occur 
we account for warranty reserves on a specific identification basis 
as a result  a significant unexpected warranty issue during a particular quarter or year could cause a material reduction in our results of operations in the quarter or year that the reserve for such warranty is made 
we are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contaminated sites 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products 
because we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations  we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials  and any related personal injury damages or toxic tort claims 
we have not historically carried insurance for such matters 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to the hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities 
those laws and regulations may subject us to material 
table of contents financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any such financial liability or business disruption could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by actions under us trade laws and new foreign entrants into us markets 
although we are a us based manufacturing company  we do own and operate international manufacturing operations that support our us based business 
if actions under us trade laws were instituted that limited our access to these products  our ability to meet our customer specifications and delivery requirements would be reduced 
any adverse effects on our ability to import products from our foreign subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
additionally  foreign producers of tubular goods have been found to have sold their products  which may include premium connections  for export to the us at prices that are lower than the cost of production  or their prices in their home market  or a major third country market 
anti dumping orders restricting the manner and price at which tubular goods from certain countries can be imported are currently in effect 
if such orders are revoked or changed  we could be exposed to increased competition from imports that could reduce our sales and market share 
in addition  the premium connections market served by our atlas bradford product line is highly competitive 
the level of competition could further increase if foreign steel mills  with their own lines of internationally accepted premium connections  more successfully penetrate the us market  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that we enter into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
refer to note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information on financial instruments 
foreign currency risk the functional currency for the majority of our international operations is the us dollar 
adjustments resulting from the remeasurment of the local currency financial statements into the u 
s dollar functional currency  which uses a combination of current and historical exchange rates  are included in net income in the current period 
the functional currency of our canadian  venezuelan and chinese operations is the local currency 
adjustments resulting from the translation of the local functional currency financial statements to the u 
s dollar  which is based on current exchange rates  are included in stockholders equity in the current period 
in addition  our long term supply contract with voest alpine is denominated in euros 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in income for the period 
net foreign currency transaction gains losses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the foreign currency transaction losses realized in were primarily from the us dollar weakening in relation to the euro and british pound 
the foreign currency transaction gains realized in relate primarily to the strengthening of the canadian dollar and the british pound in relation to the us dollar 

table of contents interest rates we are and will be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our long term debt 
the following table summarizes our debt obligations at december  and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates thereafter in thousands long term debt fixed rate average interest rate thereafter in thousands long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate as of december   our long term borrowings at variable rates were paid off  therefore  we were not exposed to the risk of cash flow variability due to increased or decreased interest expense in the event of changes in short term interest rates 
however  the company s fixed rate senior notes outstanding at december  subject the company to risks related to changes in the fair value of the debt and exposes the company to potential gains or losses if it were to repay or refinance such debt 
a change in market interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million to million 
the fair value of financial instruments which differed from their carrying value at december  and  were as follows december  carrying fair carrying fair value value value value in millions senior notes due senior notes due
