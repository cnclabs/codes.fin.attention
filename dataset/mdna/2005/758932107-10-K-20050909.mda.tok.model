item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s overview regis corporation rgs is the beauty industry s global leader in beauty salons  hair restoration centers and education 
as of june   our worldwide operations included  system wide north american and international salons  hair restoration centers and beauty schools 
each of our salon concepts offer generally similar products and services and serves mass market consumers 
our salon operations are organized to be managed based on geographical location 
our north american salon operations include  salons  including  franchise salons  operating in the united states  canada and puerto rico primarily under the trade names of regis salons  mastercuts  trade secret  smartstyle  supercuts and cost cutters 
our international salon operations include  salons  including  franchise salons  located throughout europe  primarily in the united kingdom  france  italy and spain 
in december  we purchased hair club for men and women 
this enterprise includes north american locations  including corporate and franchise locations 
our beauty schools are managed in aggregate  regardless of geographical location  and include locations in the united states and four locations in the united kingdom 
during fiscal year  we had approximately  corporate employees worldwide 
our growth strategy consists of two primary  but flexible  building blocks 
through a combination of organic and acquisition growth  we seek to achieve our long term objective of to percent annual revenue growth 
we anticipate that going forward  the mix of organic and acquisition growth will be roughly equal 
however  depending on several factors  including the ability of our salon development program to keep pace with the availability of real estate for new construction  student enrollment  hair restoration lead generation  the availability of attractive acquisition candidates and same store sales trends  this mix will vary from year to year 
we believe achieving revenue growth of to percent  including same store sales increases in excess of two percent  will allow us to increase annual earnings at a low to mid teen percent growth rate 
we anticipate expanding our presence in both north america and europe 
additionally  we desire to enter the asian market within the next five years 
maintaining financial flexibility is a key element in continuing our successful growth 
with strong operating cash flow and an investment grade balance sheet  we are confident that we will be able to financially support our long term growth objectives 
salon business the strength of our salon business is in the fundamental similarity and broad appeal of our salon concepts that allow flexibility and multiple salon concept placements in shopping centers and neighborhoods 
each concept generally targets the middle market customer  however each attracts a different demographic 
we anticipate expanding all of our salon concepts 
in addition  we anticipate testing and developing new salon concepts to complement our existing concepts 
we execute our salon growth strategy by focusing on real estate 
our salon real estate strategy is to add new units in convenient locations with good visibility and customer traffic  as well as appropriate trade demographics 
our various salon and product concepts operate in a wide range of retailing environments  including regional shopping malls  strip centers and wal mart supercenters 
we believe that the availability of real estate will augment our ability to achieve the aforementioned long term growth objectives 
we anticipate that we will add between to  net salons each year through a combination of organic  acquisition and franchise growth 
organic salon revenue growth is achieved through the combination of new salon construction and salon same store sales increases 
each fiscal year  we anticipate building several hundred corporate salons 
we anticipate our franchisees will open several hundred salons as well 
older  unprofitable salons will be closed or relocated 
our long term outlook for our salon business is for annual consolidated low single digit same store sales increases 
based on current fashion and economic cycles eg  longer hairstyles and lengthening of customer visitation patterns  we project our annual fiscal year consolidated same store sales increase to be below the low end of our long term outlook range 
historically  our salon acquisitions have varied in size from as small as one salon to over one thousand salons 
the median acquisition size is approximately ten salons 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  we completed acquisitions  adding a net of  salons 
we anticipate adding several hundred corporate salons each year from acquisitions 
some of these acquisitions may include buying salons from our franchisees 
hair restoration business in december  we acquired hair club for men and women 
hair club for men and women is the industry leading provider of hair loss solutions with an estimated five percent share of the billion domestic market 
this industry is comprised of approximately  locations domestically and is highly fragmented 
as a result  we believe there is an opportunity to consolidate this industry through acquisition 
expanding the hair loss business organically and through acquisition would allow us to add incremental revenue which is neither dependent upon  nor dilutive to  our existing salon and school businesses 
our organic growth plans for hair restoration include the construction of a modest number of new locations in untapped markets domestically and internationally 
however  the success of our hair restoration business is not dependent on the same real estate criteria used for salon expansion 
in an effort to provide confidentiality for their customers  hair restoration centers operate primarily in professional or medical office buildings 
further  the hair restoration business is more marketing intensive 
as a result  organic growth at our hair restoration centers will be dependent on successfully generating new leads and converting them into hair restoration customers 
our growth expectations for our hair restoration business are not dependent on referral business from  or cross marketing with  our hair salon business  but will be evaluated closely for additional growth opportunities 
beauty school business we have begun acquiring and are exploring the possibility of building beauty schools 
the beauty school business is highly profitable  and often participates in governmental programs designed to encourage education 
we believe there is an opportunity to place graduates in our various salon concepts which may provide us with another competitive advantage 
similar to the salon and hair loss industries  the beauty school industry is highly fragmented 
as a result  we believe there is an opportunity to consolidate this industry through acquisition  as well 
expanding this business would allow us to add incremental revenue without cannibalizing our existing salon or hair restoration center businesses 
primarily through acquisition  we believe beauty schools could contribute over million in annual revenue within a few years 
our organic growth plans for the beauty school business include the construction of new locations  however  due to us department of education policies  we will be limited in the number of new schools we are able to construct in the immediate future 
the success of a beauty school location is not dependent on good visibility or strong customer traffic  however  access to parking and or public transportation is important 
the success of existing and newly constructed schools is dependent on effective marketing and recruiting to attract new enrollees

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually or at any time events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
according to our accounting policy  an annual review is performed in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates of revenues for the reporting units  driven by assumed organic growth rates  estimated future gross margin and expense rates  as well as acquisition integration and maturation  and appropriate discount and tax rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that are used to manage the underlying businesses 
charges for impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit may be incurred if the reporting unit fails to achieve its assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin  or if interest rates increase significantly 
we generally consider our various concepts to be reporting units when we test for goodwill impairment because that is where we believe goodwill naturally resides 
during the quarter ending march   we reduced our expectations for the european business based on recent growth trends 
based on the results of our third quarter fiscal year goodwill impairment testing  which factored in these revised growth trend expectations  we wrote down the carrying value of the european business to reflect its estimated fair value 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax  non cash charge of million during the third quarter 
two of the most significant assumptions underlying the determination of fair value of goodwill for our european business are discount and tax rates 
in connection with the measurement we performed during the third quarter  a basis point increase in the discount rate we used would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million instead of million  while a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
additionally  a five percent increase in the tax rate would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million instead of million  while a five percent decrease in the tax rate would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
our impairment analysis is performed on a salon by salon basis 
factors considered in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of an individual salon in relation to expectations  significant economic or geographic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the related total estimated future net cash flows 
if an asset s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
purchase price allocation we make numerous acquisitions 
the purchase prices are allocated to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
fair value is estimated based on the amount for which the asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
for our acquisitions  the majority of the purchase price that is not allocated to identifiable assets  or liabilities assumed  is accounted for as residual goodwill rather than identifiable intangible assets 
this stems from the value associated with the walk in customer base of the acquired salons  the value of which is not recorded as an identifiable intangible asset under current accounting guidance and the limited value of the acquired leased site and customer preference associated with the acquired hair salon brand 
residual goodwill further represents our opportunity to strategically combine the acquired business with our existing structure to serve a greater number of customers through our expansion strategies 
revenue recognition company owned salon revenues  beauty school revenues from services performed or products sold  and service and product sale revenues occurring in hair restoration centers which do not require future services  along with the related gross margins  are recorded at the time of sale 
this treatment results as services are provided or delivery occurs for product revenues  and the customer s payment is received  at the time of sale 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
based on historical results  refunds to the customer represent less than one percent of total company owned revenues 
the vast majority of returns and refunds occur within a matter of days of the original sales transaction 
a significant increase in returns or refunds could have a material impact on revenues disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
beauty school tuition payments are originally recorded as deferred revenues 
the earnings process is culminated once the company performs under the terms of the contract ie  instructs a class 
therefore  revenue is recognized and deferred revenue is reversed proportionally as the classes are held 
based on this practice  little judgment is exercised related to recognizing beauty school tuition revenues 
however  we must estimate our expected exposure to refunds and uncollectible accounts  which are recorded as a reduction to tuition revenues 
a significant variance between expected and actual refunds could have a material impact on revenues disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
payments for services performed under customer contracts covering a specified time span in the hair restoration centers are originally recorded as deferred revenues 
the earnings process is culminated once the company performs under the terms of the contract 
therefore  revenue is recognized and deferred revenue is reversed on a straight line basis over the course of contract period  which could vary slightly from the actual timing of services performed under the contract 
cost of product used and sold product costs are determined by applying estimated gross profit margins to service and product revenues  which are based on historical factors including product pricing trends and estimated shrinkage 
in addition  the estimated gross profit margin is adjusted based on the results of physical inventory counts performed at least twice a year and the monthly monitoring of factors that could impact our usage rates estimates 
these factors include mix of service sales  discounting and special promotions 
during fiscal year  we performed physical inventory counts in september  february and april may and adjusted our estimated gross profit margin to reflect the results of the observations 
significant changes in product costs  volumes or shrinkage could have a material impact on our gross margin 
self insurance accruals we use a combination of third party insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  health insurance and general liability claims 
the liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheet represents an estimate of the undiscounted ultimate cost of uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from the estimates  self insurance accruals could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
accruals are recorded for such contingencies based on our assessment that the occurrence is probable  and where determinable  an estimate of the liability amount 
management considers many factors in making these assessments including past history and the specifics of each case 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgements 
certain of these estimates and judgements occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
management must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that will not be ultimately recoverable 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which it is determined that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
management recognizes potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when management determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if management s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in the united states  fiscal years and after remain open for federal tax audit 
for state tax audits  the statute of limitations generally spans three to four years  resulting in a number of states remaining open for tax audits dating back to fiscal year internationally including canada  the statute of limitations for tax audits varies by jurisdiction  but generally ranges from three to five years 
results of operations consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information derived from the company s consolidated statement of operations in item  expressed as a percent of revenues 
the percentages are computed as a percent of total revenues  except as noted 
for the years ended june  service revenues product revenues franchise royalties and fees operating expenses cost of service cost of product site operating expenses general and administrative rent depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment operating income income before income taxes net income computed as a percent of service revenues 
computed as a percent of product revenues 
consolidated revenues consolidated revenues primarily include revenues of company owned salons  hair restoration centers  beauty schools  franchise royalties  franchise fees and product and equipment sales to franchisees 
during fiscal year  consolidated revenues increased percent to a record billion 
during fiscal year  consolidated revenues increased percent to billion 
the following table details our consolidated revenues by concept 
all service revenues  product revenues which include product and equipment sales to franchisees  and franchise royalties and fees are included within their respective concept within the table 
for the periods ended june  dollars in thousands north american salons regis mastercuts trade secret smartstyle strip center total north american salons international salons beauty schools hair restoration centers consolidated revenues percent change from prior year salon same store sales increase salon same store sales increases or decreases are calculated on a daily basis as the total change in sales for company owned salons which were open on that specific day of the week during the corresponding prior period 
annual salon same store sales increases are the sum of the same store sales increases computed on a daily basis 
relocated salons are included in same store sales as they are considered to have been open in the prior period 
international same store sales are calculated in local currencies so that foreign currency fluctuations do not impact the calculation 
management believes that same store sales  a component of organic growth  are useful in order to help determine the increase in revenue attributable to its organic growth new salon construction and same store sales growth versus growth from acquisitions 
the and percent increases in consolidated revenues during fiscal year and  respectively  were driven by the following percentage increase decrease in revenues for the years ended june  factor acquisitions previous twelve months organic growth foreign currency closed salons we acquired and company owned salons during the years ended june  and  respectively  including franchise buybacks during fiscal year and during fiscal year additionally  we acquired and six beauty schools in fiscal year and  respectively  and company owned hair restoration centers in fiscal year the organic growth stemmed from the construction of and company owned salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively  as well as consolidated same store sales increases 
during fiscal year and  the foreign currency impact was driven by the weakening of the united states dollar against the british pound  euro and canadian dollar as compared to the prior periods exchange rates 
the impact of foreign currency was calculated by multiplying current year revenues in local currencies by the change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year 
service revenues 
service revenues include revenues generated from company owned salons  tuition and service revenues generated within our beauty schools  and service revenues generated by hair restoration centers 
total service revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands the growth in service revenues in fiscal year and were driven primarily by acquisitions including the acquisition of the hair restoration centers during fiscal year and organic growth in our salons new salon construction and same store sales growth 
during fiscal year and continuing into fiscal year  same store service sales in our salons continued to be modest due to a slight lengthening of customer visitation patterns stemming from a fashion trend towards longer hairstyles 
product revenues 
product revenues are primarily comprised of retail sales at company owned salons  sales of product and equipment to franchisees  and retail product sales made by our beauty schools and hair restoration centers 
total product revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands fiscal year product revenue percentage increases were not as robust as the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower same store product sales increases in our company owned salons 
the large increase in same store product sales during fiscal year was primarily driven by a trend towards sales of higher priced beauty tools  such as flat irons and the introduction of the matrix product line to trade secret salons 
franchise royalties and fees 
total franchise revenues  which include royalties and franchise fees  were as follows increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands total franchise locations open at june  and were  including franchise hair restoration centers and  respectively 
the modest growth in total franchise locations resulted primarily from new salon construction and the acquisition of the hair restoration centers  but was largely offset by franchise buybacks and closures 
we purchased and of our franchise salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
a total of and franchise salons were closed during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations caused consolidated franchise revenues to increase and percent during the years ended june  and  respectively 
exclusive of the effect of this favorable currency fluctuation  consolidated franchise revenues increased and percent in the years ended june  and  respectively 
the fiscal year increase was primarily due to the acquisition of franchise hair restoration centers  as well as opening more new international franchise salons during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  exclusive of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  franchise royalties and fees remained relatively flat as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross margin excluding depreciation our cost of revenues primarily includes labor costs related to salon employees  beauty school instructors and hair restoration center employees  the cost of product used in providing services and the cost of products sold to customers and franchisees 
the resulting gross margin was as follows margin as of total service and product increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  margin revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in total margin as a percent of service and product revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
service margin excluding depreciation 
service margin was as follows service margin as of increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  margin service revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in service margin as a percent of service revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the basis point decrease in service margins during the year ended june  was primarily related to increased payroll taxes and an increased cost of goods used in services during fiscal year the slight basis point decrease in service margins during fiscal year was primarily related to an increase in credit card processing fees and state unemployment taxes  partially offset by improved payroll costs as a percent of service revenues 
product margin excluding depreciation 
product margin for the years ended june    and  was as follows product margin as of increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  margin product revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in product margin as a percent of product revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in product margins for the year ended june  was due to the impact of product sales in the hair restoration centers  which have higher product margins than our salon business 
this favorable impact was softened by an upward adjustment to the usage percentage to reflect current trends towards the sale of lower margin products and an increase to our slow moving product reserve in response to changing product lines 
the fiscal year basis point decrease in product margins was primarily due to the prior fiscal year s favorable physical inventory result stemming from a count performed in the fall of that year  which contributed approximately million to fiscal year reported net income 
the favorable physical inventory result was accounted for as a change in estimate associated with inventory gross profit margins and thus reduced the cost of product sales and was driven primarily by our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers due to our size and volume of purchases 
we subsequently adjusted our cost of goods usage percentages based on the results of this physical inventory 
site operating expenses this expense category includes direct costs incurred by our salons  beauty schools and hair restoration centers  such as on site advertising  workers compensation  insurance  utilities and janitorial costs 
site operating expenses were as follows expense as site of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  operating revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in site operating expenses as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the basis point improvement in site operating expenses during the year ended june  was primarily due to the addition of the hair restoration centers in december  which have lower site operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
during fiscal year  site operating expenses were relatively consistent as a percent of total revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative general and administrative g a includes costs associated with our field supervision  salon training and promotions  product distribution centers and corporate offices such as salaries and professional fees  including costs incurred to support franchise  beauty school and hair restoration center operations 
g a costs were as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  g a revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in g a as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the increase in g a costs as a percent of total revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to the addition of the hair restoration centers  which have slightly higher g a costs as a percent of total revenues due to the marketing intensive nature of that business  as well as increased professional fees related to the june  sarbanes oxley compliance effort and legal fees stemming from a law suit related to the fair labor standards act 
additionally  we identified an issue relating to the potential taxability of certain benefits provided to our employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we established an accrual during our fourth fiscal quarter to address this matter and are currently in the process of resolving this issue 
during fiscal year  g a costs improved as a percent of total consolidated revenues primarily due to salon same store sales increasing at a faster rate than the fixed cost components of g a 
rent rent expense  which includes base and percentage rent  common area maintenance and real estate taxes  was as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  rent revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in rent expense as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the increase in this fixed cost expense as a percent of total revenues was primarily due to rent increasing at a faster rate than salon same store sales during the year ended june  during fiscal year  rent expense remained consistent as a percent of consolidated revenues compared to the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense d a was as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year periods ended june  d a revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the basis point increase in this expense category as a percent of total revenues was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets that we acquired in the acquisition of the hair restoration centers during the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  d a remained relatively consistent as a percent of total consolidated revenues compared to the prior fiscal year 
interest interest expense was as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  interest revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in interest expense as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense as a percent of total revenues during the year ended june  was primarily due to an increase in our debt level stemming from fiscal year acquisition activity  including the hair restoration centers and additional beauty schools 
the fiscal year decrease in interest  and improvement as a percent of total consolidated revenues  stemmed from our strong cash flow and lower outstanding debt balance as a result of the timing of acquisitions 
in addition  the expiration of million of pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of fiscal year contributed to the improvement  as a larger percentage of our total debt was subject to lower short term variable interest rates 
income taxes our reported effective tax rate was as follows effective basis point increase years ended june  rate improvement the increase in our overall effective tax rate for the years ended june  was solely related to the goodwill impairment charge in the international salon segment  which is non deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate improved by basis points during fiscal year  primarily due to the successful settlement of our federal audit and the reinstated work opportunity credit during fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the improvement in our fiscal year overall effective tax rate was also due to a larger percentage of our income being generated in lower rate international tax jurisdictions 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation we compensate some of our salon employees with percentage commissions based on sales they generate  thereby enabling salon payroll expense as a percent of company owned salon revenues to remain relatively constant 
accordingly  this provides us certain protection against inflationary increases  as payroll expense and related benefits our major expense components are variable costs of sales 
in addition  we may increase pricing in our salons to offset any significant increases in wages 
nevertheless  we estimate that we must achieve an annual same store sales increase in excess of two percent to offset the impact of inflationary pressures on fixed costs  such as rent  site operating expenses and general and administrative expenses in order to achieve our long term earning objectives 
constant currency presentation the presentation below demonstrates the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from year to year 
in the years ended june  and  foreign currency translation had a positive impact on total consolidated revenues due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  british pound and euro 
to present this information  current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are converted into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year  rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year 
therefore  the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
for the year ended june  currency constant reported constant currency reported translation currency increase increase amount benefit loss amount decrease decrease dollars in thousands total revenues north american salons international salons beauty schools hair restoration centers total income before income taxes north american salons international salons beauty schools hair restoration centers corporate total for the year ended june  currency constant reported constant currency reported translation currency increase increase amount benefit loss amount decrease decrease dollars in thousands total revenues north american salons international salons beauty schools hair restoration centers total income before income taxes north american salons international salons beauty schools hair restoration centers corporate total represents the percentage increase decrease over reported amounts in the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year primarily general and administrative  corporate depreciation and amortization  and net interest expense results of operations by segment based on our internal management structure  we report four segments north american salons  international salons  beauty schools and hair restoration centers 
significant results of operations are discussed below with respect to each of these segments 
north american salons north american salon revenues 
total north american salon revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year same store years ended june  revenues dollar percentage sales increase dollars in thousands the percentage increases during the years ended june  and were due to the following factors percentage increase decrease in revenues for the years ended june  acquisitions previous twelve months organic growth foreign currency franchise revenues closed salons we acquired and company owned north american salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively  including and franchise buybacks 
the organic growth stemmed primarily from the construction of and company owned salons in north america during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the foreign currency impact during the years ended june  and was driven by the weakening of the united states dollar against the canadian dollar as compared to the prior periods exchange rates 
north american salon operating income 
operating income for the north american salons was as follows operating operating income as increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  income of total revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in north american salon operating income as a percent of total north american salon revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in north american salon operating income during the year ended june  was primarily related to decreased margins stemming from lower vendor rebates due to a decrease in our level of purchases from certain vendors during fiscal year  an upward adjustment to the usage percentage to reflect current trends towards the sale of lower margin products and an increase to our slow moving product reserve in response to changing product lines 
additionally  an adjustment to the weighted average cost associated with our private label product line negatively impacted our product margins in the north american salons 
additionally  rent increased at a faster rate than north american salon same store sales during the year ended june  and payroll taxes were higher as a percent of north american salon revenues than in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in north american salon operating income as a percent of total revenues during the year ended june  was primarily due to an increase in credit card processing fees and state unemployment taxes as compared to the prior fiscal year 
international salons international salon revenues 
total international salon revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year same store years ended june  revenues dollar percentage sales increase dollars in thousands the percentage increases during the years ended june  and were due to the following factors 
percentage increase decrease in revenues for the years ended june  acquisitions previous twelve months organic growth foreign currency franchise revenues closed salons we acquired and company owned international salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the organic growth stemmed from the construction of and company owned international salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively  as well as international same store sales increases 
the same store sales increases in the international salons were not as robust as in the prior years primarily due to slower growth of the european economy over the past two years 
the foreign currency impact during fiscal year and was driven by the weakening of the united states dollar against the british pound and the euro as compared to the prior periods exchange rates 
international salon operating income loss 
operating income loss for the international salons was as follows operating operating income loss as increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  income loss of total revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in international salon operating income loss as a percent of total international salon revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in international salon operating income during the years ended june  was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million during the third quarter of the current fiscal year 
the primary factor that led to the impairment charge was slower than expected growth of the european economy 
exclusive of the goodwill impairment charge  international salon operating income decreased as a percent of international revenues compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher payroll costs including severance payments related to the franchise operations in france  as well as the fixed cost components of g a increasing at a faster rate than the same store sales in the international salons 
the decrease in international salon operating income as a percent of total revenues during the year ended june  was primarily due to an upward adjustment in the cost of goods usage percentage primarily based on a change in the mix of products carried and sold 
beauty schools beauty school revenues 
total beauty schools revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands n a a n a a a we did not own or operate any beauty schools until december of ie  the second quarter of fiscal year 
the percentage increases during the years ended june  and were due to the following factors percentage increase decrease in revenues for the periods ended june  acquisitions previous twelve months organic growth foreign currency we acquired and six beauty schools during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the foreign currency impact during the year ended june  and was driven by the weakening of the united states dollar against the british pound as compared to the prior periods exchange rates 
beauty school operating income 
operating income for our beauty schools was as follows operating operating income as increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  income of total revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands n a a n a a n a a a we did not own or operate any beauty schools until december of ie  the second quarter of fiscal year 
represents the basis point change in beauty school operating income as a percent of total beauty school revenues as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year 
we first began operating beauty schools during december ie  the second quarter of fiscal year  in conjunction with the vidal sassoon acquisition 
we have since expanded by acquiring six beauty schools during fiscal year  and additional schools during fiscal year therefore  the year over year fluctuations in beauty school operating income stem primarily from our integration of the new beauty schools and changes in the mix of beauty schools due to these acquisitions 
hair restoration centers as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired hair club for men and women in december therefore  our operating results for the year ended june  include only seven months of operations from this acquired entity referred to as hair restoration centers for segment reporting purposes 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for the results of operations related to the hair restoration centers which were included in our consolidated statement of operations and note for related pro forma information 
liquidity and capital resources overview we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet to support system growth and financial flexibility 
our debt to capitalization ratio  calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders equity at fiscal year end  was as follows debt to basis point increase fiscal year capitalization improvement the increase in debt over the prior fiscal year was driven by the million acquisition of hair club for men and women with debt during december  as well as over million for the purchase of salons and beauty schools during fiscal year our principal on going cash requirements are to finance construction of new stores  remodel certain existing stores  acquire salons and beauty schools and purchase inventory 
customers pay for salon services and merchandise in cash at the time of sale  which reduces our working capital requirements 
total assets at june  and were as follows total increase over increase over june  assets prior year prior year dollars in thousands acquisitions  including the acquisition of hair club for men and women in december  were primarily funded by a combination of operating cash flows  debt and the assumption of acquired liabilities 
total shareholders equity at june  and was as follows shareholders increase over increase over june  equity prior year prior year dollars in thousands during fiscal year and  equity increased as a result of net income  increased accumulated other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments as the result of the strengthening of foreign currencies that underlie our investments in those markets  and additional paid in capital recorded in connection with the exercise of stock options and stock issued for business acquisitions  partially offset by share repurchases under our stock repurchase program 
cash flows operating activities cash flows from operating activities were a result of the following operating cash flows for the years ended june  dollars in thousands net income depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment accounts payable and accrued expenses tax benefit from employee stock plans inventories deferred income taxes other during fiscal year  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to an increase in inventory  as well as the timing of advertising expenses and income tax payments 
inventories increased due to growth in the number of salons  as well as lower than expected same store product sales 
the goodwill impairment charge resulted from a write off related to the international salon segment 
during fiscal year  deferred income taxes increased primarily due to differences in the book and tax treatment of depreciation and amortization methodologies associated with property and equipment and goodwill

the proceeds from the issuance of common stock were related to the exercise of stock options 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the quarterly dividend was increased from its historical rate of per share to per share 
new financing arrangements fiscal year we acquired hair club for men and women in december for approximately million 
the acquisition was financed with approximately million of debt under our existing revolving credit facility and million of senior term notes issued under an existing agreement  with interest rates ranging from to percent and maturation dates between november and november on april  we entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing revolving credit facility with a syndicate of eight banks 
among other changes  this amendment and restatement increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from million to million  extended the facility s expiration date to april of  reduced the spread charged for certain borrowings under the facility  and modified certain financial covenants 
as so amended  the credit agreement includes financial covenants and other customary terms and conditions for credit facilities of this type 
the amended and restated revolving credit agreement contains several affirmative and negative covenants 
the most restrictive of these is a fixed charge coverage ratio test 
under the terms of the agreement  we may not allow our ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent expense ebitdar to fixed charges which includes rent and interest expenses to drop below on a rolling four quarter basis 
the maturity date for the facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of various events of default  including breaches of the credit agreement  certain cross default situations  certain bankruptcy related situations  and other customary events of default for a facility of this type 
the interest rates under the facility vary and are based on a bank s reference rate  the federal funds rate and or libor  as applicable  and a leverage ratio determined by a formula tied to our debt and adjusted income 
in addition  on april   we issued million of senior unsecured debt to approximately twenty purchasers via a private placement transaction pursuant to a master note purchase agreement 
the placement was split into four tranches  with million maturing march  and million maturing march  of the debt maturing in  million was issued as fixed rate debt with a rate of percent 
the remaining million was issued as variable rate debt and is priced at percent over libor 
as for the million maturing in  million was issued at a fixed rate of percent  with the remaining million issued as variable rate debt  priced at percent over libor 
all four tranches are non amortizing and no principle payments are due until maturity 
interest payments are due semi annually 
the master note purchase agreement includes financial covenants and other customary terms and conditions for debt of this type 
the most restrictive of these is a fixed charge coverage ratio test  as described above 
under the terms of the note purchase agreement  the company may not allow its ratio of ebitdar to fixed charges to drop below on a rolling four quarter basis 
the maturity date for the debt may be accelerated upon the occurrence of various events of default  including breaches of the agreement  certain cross default situations  certain bankruptcy related situations  and other customary events of default for debt of this type 
in anticipation of our new master note purchase agreement discussed above  we entered into a first amendment to note purchase agreement with respect to an existing note purchase agreement dated as of march  we closed on the amendment on april  the amendment modified certain financial covenants so that they would be more consistent with the financial covenants in the new master note purchase agreement 
fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an million term loan related to our salt lake city distribution center 
the loan has a rate of percent and matures in november of fiscal year fiscal year in november  we extended our revolving credit facility through november in february  we renewed one of our private placement debt facilities  thereby extending its terms through october  and increasing its related borrowing capacity from to million 
no other significant changes were made to either of the facilities terms 
there were no other significant financing activities during fiscal year derivative instruments are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and in item a 
of this annual report on form k 
in june  we borrowed million under a percent senior term note due june to repay existing debt from our revolving credit facility 
acquisitions acquisitions are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis in this item  as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these acquisitions relates to the purchase of the hair restoration centers  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for related pro forma information 
the remainder of the acquisitions  individually and in the aggregate  were not material to our operations 
the acquisitions were funded primarily from operating cash flow  debt and the issuance of common stock 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of obligations and commitments outstanding by payment date as of june  within payments due by period more than contractual obligations year years years years total dollars in thousands on balance sheet long term debt obligations capital lease obligations other long term liabilities total on balance sheet off balance sheet a operating lease obligations other long term obligations total off balance sheet total a in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these obligations are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
on balance sheet obligations our long term obligations are composed primarily of senior term notes and a revolving credit facility 
the related interest expected to be paid in relation to these obligations is not included in the table above because of the variable nature of certain interest payments 
additionally  certain senior term notes are hedged by contracts with financial institutions commonly referred to as interest rate swaps  as discussed in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
at june   million of our long term obligations represents the fair value of the adjustments made to mark these hedge contracts to fair value and an additional million represents a deferred gain related to the termination of certain interest rate hedge contracts 
other long term liabilities in the contractual obligations table include a total of million related to a salary deferral program  million related to established contractual payment obligations under retirement and severance payment agreements for a small number of retired employees  million related to the executive profit sharing plan see note and million related to contractual payments required under non compete agreements entered into in conjunction with recent acquisitions 
all amounts exclude amounts deemed to represent interest payments 
this table excludes the short term liabilities  other than the current portion of long term debt  disclosed on our balance sheet as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year 
we have no unconditional purchase obligations  as defined by fas  disclosure of long term obligations 
also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payment estimates associated with employee health and workers compensation claims for which we are self insured 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and workers compensation losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
the company has unfunded deferred compensation contracts covering certain management and executive personnel 
the deferred compensation contracts are offered to key executives based on their accomplishments within the company 
because we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments related to these contracts  such amounts were not included in the table above 
related obligations totaled and million at june  and  respectively  and are included in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases primarily represent long term obligations for the rental of salon  school and hair restoration center premises  including leases for company owned locations  as well as salon franchisee subleases of approximately million  which are funded by franchisees 
regarding the franchisee subleases  we generally retain the right to the related salon assets net of any outstanding obligations in the event of a default by a franchise owner 
management has not experienced and does not expect any material loss to result from these arrangements 
other long term obligations represent our guarantees  primarily entered into prior to december   on a limited number of equipment lease agreements between our salon franchisees and leasing companies 
if the franchisee should fail to make payments in accordance with the lease  we will be held liable under such agreements and retain the right to possess the related salon operations 
we believe the fair value of the salon operations exceeds the maximum potential amount of future lease payments for which we could be held liable 
the existing guaranteed lease obligations  which have an aggregate undiscounted value of million at june   terminate at various dates between june and april the company has not experienced and does not expect any material loss to result from these arrangements 
in certain salon franchise area development agreements  a buyback program was included allowing the franchisee to require us to purchase all of their salon assets within a specified market for percent of their original cost within two years from the date of the franchisee opening their first salon 
as of june   existing franchise salons were covered by such agreements and the related maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments was estimated to be approximately million 
this potential obligation is not included in the table above as the opportunity or the timing of the potential expenditures cannot be reasonably estimated 
we have not and do not expect to incur material expenditures under the buyback program as the program has been discontinued with respect to any new franchise area development agreements and most franchisees who were offered the program in the past choose to continue operating the salons themselves 
further  in the case of a franchisee initiating the buyback program  we anticipate finding another franchisee to purchase the salons directly rather than purchasing them ourselves 
we have interest rate swap contracts  as well as a cross currency swap to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have other unconditional purchase obligations  or significant other commercial commitments such as commitments under lines of credit and standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
we have a standby letter of credit of million related to our self insurance program 
therefore  million of our committed line of credit under our revolving credit facility is restricted 
we are in compliance with all covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and senior notes 
additionally  the credit agreements do not include rating triggers or subjective clauses that would accelerate maturity dates 
as a part of our salon development program  we continue to negotiate and enter into leases and commitments for the acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements related to future salon locations  and continue to enter into transactions to acquire established hair care salons and businesses 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at june  as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
financing financing activities are discussed on pages and in note to the consolidated financial statements  and derivative activities are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management believes that cash generated from operations and amounts available under existing debt facilities will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital expenditures  acquisitions and required debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
as of june   we have available an unused committed line of credit amount of million under our existing revolving credit facility 
this amount excludes million related to a standby letter of credit stemming from our self insurance program 
dividends we paid dividends of per share during fiscal year  per share during fiscal year and per share during fiscal year on august   the board of directors of the company declared a per share quarterly dividend payable september  to shareholders of record on september  share repurchase program in may  the company s board of directors bod approved a stock repurchase program 
originally  the program allowed up to million to be expended for the repurchase of the company s stock 
the bod elected to increase this maximum to million in august  and then to million on may  the timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on many factors  including the market price of the common stock and overall market conditions 
the repurchases to date have been made primarily to eliminate the dilutive effect of shares issued in conjunction with acquisitions and stock option exercises 
as of june   and  a total accumulated  and million shares have been repurchased for  and million  respectively 
all repurchased shares are immediately retired 
this repurchase program has no stated expiration date and at june   million remain to be repurchased under this program 
risk factors impact of acquisition and real estate availablity the key driver of our revenue and earnings growth is the number of salons we acquire or construct 
while we believe that substantial future acquisition and organic growth opportunities exist  any material decrease in the number of such opportunities would have an impact on our revenue and earnings growth 
impact of the economic environment changes to the united states  canadian  united kingdom and other european economies have an impact on our business 
visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by changes in unemployment rates and discretionary income levels 
impact of key relationships we maintain key relationships with certain companies  including wal mart 
termination of these relationships could have an adverse impact on our ability to grow or future operating results 
impact of fashion changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
impact of changes in regulatory and statutory laws with more than  locations and  employees world wide  our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws 
impact of competition competition on a market by market basis remains strong 
therefore  our ability to raise prices in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition 
impact of changes in manufacturers choice of distribution channels the retail products that we sell are licensed to be carried exclusively by professional salons 
should the various product manufacturers decide to utilize other distribution channels  such as large discount retailers  it could negatively impact the revenue earned from product sales 
impact of changes to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates changes in interest rates will have an impact on our expected results from operations 
currently  we manage the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates through the use of variable rate debt instruments and other financial instruments 
see discussion in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional information 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have an impact on our reported results from operations 
the majority of the revenue and costs associated with the performance of our foreign operations are denominated in local currencies such as the canadian dollar  euro and british pound 
therefore  we do not have significant foreign currency transaction risk  however  the translation at different exchange rates from period to period may impact the amount of reported income from our international operations 
refer the constant currency discussion within management s discussion and analysis in the item for a detailed analysis 
impact of seasonality our business is not subject to substantial seasonal variations in demand 
however  the timing of easter may cause a quarterly variation in the third and fourth quarters 
historically  our revenue and net earnings have generally been realized evenly throughout the fiscal year 
the service and retail product revenues associated with our corporate salons  as well as our franchise revenues  are of a replenishment nature 
we estimate that customer visitation patterns are generally consistent throughout the year 
product diversion could have a material adverse impact on our product revenues 
the retail products that we sell are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons 
however  incidents of product diversion occur 
diversion involves the selling of salon exclusive hair care products to discount retailers  and the diverted product is often old  tainted or damaged 
diversion could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products  as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from discount retailers rather than purchasing from one of our salons 
the results of operations from our hair restoration centers may be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate and adapt to rapidly changing technology 
the hair loss industry  including surgical procedures  is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the introduction of new technologies and products could render our current product and service selection obsolete or unmarketable 
we must continually anticipate the emergence of  and adapt our products and services to  new technologies 
failure to comply with extensive regulations could have a material adverse effect on our beauty school business and failure of our beauty school campuses to comply with extensive regulations could result in financial penalties  loss or suspension of federal funding 
a number of our beauty schools students pay tuition and other fees with funds received through student assistance financial aid programs under title iv of the hea 
to participate in such programs  an institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies  accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ed  and certification by the ed 
as a result  our beauty schools are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies 
these regulatory agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one of our beauty schools were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  the regulatory agencies could place limitations on or terminate our beauty schools receipt of federal student financial aid funds  which could have a material adverse effect on our beauty school business  results of operations or financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure of the company relates to changes in interest rates in connection with its debt  some of which bears interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable borrowing margin 
additionally  the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk related to its net investments in its foreign subsidiaries 
the company has established policies and procedures that govern the management of these exposures 
by policy  the company does not enter into such contracts for the purpose of speculation 
the following details the company s policies and use of financial instruments 
interest rate risk the company has established an interest rate management policy that attempts to minimize its overall cost of debt  while taking into consideration the earnings implications associated with the volatility of short term interest rates 
as part of this policy  the company has elected to maintain a combination of variable and fixed rate debt 
considering the company s policy of maintaining variable rate debt instruments  a one percent change in interest rates may impact the company s interest expense by approximately million 
as of june  and  the company had the following outstanding debt balances june  dollars in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt in addition  the company has entered into the following financial instruments interest rate swap contracts the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable rate debt 
on occasion  the company uses interest rate swaps to further mitigate the risk associated with changing interest rates and to maintain its desired balances of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the terms of the interest rate swap agreements contain quarterly settlement dates based on the notional amounts of the swap contracts 
pay fixed rates  receive variable rates the company had an interest rate swap contract that paid fixed rates of interest and received variable rates of interest based on the three month libor rate on notional amounts of indebtedness of million at june   which was accounted for as a cash flow swap 
this swap contract matured during june and  therefore  the company holds no cash flow swaps at the end of fiscal year during fiscal year  the million interest rate swap was redesignated from a hedge of variable rate operating lease obligations to hedge of a portion of the interest payments associated with the company s long term financing program 
the redesignation was the result of the company exercising its right to purchase the property under the variable rate operating lease 
see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
pay variable rates  receive fixed rates the company has interest rate swap contracts that pay variable rates of interest based on the three month and six month libor rates plus a credit spread and receive fixed rates of interest on an aggregate and million notional amount at june  and  respectively  with maturation dates between july and july these swaps were designated as hedges of a portion of the company s senior term notes and are being accounted for as fair value swaps 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company terminated a portion of its million interest rate swap contract  thereby lowering the aggregate notional amount by million 
this remaining notional amount of million was terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to translate the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
different exchange rates from period to period impact the amounts of reported income and the amount of foreign currency translation recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as part of its risk management strategy  the company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations 
as a result  the company may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge assets  liabilities and purchases denominated in foreign currencies
