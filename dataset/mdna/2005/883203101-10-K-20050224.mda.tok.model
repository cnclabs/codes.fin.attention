item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview textron inc is a multi industry company that leverages its global network of businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services in five business segments bell  cessna  fastening systems  industrial and finance 
textron is known around the world for its powerful brands spanning the business jet  aerospace and defense  fastening systems  plastic fuel systems  golf car and turf care markets  among others 
economic conditions improved in  with the majority of our end markets benefiting from the turnaround 
sales volumes in our manufacturing businesses reflected this recovery 
most notably  a steady flow of military orders at bell resulted from increased spending in the defense sector  while cessna saw a significant increase in new business jet orders as a result of improvements in the aircraft sector 
in addition  our finance segment experienced significant improvement in its portfolio credit quality with fewer charge offs and a decrease in nonperforming assets 
textron was  however  affected by commodity inflation in most of its businesses during  including the sharp rise in steel prices which had an million unfavorable impact  primarily in our fastening systems and industrial segments 
as a result of escalating steel prices  we took actions to raise prices and impose surcharges on many of our steel products  primarily in our fastening systems segment  to mitigate the impact of the higher material costs 
while many of these actions were taken in  we believe it will take a few quarters to determine what impact our pricing actions will have on our customers and volumes 
in addition to the higher commodity costs  pension expense increased million 
we were able to absorb the impact of these factors primarily as a result of our transformation strategy through ongoing cost reduction initiatives  lean manufacturing  integrated supply chain and restructuring 
we intend to continue to execute our transformation strategy and strengthen our portfolio through the divestiture of non core businesses and strategic acquisitions to further position textron to take advantage of the improved economic conditions

segment profit represents the measurement used by textron to evaluate performance for decision making purposes 
segment profit for manufacturing segments does not include interest expense  certain corporate expenses  special charges  and gains and losses from the disposition of significant business units 
the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income  interest expense and distributions on preferred securities of finance subsidiary trust  and excludes special charges 
revenues revenues increased million in primarily due to the favorable foreign exchange impact of million  higher volume of million in the manufacturing businesses  the additional revenue of million from the consolidation of citationshares and higher pricing of million 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to lower citation business jet volume of million at cessna  due to a depressed market and the reduction of deliveries by a major fractional jet customer  and lower sales volume of million at e z go and jacobsen  due to a depressed golf market 
these decreases were partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial and fastening systems segments and increased volume of million at kautex 
segment profit segment profit increased million in primarily due to million in cost reduction initiatives  a million benefit from restructuring activities and million of higher pricing 
these increases were partially offset by inflation of million 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to lower profit of million at cessna and million at e z go and jacobsen largely due to lower sales 
these decreases were partially offset by higher profit of million at bell primarily in its aircraft engine and commercial helicopter businesses due to certain costs incurred in  as described in the bell segment section 
special charges special charges are summarized below in millions restructuring unamortized issuance costs on preferred securities gain on sale of c a common stock c a common stock impairment total special charges restructuring program to improve returns at core businesses and to complete the integration of certain acquisitions  textron approved and committed to a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of based upon targeted cost reductions 
this program was expanded in  and in october textron announced a further expansion of the program as part of its strategic effort to improve operating efficiencies  primarily in its industrial businesses 
textron s restructuring program includes corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities primarily in the united states and europe  rationalization of certain product lines  outsourcing of non core production activity  the divestiture of non core businesses  and streamlining of sales and administrative overhead 
under this restructuring program  textron has reduced its workforce by approximately  employees from continuing operations  representing approximately of its global workforce since the restructuring was first announced 
a total of facilities have been closed under this program  including manufacturing plants  primarily in the industrial and fastening systems segments 
in total  textron estimates that the entire program for continuing operations will be approximately million including million related to the divested automotive trim business trim 
as of january   million of cost has been incurred relating to continuing operations including million related to trim  with million in the industrial segment  million in the fastening systems segment  million in the cessna segment  million in the bell segment  million in the finance segment and million at corporate

upon the redemption  million of unamortized issuance costs were written off 
c a common stock during the second half of  the collins aikman corporation common stock owned by textron experienced a decline in market value 
textron acquired this stock as a result of the disposition of the trim business to various operating subsidiaries of collins aikman corporation collectively c a 
in december  moody s investor services moody s lowered its liquidity rating of c a 
due to this indicator and the extended length of time and extent to which the market value of the stock was less than the carrying value  textron determined that the decline in the market value of the stock was other than temporary and wrote down its investment in the stock for a pre tax loss of million 
textron sold its remaining investment in c a common stock for cash proceeds of million and recorded a pre tax gain of million in the first quarter of corporate expenses corporate expenses and other  net increased million in primarily due to nonrecurring income in and increases in certain expenses in the nonrecurring income in included million related to an expired royalty agreement and million in proceeds from life insurance policies 
in  we also experienced higher premiums for directors and officers insurance of million  provided million in funding to textron s charitable trust and had million in higher executive compensation primarily related to improved operating results 
income from continuing operations fluctuations in income from continuing operations are primarily driven by segment profit changes as discussed above 
in addition  textron recorded certain items that affected the comparability of operating results in the last three years which are summarized in the table below in millions special charges gain on sale of businesses income tax benefit on above items gain on sale of businesses includes a gain of million on the sale of textron s remaining interest in an italian automotive joint venture to c a in and a million gain in from transactions related to the divestiture of trim

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during  textron recorded an after tax transitional impairment charge of million upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook we expect a modest increase in revenues in with higher revenue at bell  cessna and finance  while the industrial businesses are expected to be relatively flat 
at bell  the expected revenue increase is primarily related to higher v revenue from new production releases recorded on an as delivered basis  which is expected to more than offset lower engineering and development based revenues recorded on a cost incurred basis 
at cessna  we expect an increase in revenue due to higher sales of jets based on our current backlog 
overall segment profit and margins are expected to increase as textron continues to realize the benefits of its cost reduction initiatives and substantially completed restructuring program 
textron s commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was billion and billion at the end of and  respectively  and is primarily related to cessna 
us government backlog was billion and billion at the end of and  respectively  which was substantially all in the bell segment

bell helicopter has two major programs with the us government the v and the h upgrade program 
the v is the pioneer program for tiltrotor technology with a current requirement of aircraft 
bell expects to receive authorization to proceed to full rate production of the v in the h upgrade program is a major contract to remanufacture the us marine corps fleet of ah w supercobra and uh n utility helicopters to an advanced configuration featuring common avionics and flight dynamics 
bell expects to receive authorization to proceed to full rate production in for uh n and ah w helicopters 
bell currently has orders for six uh y aircraft and three ah z aircraft  and expects to begin deliveries in bell helicopter continues to manufacture aircraft under the v low rate initial production releases that began prior to revenues under those releases are recorded on a cost incurred basis primarily as a result of the significant engineering effort required over a lengthy period of time during the initial development phase in relation to total contract volume 
revenues for those releases are expected to decline through as the remaining effort is completed 
the development effort was substantially complete for new production releases in  and revenue on those releases will be recognized as units are delivered  which is expected to begin in accordingly  during  v program revenues related to new production releases recorded on an as delivered basis are expected to more than offset lower revenues associated with the diminishing development revenues recorded as costs are incurred 
during  bell helicopter s commercial business rebounded with increases in orders  deliveries and backlog 
bell continued to invest in commercial programs as evidenced by the significant progress made on the newly announced light twin aircraft and other program upgrades in response to customer requests to improve speed  lower operating costs and reduce noise 
in december  the bell agusta aerospace company  llc received llc federal aviation administration certification of the ab helicopter 
additionally  textron systems has received orders to deliver over armored security vehicles asv in with additional orders expected 
currently  production capacity is ramping up to meet these deliveries 
bell revenues the bell segment s revenues decreased million in  compared with  due to lower revenue of million in the us government business  partially offset by higher commercial sales of million 
us government sales decreased primarily due to lower revenue of million on the v program and lower sales of million related to a contract for training aircraft completed in in addition  revenue was reduced by million related to a final agreement with the us government to settle an overhead cost rate matter 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by million of higher military spares volume  increased sales of million for air launched weapons and higher h revenue of million 
commercial revenues increased primarily due to higher foreign military sales of million  increased volume in the aircraft engine business of million and higher spares volume of million 
these increases were partially offset by lower huey ii kit sales of million and lower sales of commercial aircraft of million 
the lower v revenue was primarily due to lower effort of million on production lots three through six as these contracts near completion and decreasing development activities of million 
the bell segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  due to higher us government revenue of million primarily due to the ongoing development efforts on the v program and higher foreign military sales volume of million related to a contract that began shipments during the third quarter of bell segment profit segment profit increased million in  compared with  due to higher profit of million in the commercial business  partially offset by the impact of lower revenue of million in the us government business 
commercial profit increased primarily due to the million impact of the higher foreign military sales  favorable cost performance in the commercial helicopter business of million including the favorable resolution of a million warranty issue provided for in  the million benefit from a favorable mix of commercial aircraft and the million favorable impact of a nonrecurring charge related to a recall  inspection and customer care program at the aircraft engine business  partially offset by higher engineering expenses of million 
profit in the us government business decreased primarily due to the million impact of lower v revenue  an million settlement with the us government and lower volume of training aircraft of million  partially offset by the million impact of higher volume of air launched weapons 
segment profit in was million greater than in primarily because included million of costs related to the recall  inspection and customer care programs at the aircraft engine business and higher profit of million in the commercial helicopter business 
the higher profit in the commercial helicopter business in was primarily due to lower receivable reserve provisions of million and reduced pricing of million in related to one commercial helicopter model 
bell outlook bell s revenues are expected to increase about in largely due to higher v and asv deliveries 
v revenue is expected to increase as deliveries of new production releases recorded on an as delivered basis are expected to more than offset lower engineering and development based revenues recorded on a cost incurred basis 
margins are expected to remain relatively consistent as a result of ramp up costs for v production 
cessna dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog cessna is a leading manufacturer of general aviation aircraft and the largest manufacturer of light and mid sized business jets 
cessna provides dependable aircraft and premier service to corporate customers in over countries 
cessna also participates in the fractional jet ownership business through its sales to a major fractional jet customer  as well as through citationshares  textron s joint venture with tag aviation usa  inc during  the economy strengthened after a prolonged downturn  leading to a significant increase in business jet and single engine aircraft orders 
at the same time  cessna also realized the benefit of its continued strategy of investment in new product development  receiving faa certification for the citation xls  sovereign and cj business jets and introducing upgrades to the cj and cj  the cj and the cj 
cessna revenues the cessna segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due the million increase from the consolidation of citationshares  million of higher pricing and a million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances 
citation business revenue jet deliveries were in  compared with jets in the cessna segment s revenues decreased million in  compared with  due to lower citation business jet volume revenue jet deliveries in  compared with in 
lower used aircraft volume of million and lower caravan volume of million as a result of lower demand were essentially offset by higher spare parts and service volume of million  higher pricing of million related to the last remnants of introductory pricing on certain business jet models and a million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances 
cessna segment profit segment profit increased million in  compared with  largely due to million of improved cost performance  million of higher pricing  million of lower used aircraft valuation adjustments  a million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and an million benefit related to the expiration of prior year residual value guarantees  partially offset by million of inflation and the unfavorable impact of lower business jet volume and unfavorable mix of million 
the benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and valuation adjustments was primarily due to fewer trade ins and a stabilization in market values for used jets in segment profit decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to reduced margin of million from lower sales volume and inflation of million  partially offset by improved cost performance of million and higher pricing of million related to the last remnants of introductory pricing on certain business jet models and a million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances 
cessna outlook we expect cessna s revenues to increase in due to higher sales of jets based on our current backlog 
margins are also expected to increase primarily as a result of the higher business jet volume 
cessna plans to continue its investment in new products such as the cj  cj and mustang  broadening its product line to take advantage of the improving business jet market 
fastening systems dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin textron fastening systems is one of the world s largest providers of integrated fastening systems solutions and offers a full range of fastening technologies  including fasteners  engineered assemblies and automation equipment 
major markets served include aerospace  automotive  computer  construction  electronics  electrical equipment  industrial equipment  non automotive transportation  telecommunications and white good markets 
these markets are highly competitive  and suppliers are often required to make price concessions to win new business and maintain existing customers 
consequently  significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions  but also to improve margins 
during  an increase in the global demand for steel resulted in significantly higher prices for materials used in the manufacturing process at fastening systems  a major supplier of steel fasteners 
as a result  fastening systems took action to raise prices and impose surcharges on its steel products to mitigate the impact of higher raw material costs 
there has been about a six month lag between the increases in cost and full implementation of the new customer pricing programs 
these price increases for steel have been partially offset by price concessions required to win new business and retain existing customers 
fastening systems revenues the fastening systems segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to favorable foreign exchange of million  higher volume of million  largely due to improvements in many of its end markets  and million of higher pricing 
the fastening systems segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of million  reflecting a weak us dollar  partially offset by higher pricing concessions of million in and lower volume primarily in the european industrial markets 
fastening systems segment profit segment profit decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to inflation of million  partially offset by improved cost performance of million  pricing of million  the impact of the higher sales volume of million and favorable foreign exchange of million 
inflation includes million of higher steel prices  which were partially offset by million in price increases and surcharges to customers 
segment profit in remained relatively flat with some deterioration  compared with  reflecting the soft demand for the segment s products and higher pricing concessions of million 
fastening systems outlook we expect revenues at fastening systems will remain relatively flat in with a slight improvement in profit margin as we begin to realize the full benefit of our substantially completed restructuring program and other process improvements 
industrial dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin the industrial segment is composed of five businesses  including e z go  jacobsen  kautex  greenlee and fluid power 
through these businesses  the segment provides its customers with innovative solutions and services  including golf cars and turf care equipment  plastic fuel systems  wire and cable installation equipment  and industrial pumps and gears 
these markets are highly competitive and price sensitive 
consequently  significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions but also to improve margins 
industrial revenues the industrial segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of million and higher sales volume of million  partially offset by million related to the divestiture of a non core product line during the second quarter of the higher sales volume primarily reflects an increase of million at kautex  largely due to new product launches and growth in its international markets  and to a lesser degree increases of million and million at e z go and jacobsen  respectively 
the industrial segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of million and higher sales volume of million at kautex as a result of new product launches and a continued strong automotive market 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of million at e z go and jacobsen  reflecting reduced demand that was largely attributable to a depressed golf market 
industrial segment profit segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to million of improved cost performance  improved credit performance of million  the favorable foreign exchange impact of million  the million impact of higher volume and lower fair market value adjustments of million for used golf cars 
these increases were partially offset by inflation of million and lower profit of million at a north american kautex plant due to increased costs from manufacturing inefficiencies 
segment profit decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to lower profit of million at e z go and jacobsen  due to lower sales as a result of the depressed golf market  the impact of adjusting production schedules to the lower demand and million in higher bad debt provisions as a result of a financially weakened customer base 
this decrease was partially offset by million related to improved results in each of the other businesses primarily as a result of improved cost performance 
industrial outlook industrial revenues are expected to remain flat in  with slightly lower revenues at kautex  as a result of model changeovers  expected to be offset with modest growth in the remaining businesses 
segment margins are forecasted to increase to about  as the segment continues to realize the benefit of its substantially completed restructuring program and other process improvements 
finance dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin the finance segment is a diversified commercial finance business with core operations in aircraft finance  asset based lending  distribution finance  golf finance  resort finance and structured capital 
its financing activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and leasing to commercial markets 
within these core operations  this segment also provides financing programs for products manufactured by textron 
in  management continued its focus on growing its core business while liquidating non core assets 
finance revenues the finance segment s revenues decreased million in  compared with the decrease was primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of million  largely due to the continued liquidation of non core assets resulting in lower average finance receivables of million  and a reduction of discount earnings in the distribution finance business 
the decrease was partially offset by higher securitization gains of million  primarily due to improved yield  and million from an increase in average finance receivables sold to the distribution finance revolving conduit  partially offset by a million reduction in resort finance gains 
the finance segment s revenues decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of million from lower average finance receivables and a decline in syndication income due to a nonrecurring gain in of million on the sale of a franchise finance portfolio 
finance segment profit segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses  reflecting an improvement in portfolio quality  partially offset by lower net interest margin of million 
segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a lower provision for loan losses of million million in vs 
million in  partially offset by higher operating expense of million 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses reflects an improvement in portfolio quality as measured by improvements in nonperforming assets as discussed below and  to a lesser extent  declining portfolio growth 
the higher operating expense includes million in higher legal and collection expense primarily related to the continued resolution of nonperforming accounts and the accrual of settlement costs associated with litigation during finance portfolio quality the following table presents information about the credit quality of the finance segment s portfolio in millions  except for ratios provision for loan losses nonperforming assets ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets allowance for losses on finance receivables recorded on balance sheet ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables net charge offs days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables during the last two years  the finance segment has experienced improvements in portfolio quality as indicated by improved credit quality measures and a lower provision for losses 
the improvements in credit quality were evident through lower nonperforming asset levels and days contractual delinquency 
textron finance s nonperforming assets include nonaccrual accounts that are not guaranteed by textron manufacturing  for which interest has been suspended  and repossessed assets 
nonperforming assets for each of the last three year ends by business are as follows in millions resort finance aircraft finance golf finance distribution finance asset based lending other total nonperforming assets we believe that nonperforming assets will generally be in the range of to of finance assets depending on economic conditions 
textron finance experienced significant improvement in total nonperforming assets with a million decrease in and a million decrease in the decrease in was primarily attributable to the core businesses  including million in aircraft finance and million in distribution finance  largely related to improved general economic conditions 
excluding an increase of million in nonperforming assets related to one customer within its golf mortgage portfolio  the golf finance business experienced improvements of million in its golf mortgage portfolio and million in its golf equipment finance portfolio 
the non core businesses within the other line continued to decrease with a million reduction in telecommunications  million in media finance and million in other liquidating portfolios  partially offset by a million increase in franchise finance primarily related to one customer 
these non core businesses continue to compose a disproportionate amount of textron finance s nonperforming assets accounting for of total nonperforming assets  while composing only of the total finance assets at january  overall  we expect continued modest improvement as these portfolios liquidate 
finance outlook in  we expect the finance segment s profit to increase primarily as a result of improved interest margin due to higher average finance receivables and lower relative borrowing costs

this framework is designed to enhance textron s borrowing power by separating the finance segment 
textron manufacturing consists of textron inc  the parent company  consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell  cessna  fastening systems and industrial business segments  whose financial results are a reflection of the ability to manage and finance the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services 
textron finance consists of textron s wholly owned commercial finance subsidiary  textron financial corporation  consolidated with its subsidiaries 
the financial results of textron finance are a reflection of its ability to provide financial services in a competitive marketplace  at appropriate pricing  while managing the associated financial risks 
the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities result in different measures used by investors  rating agencies and analysts 
a portion of textron finance s business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by textron manufacturing s bell  cessna and industrial segments 
the cash flows related to these captive financing activities are reflected as operating activities by textron manufacturing and as investing activities by textron finance based on each group s operations 
these captive financing transactions have been eliminated and cash from customers or from securitizations is recognized in operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows when received 
textron inc provides a support agreement to textron finance that requires textron inc to maintain ownership of textron finance 
the agreement also requires textron finance to maintain fixed charge coverage of no less than and consolidated shareholder s equity of no less than million 
textron finance s bank agreements prohibit the termination of the support agreement 
textron s financial position continued to be strong at the end of and included cash and cash equivalents of million  compared with million at the end of during  cash flows from operations were the primary source of funds for the operating needs  restructuring activities  dividends and capital expenditures 
management analyzes operating cash flows for textron manufacturing by tracking free cash flow  which is calculated using net cash provided by operating activities  adding back after tax cash used for restructuring activities and proceeds on the sale of fixed assets  then subtracting capital expenditures  including those financed with capital leases 
operating cash flows in millions consolidated textron manufacturing textron finance on a consolidated basis  operating cash flows have remained fairly consistent over the past two years 
textron manufacturing s operating cash flows have increased significantly over the past two years  reflecting improved operating performance and enterprise management initiatives 
the million increase in textron manufacturing s operating cash flows is largely due to a decrease in working capital of million in  compared with a million increase in working capital in a significant portion of this decrease was due to an increase in customer deposits in the bell and cessna segments largely due to an increase in orders for jets and commercial helicopters 
textron manufacturing s operating cash flows include after tax cash used to finance textron s restructuring program totaling million in  million in and million in operating cash flows in included a million tax refund received in investing cash flows in millions consolidated textron manufacturing textron finance on a consolidated basis  investing cash flows are largely driven by textron finance 
textron finance increased its use of cash for investing activities primarily due to a million decrease in proceeds from the sale of finance receivables and securitizations and a million increase in finance receivable originations  net of repayments 
the reduction in proceeds from receivable sales was largely attributable to the sale of a small ticket equipment portfolio in for million  a million increase in the utilization of the distribution finance conduit and franchise portfolio sales of million in the significant increase in was primarily due to a million decrease in finance receivable originations  net of repayments  million in higher proceeds from finance receivable sales and a nonrecurring million repayment in of an advance made to textron manufacturing 
excluding the nonrecurring repayment in of an advance of million from textron finance  textron manufacturing s use of cash for investing activities has been fairly consistent and is largely driven by capital expenditures

within the consolidated statement of cash flows these amounts have been eliminated from investing activities and are recorded as a net amount in operating cash flows under the caption captive finance receivables  net 
financing cash flows in millions consolidated textron manufacturing textron finance on a consolidated basis  the changes in financing cash flows over the past few years are largely driven by changes in the cash flows for textron finance 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in at textron finance is primarily due to a net increase in commercial paper and other short term debt to fund asset growth 
the cash used in primarily relates to the pay down of commercial paper and other short term debt from the proceeds received from finance receivable sales 
in addition  in  under new and existing shelf registration statements  textron finance issued billion of term notes  primarily in us and canadian markets

capital resources textron manufacturing s debt net of cash to total capital ratio as of january  was  compared with at january  textron manufacturing has established a long term debt to capital ratio target in the mid thirties 
consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community  leverage of the manufacturing operations excludes the debt of textron finance 
in turn  textron finance limits its borrowings to an amount  taking into account the risk profile of its assets  consistent with a single a credit rating 
surplus capital of textron finance is returned to textron inc borrowings have historically been a secondary source of funds for textron manufacturing and  along with the collection of finance receivables  are a primary source of funds for textron finance 
both textron manufacturing and textron finance utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs 
our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flow and satisfy certain financial ratios 
since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost  we target a long term a rating from the independent debt rating agencies 
as of january   our credit ratings are as follows fitch moody s standard poor s long term textron manufacturing a a a textron finance a a a short term textron manufacturing f p a textron finance f p a for liquidity purposes  textron manufacturing and textron finance have a policy of maintaining sufficient unused lines of credit to support their outstanding commercial paper

actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
textron also expects to make contributions to its funded pension plans in the range of million to million per year over the next five years  which are not reflected in this table 
other long term liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which textron is committed to purchase goods and services as of january  textron s ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 
effective january   textron engaged a third party service provider to assume oversight of its information technology infrastructure  including maintenance  operational oversight and purchases of hardware the it contract 
the it contract covers a ten year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications 
textron retains the right to approve significant design  equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider 
textron has the ability to terminate the it contract prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed million in the following table summarizes textron finance s known contractual obligations to make future payments 
due to the nature of finance companies  textron finance also has contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future 
textron finance generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables 
the contractual payments and receipts as of january  are detailed below payment due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total textron finance contractual payments commercial paper and other short term debt term debt operating leases total contractual payments contractual receipts finance receivables operating leases total contractual receipts cash total cash and contractual receipts net cash and contractual receipts payments cumulative net cash and contractual receipts payments finance receivables are based on contractual cash flows 
these amounts could differ due to prepayments  charge offs and other factors 
contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges and discounts from receivables  debt interest payments  proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 
as shown in the preceding table  cash collections from finance assets are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities 
at january   textron finance had billion in debt and million in other liabilities that are payable within the next twelve months 
at january   textron finance had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under billion of committed revolving lines of credit  compared with billion at january  the decrease is largely related to the continued liquidation of the non core syndicated bank loan portfolio in since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements textron has certain ventures where we have guaranteed debt up to an aggregate amount of approximately million 
textron also has other guarantee arrangements as more fully discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
bell helicopter has partnered with the boeing company in the development of the v tiltrotor  with agusta aerospace corporation in the development of the ab and ba  and with agustawestland north america inc awna in the development of the us these agreements enable us to share expertise and costs  and ultimately the profits  with our partners 
bell and awna formed the agustawestlandbell limited liability company awb llc for the joint design  development  manufacture  sale  customer training and product support of the us helicopter 
lockheed martin  with awb llc as its principal subcontractor  has been selected to design  develop  manufacture and support the presidential helicopter for the us marine corps marine helicopter squadron vxx program 
bell helicopter has guaranteed to lockheed martin of the performance of awb llc under subcontracts received by awb llc from lockheed martin as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
textron manufacturing enters into a forward contract in textron common stock on an annual basis 
the contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock based incentive compensation indexed to textron stock 
the forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counter parties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing textron common stock price 
as of january   the contract was for approximately million shares with a strike price of 
the market price of the stock was at january   resulting in a receivable of million  compared with a receivable of million at january  textron finance sells finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and whole loan sales 
as a result of these transactions  finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet  and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels 
despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position  textron finance generally retains a subordinate interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations  which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments 
these retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
textron finance utilizes these off balance sheet financing arrangements primarily asset backed securitizations to further diversify funding alternatives 
these arrangements are an important source of funding that provided net proceeds from continuing operations of million and million in and  respectively 
textron finance has used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper 
whole loan finance receivable sales in which textron finance maintains a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred 
limited credit enhancement is typically provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and  to a lesser extent  prepayment risk 
textron finance has a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease rental streams in and the maximum liability at january  was million  and in the event textron finance s credit rating falls below bbb  it is required to pledge a related pool of equipment residuals that amount to million 
textron finance has valued this contingent liability based on assumptions for annual credit losses and prepayment rates of and  respectively 
an instantaneous adverse change in these rates would have an insignificant impact on the valuation of this contingent liability 
termination of textron finance s off balance sheet financing arrangements would significantly reduce its short term funding alternatives 
while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require textron finance to repurchase significant balances of receivables previously sold  there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future 
potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality  downgrades in textron finance s debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements 
textron finance does not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on its liquidity or income from continuing operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of textron s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties  are listed below 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
receivable and inventory reserves we evaluate the collectibility of our commercial and finance receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its short term financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  geographic economic conditions  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts for amounts we estimate to be potentially uncollectible 
receivables are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
for homogeneous loan pools and all other receivables  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on current delinquencies  the characteristics of the existing accounts  historical loss experience  the value of underlying collateral  and general economic conditions and trends 
finance receivables are written down to the fair value less estimated costs to sell of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months  unless we deem the receivable collectible 
reserves on certain finance receivables are determined using estimates of related collateral values based on historical recovery rates and current market conditions 
management reviews the market conditions for used equipment and aircraft inventories on a periodic basis 
a deterioration in market conditions resulting in lower recovery rates would result in lower estimated collateral values  increasing the amount of reserves required on related receivables and used inventories on hand 
based on current market conditions and recovery rates  we believe our reserves are adequate as of january  long term contracts we recognize revenue and profit as work on certain government long term engineering  development and production contracts progresses using the contract method of accounting  which relies on estimates of the total contract cost and revenue 
estimated contract cost and revenue are based on current contract specifications  expected engineering requirements and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires substantial judgments 
the cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in net earnings when determinable 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition  while unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized earnings 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
earnings on long term contracts could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to income if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using the estimates from our long term strategic plans 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
securitized transactions securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts 
while the assets sold are no longer on our balance sheet  our retained interests are included in other assets 
we may retain an interest in the transferred assets in the form of interest only securities  subordinated certificates  cash reserve accounts  and servicing rights and obligations 
our retained interests are subordinate to other investors interests in the securitizations 
generally  we do not provide legal recourse to third party investors that purchase interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained interest only securities  subordinated certificates and cash reserve accounts 
however  textron manufacturing has provided a guarantee on a limited basis to a certain securitization trust sponsored by a third party financial institution that purchases timeshare note receivables from textron finance  as discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future cash flows expected using our best estimates of credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
these assumptions are reviewed each quarter  and the retained interests are written down when the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on revised estimates and the decline is estimated to be other than temporary 
based on our sensitivity analysis  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  a adverse change in either the prepayment speed  expected credit losses or the residual cash flows discount rate would not result in a material charge to income 
pension and other postretirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  we have reduced the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense to from in while historical rates have exceeded  the expected long term rate of return assumption was lowered to reflect the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets 
our qualified domestic plans compose over of our total pension obligations 
in  the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans was 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a million increase in pension expense 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits and changes as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  we decreased our weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense to in from in for our qualified domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was for a basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a million increase in pension expense 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at january  as a result of a reduction in the discount rate and changes in foreign exchange rates which more than offset the favorable impact of strong pension asset returns and the contributions made by us during accordingly  we recorded a non cash adjustment to shareholders equity for the minimum pension liability of million  net of income taxes  in the fourth quarter of the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the healthcare cost trend rate  which is the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  was 
this rate is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognized future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to measure compensation costs for share based payments to employees  including stock options  at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
textron is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  companies must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
management is evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
management believes the impact of adopting sfas rwill result in additional expense of approximately million  net of income taxes  for this estimate is subject to change based on a number of factors  including the actual number of stock option awards granted  changes in assumptions underlying the option value estimates  such as the risk free interest rate  and tax deductions for employee disqualifying dispositions  if any 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risks textron s financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  textron enters into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa 
the overall objective of textron s interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt 
textron s mix of floating and fixed rate debt is continuously monitored by management and is adjusted  as necessary  based on evaluation of internal and external factors 
the difference between the rates textron manufacturing received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in  or within its finance segment  textron s strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities limits its risk to changes in interest rates 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at january   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were million  net of billion of interest rate exchange agreements on fixed rate long term debt and million of interest rate exchange agreements on fixed rate finance receivables 
for textron finance  interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risks textron s financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold 
for  the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from increased revenues by approximately million and increased segment profit by approximately million textron manufacturing manages its exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency and  as such  certain exposures are naturally offset 
during  textron manufacturing primarily used borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in addition  as part of managing its foreign currency transaction exposures  textron manufacturing enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts are generally used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts  foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately million at the end of and million at the end of quantitative risk measures textron utilizes a sensitivity analysis to quantify the market risk inherent in its financial instruments 
financial instruments held by textron that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements  foreign exchange contracts  marketable equity securities and marketable security price forward contracts 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of textron s financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading at year end 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments at year end assuming a decrease in interest rates  a strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a decrease in the quoted market prices of applicable marketable equity securities 
the estimated fair value of the financial instruments was determined by discounted cash flow analysis and by independent investment bankers 
this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future
