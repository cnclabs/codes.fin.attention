item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we base these statements on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market advanced technical ceramic products  ceramic powders and components for defense  industrial  automotive diesel and commercial applications 
our primary products include lightweight ceramic armor for soldiers and military helicopters  ceramic orthodontic brackets  ceramic diesel engine components  various types of ceramic powders  evaporation boats  functional coatings  ceramic impregnated dispenser cathodes for microwave tubes  lasers and cathode ray tubes  and ceramic industrial components for erosion and corrosion resistant applications 
our customers include the us government  prime government contractors and large industrial and commercial manufacturers 
we conduct our operations primarily through four segments 
the following table includes a summary of our products by applications for our four segments

the table below shows the percentage contribution to our total sales of each market application in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial automotive diesel commercial total the principal factors contributing to our recent growth in sales is increased demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers and our acquisition of esk ceramics in esk s reported sales are million since the inclusion of their results as of september  recent military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq  as well as an increasingly unstable geopolitical climate and the heightened risk of international conflicts  have resulted in increased orders for ceramic body armor 
we expect our shipments of ceramic body armor to be higher in fiscal year than in however  unless we receive additional orders under existing contracts or are successful in obtaining new contracts for ceramic body armor  our shipments of ceramic body armor will decline materially in from levels we expect to achieve in for the next several quarters  and perhaps longer  fluctuations in sales of ceramic body armor are likely to be the biggest factor affecting our sales 
although we expect demand for ceramic body armor to continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget appropriations and the level of international conflicts 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on our ability to successfully compete for this business 
other existing products which we believe could have a significant impact on our growth over the long term include ceramic components for heavy duty diesel truck engines and ceramic radomes nose cones for missiles 
in recent years  a substantial portion of our annual revenue has been derived from our order backlog as of the end of the preceding year 
our order backlog as of december  was approximately million  and we had  of unexercised options for orders 
as of december   we had backlog of approximately million  and million of unexercised options for orders 
orders for ceramic armor as of december  represented approximately million  or of the total backlog 
this compares with orders for ceramic armor as of december  of approximately million  or of the total backlog at that time 
we expect that substantially all of the firm scheduled orders as of december  will be shipped during our sales to customers located outside of the united states have varied  representing million  or of net sales in  million  or in  and million  or in as a result of our acquisition of esk ceramics in august  our sales to customers located outside of the united states as a percentage of total sales increased substantially 
esk s sales to customers located outside of the united states were million  or of the total million export sales for us 
we plan to increase our sales efforts in foreign countries  and our acquisition of esk ceramics will help us achieve this goal 
we currently have sales offices in germany  china  and england as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
of our export sales  were denominated in us dollars 
net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products  which we recognize when the product is shipped to the customer 
in the past  we have also received research and development funds from the us government under small business innovation research grants 
these research and development funds  which have been relatively small in amount  have been recognized as revenue as we performed the research and development 

table of contents cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses  which we also include in cost of product sales and expense as incurred 
energy costs are an integral and material cost of our product sales 
for the year ended december  electricity energy costs for us in the united states and europe in connection with our manufacturing operations were million  an increase of million  or  from million of electricity energy costs in the prior year 
electricity energy consumed for the year ended december  was million kilowatt hours  an increase of million kilowatt hours  or  from million kilowatt hours in the prior year 
average costs per kilowatt hour for the year ended december  were  an increase of 
per kilowatt hour  or  compared to 
in the prior year 
for the year ended december  natural gas and propane energy costs were  an increase of  or  from  of natural gas and propane energy costs in the prior year 
natural gas and propane energy consumed in connection with the manufacturing operations for the year ended december  were  therms  an increase of  therms  or  from  therms in the prior year 
the average costs of a therm for the year ended december  was  an increase of 
per therm  or  compared to in the prior year 
we recently relocated part of our silicon nitride manufacturing operations from california to a new facility in lexington  kentucky because of lower energy and occupancy costs in kentucky compared to california 
recently  the company increased its manufacturing capacity for the production of body armor plates by adding a hot press line at this facility 
we chose this facility for the location of the hot press expansion for the same reasons lower costs of energy and occupancy 
selling expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response to customer requirements  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred

the effective income tax rate was also in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this form k 

table of contents in applying these policies  estimates and judgments affect the amounts at which accounts receivable and inventory and certain liabilities are recorded and the useful lives of property and equipment 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments 
future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
future changes could also affect the estimated useful levels of property and equipment  which could result in changes in depreciation expense or write offs or write downs of such assets 
sales recognition 
sales are recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company reduces revenue with reserves for estimated price concessions and sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  are based upon historical price concessions and sales returns 
the company does not record a warranty reserve on the sale of its products 
for its largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and the company 
for its non body armor sales  the company has experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes our estimate of the amount we expect to be uncollectable on specific accounts and unidentified accounts included in accounts receivable 
in estimating the potential losses on specific accounts  we rely on in house prepared analysis  historical experience and a review of other available information 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
warranty reserve 
the us government defense logistics agency dla notified us on march   that three lots of our small arms protective inserts sapi for light weight ceramic armor shipped in january failed to pass ballistics reverification tests by the government s designated independent commercial testing laboratory 
during the period of december through march   we had shipped approximately million under our existing contract with the dla 
subsequent to march   the dla directed the independent testing laboratory to perform reverification testing and million of the shipments were not in testing compliance 
when we first were notified of these issues on march   we voluntarily stopped producing our original sapi design and thereafter actively worked with the government to understand the quality and testing issues and to resolve the status and disposition of the sapi plates in question 
we completed the development of a modified design for our ceramic sapi armor plates 
independently performed tests by the government s designated testing laboratory of the modified design have been successful and the first article initial production parts of this modified design was approved in june on august   we signed an amendment to our contract with the government for certain of the sapi plates shipped in december and the first quarter the amendment required that we correct or replace at our expense all supplies of the product that did not meet the original contractual requirements 
the warranty items were delivered between october and june we estimated the cost to rework and upgrade the sapi plates at approximately  and set up a warranty reserve in that amount  recorded in the second quarter ended june  against cost of product sales 
upon completion of the cost to rework and upgrade the sapi plates during the second quarter ended june   there was a remaining warranty reserve amount of  that was credited to cost of product sales 

table of contents changes in the product warranty accrual for the year ended december  were as follows warranty accrual  january  warranty expenditures remaining balance credited to cost of product sales warranty accrual  december  normally  we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  a revised testing and acceptance procedure was instituted in as a result of the warranty claim described above 
each lot of body armor is now tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program  which includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe that a warranty reserve is necessary 
liquidity and capital resources we generally have met our operating and capital requirements with cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our term loan and line of credit  and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
our net cash position decreased by million during the year ended december   compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to million 
the primary factors contributing to cash flow from operating activities were net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a million reduction of income taxes payable due to the exercise of stock options  and increased levels of accounts payable  accrued expenses and income tax payable that added an aggregate of million 
these contributions were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable of million due to higher amounts of sales over the previous year  and increased levels of inventories  production tooling and prepaid expenses that totaled million 
cash used in investing activities of million was for acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired of million  capital expenditures of million  offset by redemptions of million of marketable securities 
a majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment to gain additional capacity and improve operations 
also included in the total capital expenditures was million used to install a new hot press line and furnaces for the production of ceramic armor plates in lexington  kentucky that was partially complete at december  we estimate that we will spend another million to complete it in also included in total capital expenditures was million used to expand and improve our hot press line and furnaces in costa mesa  california and million to install new machinery  equipment and furnaces in lexington  kentucky 
financing activities provided cash of million  generated primarily from the net proceeds of million borrowed from our million credit facility 
on august   we entered into a million credit facility agreement with wachovia bank  national association  and a syndicate of banks and other institutional lenders 
the obligations under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  other than real property 
the credit agreement provides for a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving line of credit in the amount of million 
we borrowed the entire million under the term loan on august  principal under the term loan is payable in installments of  on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing december   with a balloon payment of  payable on august  additional payments of principal are required annually in an amount equal to of our excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
principal may be prepaid at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty at our election 
accrued interest is payable with each installment of principal 
as of december   the balance due under our term loan was million 
the interest rate on million of the million term loan is currently based on the libor rate for a fixed period of six months  at an effective interest rate equal to percent per annum 
the interest rate on the million balance is comprised of a million amount based on the libor rate for a fixed period of three months  at an effective interest rate equal to percent per annum and a million amount based on the libor rate for a fixed period of approximately two months  at an effective interest rate equal to percent per annum 

table of contents as of december   we borrowed a total of million under the revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on million of the credit line is based on the us libor rate for a period of one month  at an effective rate equal to 
the interest rate on million of the credit line is based on the prime rate plus a margin of one half of one percent  which equals 
the remaining balance of million is based on the european libor rate for a period of days  at an effective rate equal to 
financing activities also provided million in connection with the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
cash used in financing activities included million used to pay for loan fees for our million credit facility 
our net cash position increased by million during the twelve months ended december  an important component of this change was our completion of a public offering of   adjusted for stock splits in and newly issued shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share per share split adjusted 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering after deducting offering expenses of million and underwriting discounts 
we also made capital expenditures of million and used million to purchase marketable securities during the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the primary factors contributing to cash flow from operating activities were net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a million reduction of income taxes payable due to the exercise of stock options  and increased levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses that added an aggregate of million 
these contributions were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable of million due to higher amounts of sales over the previous year  and increased levels of inventories  production tooling and prepaid expenses that totaled million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio is months  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classify short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are available for current operations 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt 
currently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments regarding our debt 
the purpose of the following analysis is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  as of december   we did not have any debt outstanding 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december   that measures the change in interest expenses due to a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve 
the analysis covers our debt 
the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately million at december  
table of contents foreign currency fluctuations we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management team to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges 
we measure the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenues  costs and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income miscellaneous
