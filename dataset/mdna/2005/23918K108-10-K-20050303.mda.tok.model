the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and item business 
overview our stated mission is to be the provider  employer and partner of choice 
we believe our attention to these three areas our patients  our teammates  and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success  aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns 
accordingly  two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover 
we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes  which we refer to as the davita quality index  or dqi 
our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years  and we ended with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved 
although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry  we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the united states 
over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover  which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements 
we will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers 
we are pleased with the overall clinical  operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years 
although our business has areas of significant potential exposure  as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis  our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors 
our operations represent a single reporting segment  with approximately of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services  of which represents on site dialysis services in centers that are wholly owned or majority owned 
our other direct dialysis services  which are operationally integrated with our center operations  relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals 

table of contents the principal drivers of our revenue are a the number of treatments  which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week  and b average treatment revenue 
the total patient base is a relatively stable factor  influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis  our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care  and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers 
our year over year treatment volume growth for was  compared with and for and approximately of our growth in each of the last two years was associated with new centers  and approximately was attributable to increased treatments 
average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government principally medicare and medicaid treatments  the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial and government reimbursement rates  and our dialysis services charge capture  billing and collecting operations performance 
on average  reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment 
the percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately over the past two years  and is currently approximately in terms of revenue dollars  approximately of our total dialysis revenue is from government or government based programs 
government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy  have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions 
medicare reimbursements represent approximately of our dialysis revenue  and cumulative increases since total approximately 
there were no medicare reimbursement rate increases for and a increase became effective on january   however this increase will be more than offset by other structural changes to medicare dialysis reimbursement rates that also became effective january  medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures 
approximately of our dialysis revenue is from commercial healthcare plans and contracted managed care payors 
commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure 
over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans  in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases 
approximately of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  and therefore changes in physician practice patterns  pharmaceutical protocols  and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels 
such changes  driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes  have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years 
our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture  billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized 
over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks 
because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry  our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks 
our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date 
changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 

table of contents our annual average revenue per treatment increased from in to in and to in these increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules impacting non contracted commercial revenue  changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial contract negotiations  and continued improvements in revenue capture  billing and collection operations  while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates 
the principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment  labor rates  vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals  and business infrastructure and compliance costs 
however  other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes 
we believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in  and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels 
labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends 
for the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors  and expect relatively stable pricing through general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years 
however  this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes  legal and other professional fees  and expanding support functions 
we expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance 
although other revenues represent less than of total revenues  successful resolutions of disputed medicare billings at our florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the carrier began making payments on medicare lab billings in the third quarter of after four years of withholding all payments 
therefore we were able to begin recognizing medicare lab revenue as services were provided  incrementally increasing income by such revenue 
medicare lab revenues for current year services amounted to million 
gambro healthcare acquisition 
on december   we entered into an agreement to acquire gambro healthcare  inc  or gambro healthcare  a subsidiary of gambro ab  one of the largest dialysis service providers in the united states  for a purchase price of approximately billion in cash 
we currently plan to finance this transaction and refinance our existing credit facility through the issuance of notes and the entry into a new senior secured credit facility 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we are entering into a year product supply agreement with gambro renal products inc  a subsidiary of gambro ab  to provide a significant majority of our dialysis equipment and supplies 
we expect that the acquisition will increase our revenues by more than based on levels 
the timing of the completion of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the government s hart scott rodino antitrust review process 
on february   the company received a request from the federal trade commission  or ftc  for additional information in connection with the acquisition 
the request extends the waiting period imposed by the hart scott rodino act until thirty days after the company and gambro healthcare have substantially complied with the request  unless that period is voluntarily extended by the parties or is terminated sooner by the ftc 
in connection with obtaining antitrust clearance  we may decide to  or the ftc or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may require us to  divest certain of our or gambro healthcare s dialysis centers 
outlook for we are currently targeting operating income to be between and higher than the level  exclusive of the effects of the gambro healthcare acquisition and related debt financing  and exclusive of the expensing of stock options required by fasb no 
r 
in connection with the gambro acquisition the company will be assessing financing alternatives  which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition 
at this time  we expect the gambro healthcare acquisition together with the related debt financing to be dilutive to earnings per share  or eps  in the first year after the 
table of contents closing of the acquisition  neutral in the second year  and accretive thereafter 
these projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties  and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections 
these risks  among others  include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from ppo and private indemnity patients  possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates  changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies  our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors  legal compliance risks  including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania and the oig and the subpoena from the us attorney s office for the eastern district of new york  and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses  including the consummation of the gambro acquisition  terms of the related financing  and subsequent integration of the businesses 
you should read risk factors in this annual report on form k for more information about these and other potential risks 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections  whether as a result of changes in underlying factors  new information  future events or other developments 
results of operations following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows year ended december  dollar amounts rounded to nearest million  except per treatment data net operating revenues current period services prior years services laboratory operating expenses and charges patient care costs general and administrative depreciation and amortization provision for uncollectible accounts recoveries minority interests and equity income  net total operating expenses and charges operating income including prior years recoveries  ie  including amounts in italics dialysis treatments average dialysis treatments per treatment day average dialysis revenue per treatment net operating revenues dialysis revenues represented approximately of net operating revenues in  and in and lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues 
operating revenues for current period services increased in and in approximately and of the increases in revenue for and were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments and approximately and was attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment 
the balance of the increase in was due to additional lab  management fees and ancillary revenue 
dialysis revenues 
dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis  home dialysis and inpatient hemodialysis under contracts with hospitals  which accounted for approximately  and of total 
table of contents dialysis revenues  respectively 
major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of epo and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment  which represents approximately of total dialysis revenues 
approximately of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs  principally medicare and medicaid  with the balance from more than commercial payors under more than commercial healthcare plans and approximately managed care contracts 
approximately of our total dialysis revenues are associated with medicare patients  who represent nearly of our total patients 
services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans are paid on average at more than double the medicare or medicaid rates 
patients covered by employer group health plans convert to medicare after a maximum of months 
as of year end  the medicare esrd dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between and per treatment  or an overall average of per treatment  excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals 
the majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors  some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule 
the commercial reimbursement rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large hmos and insurance carriers 
additionally  as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to medicare or medicaid coverage  the reimbursement rates normally decline substantially 
no single payor accounts for more than of total dialysis revenues 
the number of dialysis treatments increased in and in acquisitions accounted for and of treatment growth for and non acquired treatment growth was and for and the average dialysis revenues recognized per treatment was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in average dialysis revenues per treatment in and was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
the average dialysis revenues per treatment for the fourth quarter of was approximately our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates  which is a major profitability factor  remained relatively stable during lab and other services 
a third party carrier review of medicare reimbursement claims associated with our florida based laboratory was initiated in prior to the third quarter  no medicare payments had been received since may following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in june relating to review periods from january to march  the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to may during the fourth quarter of  the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from april through may during the second half of  the carrier paid us a total of million 
approximately million of these collections related to lab services provided through june  and the balance of million related to prior years services 
in addition to paying the prior period claims  the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of  at which time we began recognizing current period medicare lab revenue 
in late the carrier s hearing officer rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from april to may  resulting in our recognition of additional recoveries of million 
we filed requests for appeal for the remaining unsettled claims for these review periods 
in the third quarter of  an administrative law judge rendered a favorable decision regarding the majority of these unsettled claims  which resulted in our recognition of million in additional recoveries 
less than million in disputed medicare lab billings currently remain unresolved 
management fee income 
management fee income represented less than of net operating revenues for and we operated or provided administrative services to third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of december  in we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at seventeen independent third party physician practices 
our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations 

table of contents operating expenses and charges patient care costs 
patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations  and consist principally of labor  pharmaceuticals  medical supplies and facility costs 
as a percentage of current period operating revenues  patient care costs were for all periods presented 
on a per treatment basis  patient care costs increased approximately and in and  respectively 
the increases in and were principally due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
the increase in was also due to higher insurance costs 
the higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers not yet at normal productivity levels  partially offset by general labor productivity improvements 
we believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations  and include expenses for corporate and regional administration  including centralized accounting  billing and cash collection functions  and regulatory compliance oversight 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
in absolute dollars  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in and million in the increase in principally consisted of higher labor costs  professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives  and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion 
the increase in was principally due to higher labor costs 
the substantial increases in labor costs for and principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes  as well as expanding support functions 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was approximately of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from million in to million in was principally due to new center developments and acquisitions 
provision for uncollectible accounts 
the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately of current period operating revenues for each of the three years 
during  we realized recoveries of million associated with aged accounts receivable that had been reserved in the recoveries resulted from improvements made in our billing and collection processes 
minority interests and equity income  net 
minority interests net of equity income increased in by approximately million due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures 
impairments and valuation adjustments 
we perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment  amortizable intangibles  and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted 
such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans  the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners  or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance 
goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies 
no significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented 
other income other income  which was a net of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  consisted principally of interest income 
debt expense and refinancing charges debt expense for  and consisted of interest expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million 
table of contents in  and million in and the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments 
for most of we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes  which were paid off in the second half of and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our credit facility 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances 
the reduction in interest expense in as compared to was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances 
reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses 
in accordance with sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which became effective as of january   an after tax loss of million in associated with the extinguishment of debt was reclassified from an extraordinary item to a pre tax refinancing charge of million 
in  the refinancing charges of million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our convertible subordinated notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with the amendment of our bank credit agreement 
in  the refinancing charges of million related to debt restructuring  which included retiring million of senior subordinated notes due and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for represented an effective tax rate of  compared with and in and the reduction in the effective tax rate for was primarily due to lower state income taxes 
the reduction in the effective tax rate for was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses 
the effective tax rate for is currently projected to be comparable to the level 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during amounted to million  including after tax medicare lab recoveries of million  compared with million for non operating cash outflows in included million for capital asset expenditures including million for new center developments  million for acquisitions net of divestitures  and million for stock repurchases 
non operating cash outflows for included million for capital asset expenditures including million for new center developments  million for acquisitions  and million for stock repurchases 
during  we acquired a total of dialysis centers and opened new dialysis centers 
during we acquired dialysis centers for million including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership and opened new dialysis centers 
other acquisitions related to ancillary operations 
the largest acquisition during was the purchase of common stock of physicians dialysis  inc pdi  for approximately million  which added centers 
on december  we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of gambro healthcare  inc for a purchase price of approximately billion in cash 
the timing of the closing of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the government s hart scott rodino anti trust review process 
in connection with the gambro acquisition we will be assessing financing alternatives  which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions  however such commitments are subject to customary conditions 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital asset expenditures in this includes approximately to million for routine maintenance items and to million for new center developments 
this level of capital asset expenditures is consistent with our level 
we expect to open between to new centers in 
table of contents the accounts receivable balance at december  and represented approximately and days of net revenue  net of bad debt provision 
as of december   we had undrawn credit facilities totaling million of which million was committed for outstanding letters of credit 
we believe that we will have sufficient borrowing capacity and operating cash flows to fund our planned acquisitions and expansions and to meet our other obligations over the next twelve months 
capital structure changes 
in the third quarter of  we amended our existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the term loan b until june  we also borrowed an additional million under a new term loan c principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases 
the term loan c bears interest at libor plus for an overall effective rate of at december  the aggregate annual principal payments for the amended term loan b and the term loan c are approximately million and million in the first five years of the agreement  and million and million in the sixth year  respectively 
we expect to put new credit facilities in place in connection with the planned gambro healthcare acquisition 
under the previously announced board authorization for share repurchases  we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock at an average price of per share during on november   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock  from time to time  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the total outstanding board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the libor based interest rate to a fixed rate of  plus the term loan b margin of  for an overall effective rate of as of december  the total amortizing notional amount of the swap was million matched with the term loan b outstanding debt 
the agreement expires in january and requires quarterly interest payments 
as of december   the notional amount of this swap was million and its fair value was an asset of million  which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of million  net of tax 
in the third quarter of  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the libor based interest rate to a fixed rate of  plus the term loan c margin of  for an overall effective rate of as of december  the total million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the term loan c outstanding debt 
the agreement expires in august and requires quarterly interest payments 
as of december  the fair value of the swap was an asset of million  which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of million  net of tax 
at december   approximately of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed at an effective weighted average interest rate of and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was based upon current margins in effect ranging from to on december  we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the libor based interest rate to a fixed rate at effective july  the total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is million and both expire in january and require quarterly interest payments beginning in october as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was million and their fair value was an asset of million  which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of million  net of tax 
as a result of our swap agreements  we will have over of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed 

table of contents capital structure changes 
in the first quarter of  we borrowed million that was available under the term loan a of our credit facility 
the term loan a bears interest at libor plus for an overall effective rate of at december  in july  we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding million convertible subordinated notes due by issuing  shares of our common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the notes  and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest 
in july  we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to  among other things  lower the overall interest rate 
we also acquired an additional million of borrowings under the replacement term loan b  which amounted to billion 
in november  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the term loan b and to modify certain covenants 
in we completed a call for redemption of our million  convertible subordinated notes due the notes were redeemed for million in cash  including accrued interest and  shares of common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the libor based interest rate to a fixed rate of  plus the term loan b margin of for an overall effective rate of as of december  the total amortizing notional amount of this swap was million and was matched with term loan b outstanding debt 
the agreement expires in november and requires quarterly interest payments 
as of december   the notional amount of this swap was approximately million and its fair value was an asset of million which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of million  net of tax 
during  we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for approximately million  or an average of per share  pursuant to authorizations by the board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet  we have commitments associated with operating leases  letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses 
nearly all of our facilities are leased 
we have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers  in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion 
these put obligations  if exercised  would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow 
we also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers that we operate under administrative services agreements 
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions within one year years years after years total scheduled payments under contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases potential cash requirements under existing commitments letters of credit acquisition of dialysis centers working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 
table of contents contingencies our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of examination by government agencies or contractors  for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize  differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities  differing opinions regarding a patient s medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided  retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements  and claims for refunds from private payors 
on october   we received a subpoena from the united states attorney s office  or us attorney s office  for the eastern district of new york in brooklyn 
the subpoena covers the period from to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations  including our laboratory services 
the subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels  or pth  and to products relating to vitamin d therapies 
we believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation 
other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena  including fresenius medical care  renal care group and gambro healthcare 
to our knowledge  no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time 
compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense 
we cannot predict whether legal proceedings will be initiated against us relating to this investigation or  if proceedings are initiated  the outcome of any such proceedings 
in addition  criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry 
if a court determines that there has been wrongdoing  the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial 
in february the civil division of the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania in philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some historical practices  including billing and other operating procedures and financial relationships with physicians 
we cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the us attorney s office 
in may  we received a subpoena from the us attorney s office and the philadelphia office of the oig 
the subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the february request  and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients  including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services  as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies 
the subpoena covers the period from may to may we have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the united states attorney s office and the oig in its investigation 
if this review proceeds  the government could expand its areas of concern 
if a court determines that there has been wrongdoing  the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial 
in addition to the foregoing  we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings  whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities  and contingencies 
all significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary 
actual results will generally differ from these estimates 
changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods 
certain accounting estimates  including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts  impairments and valuation adjustments  and accounting for income taxes  are considered 
table of contents to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period 
the rates at which we are reimbursed are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than  commercial healthcare plans under which we receive reimbursements  often arbitrary and inconsistent reimbursements by commercial payors  ongoing insurance coverage changes  differing interpretations of contract coverage  and other payor issues 
revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in aicpa statement of position sop no 
as addressed in sop no 
 net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering  among other items  retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews  audits  billing reviews and other matters 
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on a the reimbursement rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the reimbursement rates paid by the government payor eg 
for medicare patients and b for the portion not paid by the primary government payor  the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage eg

commercial healthcare plans  including contracted managed care payors  are billed at our usual and customary rates  however  revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided 
net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements  non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known  estimated secondary collections  historical collection experience  historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments retractions  inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for reimbursements  and regulatory compliance issues 
determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than  patients at any point in time  together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month  requires complex  resource intensive processes 
collections  refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided 
our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within of total revenue  which can represent as much as of operating income 
changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses 
for example  we recognized million of prior period dialysis revenue in related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations 
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review 
impairments of long lived assets 
we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  investments  amortizable intangible assets and goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset 
table of contents will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
these calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable 
variable compensation accruals 
we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals 
our estimates  which include compensation incentives for bonuses  awards and benefit plan contributions  are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award 
actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals  as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors 
significant new accounting standard for in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  that amends fasb statements no 
and  and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service 
the grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments 
the statement also addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement does not change the accounting for transactions in which a company issues equity instruments for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
this statement is effective beginning in the third quarter of  and requires us to recognize compensation costs on outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered 
we currently project that the adoption of this standard will reduce pre tax income by less than million for the second half of 
table of contents risk factors this annual report on form k contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below 
the risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business 
please read the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if the average rates that private payors pay us decline  then our revenues  earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced 
approximately of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor 
the majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us on terms and at rates materially higher than medicare rates 
based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors  we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase 
if the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
if the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines  then our revenues  earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced 
our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans 
a patient s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons  including as a result of changes in the patient s or a family member s employment status 
for a patient covered by an employer group health plan  medicare generally becomes the primary payor after months  or earlier if the patient s employer group health plan coverage terminates 
when medicare becomes the primary payor  the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the medicare reimbursement rate 
if there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to government based programs that pay at lower rates it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
future declines  or the lack of further increases  in medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
approximately one half of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have medicare as their primary payor 
the medicare esrd program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates 
unlike most other medicare programs  the medicare esrd program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates 
increases of in and in were the first increases in the composite reimbursement rate since  and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation over the same period 
for through  there was no increase in the composite reimbursement rate 
effective january   there was an increase of only 
increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation  such as labor and supply costs  have occurred and are expected to continue to occur regardless of whether there is a compensating increase in reimbursement rates 
we cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes  if any 
to the extent these rates decline or are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation  our revenues  earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected 
changes in the structure of  and reimbursement rates under  the medicare esrd program could substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
the medicare composite reimbursement rate covers the cost of treatment  including the supplies used in those treatments  specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals 
other services and pharmaceuticals  including epo  vitamin d analogs and iron supplements  are separately billed 
changes to the structure of the composite rate and separately billable reimbursement rates became effective on january  these changes 
table of contents more than offset the composite rate increase that also became effective january  in addition  effective april   the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  plans to implement a case mix adjustment payment methodology which is designed to pay differential composite service rates based on a variety of patient characteristics 
if the case mix adjustment is not properly implemented it could adversely affect the medicare reimbursement rates 
future changes in the structure of  and reimbursement rates under  the medicare esrd program could substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
cms continues to study the esrd reimbursement system through a number of demonstration projects which will take place over the next few years 
the changes that went into effect on january  include changes in the way we are reimbursed for certain pharmaceuticals that are currently billed outside the composite rate 
pharmaceuticals are approximately one half of our total medicare revenues 
if medicare begins to include in its composite reimbursement rate pharmaceuticals  laboratory services or other ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately  or if there are further changes to or decreases in the reimbursement rate for these items without a corresponding increase in the composite rate  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
changes in state medicaid programs or reimbursement rates could reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
more than of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have medicaid as their primary coverage 
state governments may propose reductions in reimbursement rates  limitations on eligibility or other changes to medicaid programs from time to time 
if state governments reduce the rates paid by those programs for dialysis and related services  limit eligibility for medicaid coverage or adopt changes similar to those adopted by medicare  then our revenues  earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 
changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for epo and other pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
the administration of epo and other pharmaceuticals accounts for approximately of our total dialysis revenues 
changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices  changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria  the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and the conversion to alternate types of administration could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
for example  some medicare fiscal intermediaries medicare claims processing contractors are seeking to implement local medical review policies for epo and vitamin d analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these pharmaceuticals 
cms has proposed a draft reimbursement policy that would direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for epo 
it is possible that the draft policy  if finalized  will affect physician prescription patterns and the timing of our cash flows due to changes in auditing methodology by fiscal intermediaries 
adverse developments with respect to epo and the introduction of aranesp could materially reduce our earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients 
amgen is the sole supplier of epo and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for epo at any time 
for example  amgen unilaterally increased its base price for epo by in each of  and although we have entered into contracts for epo pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria and other criteria  we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the discount structure for epo that we currently receive  or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved 
an increase in the cost of epo could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 
amgen has developed and obtained fda approval for aranesp  a new pharmaceutical used to treat anemia that may replace epo or reduce its use with dialysis patients 
unlike epo  which is generally administered in 
table of contents conjunction with each dialysis treatment  aranesp can remain effective for between two and three weeks 
in the event that amgen begins to market aranesp for the treatment of dialysis patients  we may realize lower margins on the administration of aranesp than are currently realized with epo 
in addition  some physicians may begin to administer aranesp in their offices  which would prevent us from recognizing revenue or profit from the administration of epo or aranesp to those physicians patients 
a significant increase in the use of aranesp would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
the investigation related to the subpoena we received on october  from the us attorney s office for the eastern district of new york could result in substantial penalties against us 
we are voluntarily cooperating with the us attorney s office for the eastern district of new york and the oig with respect to the subpoena we received on october   which requested a wide range of documents  including specific documents relating to testing of parathyroid hormone levels and products relating to vitamin d therapies 
other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena including gambro healthcare  fresenius medical care and renal care group 
the us attorney s office has also requested information regarding our florida laboratory 
compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense 
we are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved  whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters  financial or otherwise 
in addition  criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry 
any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us  exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and criminal penalties 
the pending federal review related to the subpoena we received in may from the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania could result in substantial penalties against us 
we are voluntarily cooperating with the civil division of the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania and the oig in a review of some historical practices  including billing and other operating procedures  financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies  and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services  including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services 
the us attorney s office has also requested and received information regarding certain of our laboratories 
we are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved  whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters  financial or otherwise 
any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local government regulations  including medicare and medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations  federal and state anti kickback laws  stark ii physician self referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes  and federal and state laws regarding the collection  use and disclosure of patient health information 
the regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers  including dialysis providers  has increased significantly in recent years 
medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly in recent years 
in addition  fiscal intermediaries are increasing their prepayment and post payment reviews 
we endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws and the stark ii physicians self referral law 
however  the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
for example  none of our medical director agreements establishes compensation using the anti kickback safe harbor method  rather  compensation under our medical director agreements is the result of individual negotiation and the company believes exceeds amounts determined in that manner 
if an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors  we could be required to 
table of contents change our practices  face criminal or civil penalties  pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements 
due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states  all of our dialysis operations in new york and some of our dialysis operations in new jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services 
these operations account for approximately of our dialysis revenues 
we believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states  but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged 
if any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations  we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows including mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses  suspension or termination of our participation in government reimbursement programs  refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements  loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs  loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate  including the loss of revenues from operations in new york and new jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above  fines  damages or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations  stark ii violations  submission of false claims  civil or criminal liability based on violations of law  or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations  claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws  and termination of relationships with medical directors 
we may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows 
the administration of dialysis and related services to patients may subject us to litigation and liability for damages 
our business  profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage 
we currently maintain programs of general and professional liability insurance 
however  a successful professional liability  malpractice or negligence claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our profitability and liquidity 
in addition  if our costs of insurance and claims increase  then our earnings could decline 
market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing 
our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following further increases in premiums and deductibles  increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims  and an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms 
if businesses we acquire have unknown liabilities  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers 
businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we had estimated 
these liabilities could include liabilities arising as a result of any failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations  such as violations of federal or state anti kickback statutes or stark ii 
although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for 
table of contents matters that are not properly disclosed to us  we are not always successful 
in addition  even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification  we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party 
in the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers  whether due to regulatory or other reasons  then our revenues  earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced 
many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers 
as a result  the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center 
if a medical director agreement terminates  whether before or at the end of its term  and a new medical director is appointed  it may negatively impact the former medical director s decision to treat his or her patients at our center 
additionally  both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers 
also  if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorate  it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes 
our medical director contracts are for fixed periods  generally five to ten years 
medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us 
as of january   there were centers  accounting for approximately of our treatment volume  at which the medical director agreements require renewal on or before december  we may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute  stark ii law and other similar laws 
these actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us 
if the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws  we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement  or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers 
if our joint ventures were found to violate the law  we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
as of december  we operated dialysis centers  representing approximately of our dialysis revenue  that are owned by joint ventures in which we own a controlling interest and one or more physicians or physician practice groups have a minority interest 
the physician owners may also provide medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate 
because our relationships with physicians are governed by the anti kickback statute contained in the social security act  we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible 
however  our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti kickback statute 
based on the exceptions applicable to esrd services  we believe that our joint venture arrangements and operations materially comply with the stark ii law 
if the joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti kickback statute or the stark provisions  we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship 
we also could be required to repay to medicare amounts received by the joint ventures pursuant to prohibited referrals  and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs 
if our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties  we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 

table of contents the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business 
we have substantial debt outstanding and if we consummate the proposed gambro healthcare acquisition we will incur substantial additional debt 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our current and proposed indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest on the debt under some of our indebtedness may be at variable rates  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
if additional debt financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to grow our business  take advantage of business opportunities  respond to competitive pressures or refinance maturing debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts  including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future  will depend on our ability to generate cash 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  that our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets 
as such  our ability to refinance our debt or seek additional financing could be limited by such security interest 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues  we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses 
we are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel 
we compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers 
this nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations 
if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed  our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted  which would result in reduced revenues  earnings and cash flows 

table of contents provisions in our charter documents  compensation programs and delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests 
our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers  delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management  or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests 
these include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent  requiring days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our board of directors and granting our board of directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval  and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve 
in addition  most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control 
we have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards  which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control 
based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on december   these cash bonuses would total approximately million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our board of directors did not modify the program 
these compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law that  subject to exceptions  would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder  as defined in that section  for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these restrictions may discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of our company 
these provisions may discourage  delay or prevent an acquisition of our company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
the gambro healthcare acquisition is significantly larger than any other acquisition we have made to date 
we will face challenges integrating the gambro healthcare centers and may not realize anticipated benefits 
the gambro healthcare acquisition is the largest acquisition we have attempted to date 
there is a risk that  due to the size of the acquisition  we will be unable to integrate gambro healthcare into our operations as effectively as we have with prior acquisitions  which would result in fewer benefits to us from the acquisition than currently anticipated as well as increased costs 
the integration of the gambro healthcare operations will require implementation of appropriate operations  management and financial reporting systems and controls 
we may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems and integrating gambro healthcare s systems and operations 
in addition  the integration of gambro healthcare will require the focused attention of our management team  including a significant commitment of their time and resources 
the need for management to focus on integration matters  could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results 
if the integration is not successful or if our gambro healthcare operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate  our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we will assume substantially all of gambro healthcare s liabilities  including contingent liabilities 
if these liabilities are greater than expected  or if there are unknown gambro healthcare obligations  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the gambro healthcare acquisition  we will assume substantially all of gambro healthcare s liabilities  including contingent liabilities 
we may learn additional information about gambro healthcare s 
table of contents business that adversely affects us  such as unknown liabilities  issues relating to internal controls over financial reporting  issues that could affect our ability to comply with the sarbanes oxley act after we acquire gambro healthcare or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws  including laws and regulations governing dialysis operations 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the gambro healthcare acquisition will be successful or will not  in fact  harm our business 
among other things  if gambro healthcare s liabilities are greater than expected  or if there are obligations of gambro healthcare of which we are not aware at the time of completion of the acquisition  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we have limited indemnification rights in connection with these and other regulatory compliance and litigation matters affecting gambro healthcare  as well as known contingent liabilities of gambro healthcare that we will assume 
for example  gambro healthcare was served a complaint regarding a former employee and a putative class of employees in california for claims relating to california labor laws 
although this matter is subject to indemnification under the acquisition agreement  claims relating to this matter may exceed the limit on our indemnification rights 
gambro healthcare may also have other unknown liabilities which we will be responsible for after the acquisition 
if we are responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
the integration of gambro healthcare and the realization of cost savings will require us to make significant expenditures 
in order to obtain the cost savings and operating income that we believe the integration of gambro healthcare should provide  we will be required to make significant expenditures 
we are in the early stages of planning for the integration process and are uncertain as to the extent and amount of these expenditures 
further  given the amount of indebtedness that we will incur as part of the gambro healthcare acquisition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing required for any significant expenditures on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may not achieve the cost savings we expect through the integration of the gambro healthcare operations regardless of our expenditures  which failure would materially and adversely affect our financial results 
the costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate 
if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for gambro healthcare employees after the acquisition  we may not be able to effectively integrate their operations 
in order to successfully integrate the gambro healthcare operations into our own  we will require the services of gambro healthcare s clinical  operating and administrative employees 
if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for gambro healthcare employees  we may not be able to effectively integrate gambro healthcare s systems and operations 
if we lose the services of a significant number of gambro healthcare s medical directors  our results of operations could be harmed 
certain of gambro healthcare s contracts with its medical directors provide that the contract is terminable upon a change of control of gambro healthcare 
these termination provisions would be triggered by our acquisition of gambro healthcare 
if we lose the services of a significant number of gambro healthcare s medical directors  our results of operations may be harmed 
our alliance and product supply agreement with gambro renal products inc will limit our ability to achieve costs savings with respect to products and equipment we are required to purchase under this agreement 
in connection with the gambro healthcare acquisition  we will enter into a ten year alliance and product supply agreement with gambro renal products inc  a subsidiary of gambro ab  pursuant to which we will be 
table of contents required to purchase from gambro renal products specified percentages of our requirements for hemodialysis products  supplies and equipment at fixed prices 
this will limit our ability to realize future cost savings in regard to these products and equipment 
for the twelve months ended december   our total spending on hemodialysis products  supplies and equipment was approximately of our total operating costs 
if gambro renal products is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement  we may have difficulty finding alternative sources of supplies on favorable financial terms  further reducing our ability to achieve cost savings 
in addition  as we replace existing equipment from other third party manufacturers with gambro renal products equipment  we may incur additional expenses as we transition to this new equipment 
the consummation of the gambro healthcare acquisition is subject to a number of conditions  if these conditions are not satisfied or waived  we will not be able to consummate the acquisition 
the stock purchase agreement relating to the gambro healthcare acquisition contains a number of conditions which must be satisfied or waived prior to the closing of the acquisition 
these conditions include  among others  execution and delivery of the transition services agreement and the alliance product and supply agreement and receipt of regulatory approvals  including antitrust clearance 
on february   we received a request from the federal trade commission for additional information in connection with its review of our anti trust filing 
we intend to respond promptly to this request 
the effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the hart scott rodino act until thirty days after we and gambro healthcare have substantially complied with the request  unless that period is extended voluntarily by us and gambro healthcare or is terminated sooner by the ftc 
in addition  one or more states attorneys general could attempt to impose conditions or otherwise interfere with the proposed acquisition 
in connection with obtaining antitrust clearance  we may decide to  or the federal trade commission or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may request that we divest certain of our or gambro healthcare s dialysis centers 
these divestitures could be material 
in addition  we will require financing in order to consummate the gambro healthcare acquisition 
we have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions  however such commitments are subject to customary conditions 
we therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all or that we will be able to consummate the gambro healthcare acquisition on the terms described herein or at all 
if we do not cause gambro healthcare to comply and gambro healthcare does not comply with its corporate integrity agreement  or gambro healthcare otherwise has failed or fails to comply with applicable government regulations to its operations  we could be subject to additional penalties and otherwise may be materially harmed 
on december   gambro healthcare entered into a settlement agreement with the department of justice and certain agencies of the united states government relating to the department of justice s investigation of gambro healthcare s medicare and medicaid billing practices and its relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in connection with the settlement agreement  gambro healthcare  without admitting liability  made a one time payment of approximately million and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with hhs 
in addition  its subsidiary  gambro supply corp  entered a plea of guilty to a one count felony charge related to the conduct of its predecessor  ren supply corp  and paid a criminal fine of million 
gambro supply corp 
was excluded from participation in federal health care programs 
however  no other gambro ab affiliates were so excluded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of december  for our debt obligations with variable interest rates  the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of including the economic effects of our swap agreements 
these rates are based on libor plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the impact from the swap agreements 
the margins currently in effect range from to 
expected maturity date total fair value average interest rate thereafter dollars in millions long term debt fixed rate variable rate our senior credit facility is based on a floating libor interest rate plus a margin  which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months 
as a result  our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as libor interest rates change 
we have entered into three interest rate swap agreements  two matched on our term loan b outstanding debt and one matched on our term loan c outstanding debt 
as of december   the total notional amount of these swap agreements was million and the interest rates were economically modified to fixed rates ranging from to plus the term loan margins ranging from to  in effect as of december  this resulted in an overall effective rate of as of december   on approximately of our outstanding debt 
two of the swap agreements expire in and one in as of december   the fair value of the swaps was an asset of million 
as a result of these swap agreements  our overall effective weighted average interest rate of our credit facility was based upon current margins in effect ranging from to as of december  we also have entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the libor based interest rate to become a fixed rate at effective july  the total amortizing notional amount of the two swaps is million and both expire in january and require quarterly interest payments beginning in october as of december   the fair value of these swaps was an asset of million 
as a result of all of our swap agreements  we will have over of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed 
one means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all variable rate maturities referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  with all else constant  it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately million  million and million  net of tax  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
exchange rate sensitivity we are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk
