item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are the successor to icm property investors  incorporated icm  a real estate investment trust reit incorporated in delaware in in july  icm was reorganized in the state of maryland under the name of bedford property investors  inc equipped with a new board of directors and a new management team  we became a self administered and self managed equity reit  engaged in the business of owning  managing  acquiring and developing industrial and suburban office properties proximate to metropolitan areas in the western united states 
as of december   we owned operating properties totaling approximately million rentable square feet and parcels of land totaling approximately acres 
in addition  we owned three office properties and one research and development property currently under redevelopment 
of the operating properties  are industrial properties and are suburban office properties 
our propertie s are located in california  arizona  washington  colorado  nevada  and oregon 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in this report 
market conditions the northwest region we believe that the puget sound area is still experiencing the effects of significant job loss resulting from the technology and telecommunication industry slowdowns 
we also believe that these economic conditions have affected most commercial real estate markets causing excess space  both in the direct leasing and sub leasing markets  and weaker deal terms 
at december   our northwest operating portfolio  which includes three oregon properties  was occupied with  square feet vacant in three properties 
we believe that this comparatively strong occupancy has insulated us from the worst effects of local market conditions 
in february  one of our largest tenants in this region vacated our  square foot five building complex upon expiration of its lease 
we have transferred this property to our development portfolio and have commenced a program to re position the complex as a campus style office park 
in  we completed the first phase of this repositioning  and had signed two leases by year end 
the northern california region our properties in northern california are located throughout the san francisco bay area and include one property in reno  nevada 
the bay area market has also been impacted by the technology industry slowdown  particularly in the silicon valley area  where we own properties totaling  square feet as of december  in this sub market  we believe that the job loss associated with the earlier recession has been significant  resulting in increased vacancy and reduced rental rates 
while the california employment situation has shown some improvement in recent months  the oversupply of space and reduced rental rates continue to be a challenge 
in addition  we expect higher than usual lease expirations in the silicon valley to continue during  which creates the potential for increasing vacancy in our portfolio 
in order to retain good credit tenants in the current market  we have engaged in a strategy to negotiate lower re ntal rates in exchange for extended lease terms  which we refer to as blend and extend leases 
another bay area sub market that has demonstrated weakness during the last few years is the south san francisco industrial market 
in december  we sold four of our five properties in south san francisco  leaving one leased property remaining in this sub market 
other bay area sub markets have not been as dramatically affected as the south san francisco industrial market and the fremont  milpitas  and san jose markets in silicon valley 
in sonoma county  napa county  and contra costa county sub markets  while demand has slowed during the past three years  vacancy rates have not climbed to the extent they have in silicon valley 
the southern california region in southern california  we have properties in three relatively healthy sub markets 
these sub markets are orange county  san diego  and the inland empire 
we have two properties in orange county and maintained them at  or close to  occupancy during and in the inland empire  we have a bulk industrial property in ontario  california  which was leased as of december  we have two recently developed properties in the inland empire  the jurupa business center phase i  which was leased as of december   and jurupa business center phase i i  which was leased as of december  in addition  the jurupa business center phases iii and iv became shell complete during the fourth quarter of and are currently leased 
finally  in san diego  our properties were leased during the years and the arizona region most of our properties in arizona are in phoenix  a market that has been characterized by the same weakness in demand for office  research and development  and industrial space that we have experienced in other regions 
we have responded to these challenges by improving our marketing processes and the marketability of our vacant spaces 
we are making capital improvements to our vacant spaces to render them near move in condition for prospective tenants 
notwithstanding these efforts  however  re leasing space in phoenix remains challenging  and we expect our vacant suites to remain vacant for longer periods than we have previously experienced 
as of december   our properties in this region were leased  with approximately  square feet of vacant space in eight properties 
the colorado region all of our properties in colorado are in the southeast denver suburban office market 
we believe that market conditions in denver reflect the effects of the significant job losses experienced in this region during the last several years  similar to other markets 
in july  we were successful in executing a significant lease with a large insurance company for the top two floors of our dtc boulevard property  representing of the total square footage of the building 
this ten story office property was leased to a single tenant under a lease that expired on january   which the tenant opted not to renew 
during the last several years  we have made significant capital improvements to this property in preparation for this vacancy and are actively marketing the space to prospective tenants 
future trends and events acquisitions and dispositions in september  we announced that our board of directors would undertake a review of a broad range of strategic alternatives for our company 
these alternatives included the potential sale or merger of our company  selling certain of our properties and either reinvesting these proceeds in other properties or dividending out the proceeds to our stockholders 
on february   the board of directors announced the conclusion of its review of strategic alternatives 
the board of directors determined that the interests of our stockholders would be best served by the company s continuation as an independent  publicly traded reit 
as a result  we intend to continue to operate in the office  service and industrial space  with a shift in focus to properties with multi tenant configurations 
capitalization rates continue to remain low as the result of the large amount of capital available in the marketplace and the low cost of debt 
while we have  in the past  been successful at acquiring properties that we believe will enhance our portfolio  it has become increasingly challenging to find properties that meet our target capitalization rate of 
however  we will continue to evaluate  and may capitalize on  opportunities to acquire attractive properties or portfolios of properties as and when they arise 
to accomplish our goal of continuing to reposition ourselves as a multi tenant reit  we may also enter into complementary acquisitions of other businesses 
in addition  we intend to continue to sell selected properties in order to reposition our portfolio and to take advantage of the current low capitalization rates in the market 
properties that will be considered for sale include those that we believe have reached their full potential and can produce a significant gain on sale 
as part of continuing to reposition ourselves as a multi tenant reit  we are also shifting our focus away from single tenant properties to multi tenant properties in an effort to reduce the vacancy risk associated with large  single tenant buildings 
as a result  we may also sell properties that do not meet our multi tenant configuration criteria  as and when appropriate opportunities arise 
development and redevelopment in response to decreasing demand for office and industrial space  our development activities over the past two years have been limited to our jurupa business center project in ontario  california 
as of february  the  square foot phase i was leased  and the  square foot phase i i  which was shell complete in december  was leased 
in october  we completed construction on the final two phases 
phases iii and iv total  square feet and are currently leased 
in total  the four phases of the jurupa business center comprise  square feet and are leased as of february in march  we also began our redevelopment of the recently vacated  square foot five building facility in renton  washington 
the construction process for site work  shell enhancement  construction of lobbies  and the upgrade of common areas is expected to take place over a month period 
the construction will be completed in phases  with the completion and leasing of some of the buildings occurring prior to the end of the month period 
phase i of exterior and common area construction of this redevelopment project was completed in september we hosted a well attended open house celebration introducing the community to the re positioned property 
shortly thereafter  the first two leases  which will commence in the first quarter of  were secured for  square feet  or of the phase i square footage 
in april  we purchased a  square foot industrial building in phoenix  arizona with the intent to redevelop the property to accommodate the expansion requirements of one of our existing tenants in another property 
the redevelopment began in august and has an expected completion date in the second quarter of and an estimated redevelopment cost of approximately million  of which approximately million will be funded by us and approximately million will be funded by the tenant 
in september  we purchased an  square foot office research and development property in hillsboro  oregon 
the property was acquired in shell complete condition with the intent to complete the final build out and lease up of the building 
the expected cost of development to bring this property to operating status is approximately million over an month period 
capital expenditures we expect the higher than usual lease expirations in our portfolio that occurred during to continue throughout prior to  annual lease expirations in our portfolio ranged from approximately to of our annualized base rents 
as of december   our expected lease expirations for were of annualized base rents 
as a result  we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in  including the costs of leasing commissions and tenant improvements related to renewing or replacing the expiring leases 
in several instances  these lease expirations may occur in markets that have experienced considerable weakness due to job loss and excess inventory 
this market weakness  combined with a higher level of lease expirations  may require us to incur more capital expenditures than we have experienced historically to renew or re lease these spaces 
in addition  we are renovating two properties that were leased by single tenants who did not renew their leases  which will also result in additional capital expenditures in we believe that these renovations are necessary to render the properties competitive in their respective markets 
the combination of these two factors will require that we manage our capital resources carefully 
we intend to closely monitor these situations and continually assess our actual expenditures against our planned expenditures 
we believe that we will have sufficient funds to meet the needs of these situations 
we plan to spend approximately million in capital expenditures during the year share repurchases since the inception of our share repurchase program in november of  we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  which represents of the shares of common stock outstanding at november we intend to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market when the opportunities exist 
our share repurchase strategy takes into consideration several factors  including the dividend yield on our stock price  the cost of capital and its alternative uses  existing yields on potential acquisitions  market trading volume  trading regulations  and debt covenants 
we currently have board approval to repurchase up to a total of million shares of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased or acquired  shares of our common stock at an average price of 
we acquired  shares in open market repurchases made pursuant to ou r share repurchase program and  shares from employees to satisfy payroll tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock or in connection with stock option exercises  which were not repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program 
we did not purchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program during the second half of occupancy and rental rates as of december   our operating portfolio occupancy was at  a percentage point decrease from the occupancy as of december  
maintaining our occupancy rate has been our highest priority during this economic downturn 
in order to retain tenants in the current market  we have sometimes found it necessary to negotiate lower rental rates in exchange for extended terms  which we refer to as blend and extend leases 
while this has a negative impact on our income from operations  we believe the negative impact of losing good credit tenants would surpass the incremental loss due to reduced rental rates 
during the year ended december   we renewed or re leased of expiring leases or of our expiring square footage and experienced a decline in weighted average rental rates on these leases 
we intend to continue this strategy in order to maximize our occupancy rate 
leasing over the next three years  we will be facing significant lease rollovers 
during the years   and  leases representing   and of annualized base rent  respectively  will expire 
as of december   the expirations as a percentage of annualized base rent by region are as follows northern california arizona southern california northwest colorado nevada total in order to manage the risk associated with higher lease expirations in weaker markets  we developed a plan to focus our attention on a group of our largest tenants 
at its inception in june of  this group consisted of tenants  with lease expirations scheduled to occur through the year although the tenants represented of our total tenant group  the revenue associated with these tenants represented over of our portfolio annualized base rent 
for each of these tenants  we have been pursuing a proactive approach by creating specific strategies for renewal 
these approaches may involve blend and extend leases  early renewals  and other appropriate measures 
we have recently begun focusing on additional tenants with leases expiring through the year and plan to continue our focus on this expanded group of tenants 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgments and estimates such as those related to valuation of real estate investments  classification of discontinued operations  accounting for development costs  revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  stock compensation expense  and qualification as a reit  each of which is discussed in more detail below 
these estimates are made and evaluated on an on going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates  and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of real estate investments real estate investments are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of real estate includes the purchase price and other related acquisition costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  a portion of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
for acquired properties with rental guarantees from the seller  amounts received under the rental guarantee are recorded as a reduction to the basis of the asset upon receipt 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed 
expenditures for asset replacements or significant improvements that extend the life or increase the property s value are capitalized 
real estate properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate an impairment of a property  we will recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the property 
the fair value of a property is determined by using an internally developed discounted cash flow analysis 
the evaluation of the fair value of individual properties re quires significant management judgments and assumptions that affect the amount of any impairment loss that we may recognize 
significant changes in the facts and circumstances underlying these judgments and assumptions in future periods could cause significant impairment adjustments to be recorded 
the acquisition of real estate investments results in the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a historical basis prorated over the remaining lease terms 
they are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place operating leases as follows i origination value  which represents the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in our markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  iii fair market value of acquired leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks  and iv value of tenant relationships  which reflects estimated future benefits from enhanced renewal probabilities and cost savings in lease commissions and tenant improvements 
origination value is recorded as an other asset and is amortized over the remaining lease terms 
value of in place leases is recorded as an other asset and amortized over the average term of the acquired leases 
fair m arket value of acquired leases is classified as an other asset or liability  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases 
value of tenant relationships is classified as an other asset and is amortized over the anticipated term of the customer relationship  not to exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
classification of discontinued operations we record real estate investments that are considered held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell  and such properties are no longer depreciated 
we classify real estate assets as held for sale in the period in which both of the following criteria are met management has obtained board approval to sell the asset  and a letter of intent has been signed by an officer of the c ompany and the buyer 
we present the net operating results of properties held for sale and sold during the year  less allocated interest expense  as income from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the gain on sale of operating properties sold  net of sale costs  is presented as income from discontinued operations 
we allocate interest expense based on the percentage of the cost basis of each property held for sale and sold to the total cost basis of real estate assets as of the respective year end  pro rated for the number of days prior to sale 
accounting for development costs in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate  costs associated with the development of real estate include acquisition and direct construction costs as well as capitalization of real estate taxes  insurance  incidental revenue and expenses  and a portion of salaries and overhead of personnel responsible for development activity 
in addition  we capitalize interest expense to the development projects according to sfas  capitalization of interest cost 
the amount of interest capitalized during a period is determined by applying the weighted average rate of our borrowings to the average accumulated costs  excluding interest  of the project 
the capitalization of interest  real estate taxes  insurance  and incidental revenue and expenses begins when construction of a project commences and ends when a project or a portion of the project is placed in service  not to exceed twelve months from the cessation of construction activities 
the capitalization of salaries and overhead of development personnel commences upon development approval from the prevailing governing authorities and ends with completion of the project 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts base rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective lease agreements 
differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged  as applicable  to rent receivable 
the amount of straight line rent receivable is charged against income upon early termination of a lease or as a reduction of gain on sale of the property 
in the event a tenant downsizes into a smaller space with reduced rent  a pro rated amount of the straight line rent receivable is charged against income based on square footage 
lease termination income is recorded when we have an executed lease termination agreement with no further contractual obligations that must be met before the fee is due to us 
if a tenant remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement  the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such tenant s occupancy 
in accordance with sfas  business combinations  a portion of the purchase price of acquired properties is allocated to the market value of in place leases 
the market value of in place leases is classified as an other asset or liability and is amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the leases 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments  which results in a reduction to income 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual tenant receivables  taking into account the tenant s financial condition  security deposits  any letters of credit  any lease guarantees  and current economic conditions 
significant judgments and estimates must be made by management and used in connection with establishing this allowance in any accounting period 
in the event that the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to cover the actual amount of accounts that are subsequently written off in an accounting p eriod  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge in our income statement 
stock compensation expense beginning january   we voluntarily adopted the recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as prescribed in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas the modified prospective method provides for the calculation of the compensation expense as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all stock options granted in fiscal years after december  management is required to make certain assumptions in calculating the amount of any stock based compensation expense  including assumptions relating to the fair value of options 
in determining the fair value of options  we make assumptions about the future volatility of our stock  the expected term to exercise the options  the expected dividend yields  and the risk free interest rate 
the underl ying assumptions affect amounts reported in future periods 
qualification as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections to of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of real estate investment trust taxable income that is distributed to stockholders  provided that at least of such taxable income is distributed and other requirements are met 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit  we would be  among other things  required to provide for federal income taxes on our income and reduce the level of distributions made to our stockholders 
results of operations our operations consist of developing  owning and operating industrial and suburban office properties located primarily in the western united states 
variances in net income and cash flows for the year ended december  when compared with the same period in were due primarily to the acquisition  sale  development and redevelopment of operating properties as follows office properties industrial properties total operating properties number of properties square feet number of properties square feet number of properties square feet total at january  activity from january  through december  acquisitions development total at december  activity from january  through december  acquisitions sales development redevelopment transfer to redevelopment total at december  properties are included in development based on the date of shell completion

the increases in operating expenses of  or  real estate taxes of  or  and depreciation and amortization of  or are primarily due to additional expenses incurred for properties acquired during and and increased rental expenses on stabilized properties 
the increase of  in operating expenses on the stabilized properties is generally attributable to higher repairs and maintenance spending  which was increased in order to attract potential tenants in competitive markets 
the increase of  in real estate taxes on the stabilized properties is due to re assessment of the value of properties developed in recent years  as well as overall increases in tax rates 
the increase in depreciation and amortization of  on the stabilized properties is attributable to a greater level of capital improvement spending required to obtain tenants

financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased approximately   to   for the twelve months ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the same period in the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to reduced proceeds from new mortgages in as compared to  increased net payments on our credit facility with proceeds from the sale of operating properties  and increased dividend payments for the preferred shares issued in and these increases in cash used were partially offset by additional cash provided by our series b preferred stock offering in available borrowings  capital resources  and cash balances we expect to meet our long term liquidity and capital requirements  such as funding capital expenditures  costs associated with lease renewals and re leasing of space  the cost of acquisitions  repayment of indebtedness  share repurchases  development of properties  and dividends from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and  if available  other indebtedness which may include indebtedness assumed in acquisitions or the refinancing of existing indebtedness  the sale of real estate investments  and issuance of long term debt and equity securities 
on april   we completed a public offering of  shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to finance the purchase of four operating properties  one redevelopment project and three parcels of land totaling acres in the second and third quarters of  which totaled approximately million 
our line of credit  which has a total commitment of million plus an accordion feature for expansion of million  had a zero outstanding balance and letters of credit issued and undrawn of  at december   leaving approximately  of available borrowing 
we anticipate utilizing this available borrowing capacity and or sale proceeds from real estate assets to fund our investing activities in  including estimated development and redevelopment costs of approximately million and capital expenditures of approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  including approximately  of restricted cash 
restricted cash represents security deposits held in interest bearing cash deposit accounts in accordance with tenant leases 
unrestricted cash includes approximately  held in a liquidity management investment account investing in money market instruments that are backed by us government short term securities and approximately  held in short term us treasury bills 
the balance of the unrestricted cash is in a demand deposit account which is used to fund our disbursements 
we anticipate that the cash flow generated by our real estate investments and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
debt financing our ability to continue to finance operations is subject to several uncertainties 
for example  our ability to obtain mortgage loans on income producing property is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain tenants and the economics of the various markets in which the properties are located  as well as the willingness of mortgage lending institutions to make loans secured by real property 
approximately of our real estate investments served as collateral for our existing mortgage indebtedness and available borrowing under our credit facility as of december  our ability to sell real estate investments is partially dependent upon the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at reasonable commercial rates 
we currently have a revolving credit facility with a bank group led by bank of america 
the facility  which matures on march   consists of a million secured line with an accordion feature that allows us at our option to expand the facility to million  if needed 
interest on the facility is at a floating rate equal to either the lender s prime rate or libor plus a margin ranging from to  depending on our leverage level 
as of december   the facility did not have an outstanding balance 
in april  we assumed a mortgage with an outstanding balance of approximately  in connection with the acquisition of a property 
the mortgage with thrivent financial for lutherans carried a fixed interest rate of and had a maturity date of april  subsequently  in july  we renegotiated the mortgage with a then outstanding balance of  resulting in an increased loan amount  an extended term  and a lower interest rate

the operating properties that served as collateral for our mortgages had a net book value of approximately  as of december  we were in compliance with the covenants and requirements of our various mortgage loans payable during the years ended december  and contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands amount of commitment expiring by period less than year years years over years total bank loan payable mortgage loans payable interest obligations on bank loan and mortgage loans construction contract commitments stand by letters of credit total related party transactions we occasionally use the services of the law firm bartko  zankel  tarrant miller of which a member of our board of directors  martin i 
zankel  is a senior principal 
during the years ended december    and  we paid bartko  zankel  tarrant miller approximately   and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
as of december   we had outstanding undrawn letters of credit against our credit facility of approximately  the letters of credit were required by our various lenders as substitution for insurance and real estate impound accounts  as temporary substitution of collateral for a sold property  and as security for a vacancy in a property serving as collateral for a mortgage 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect our actual financial performance and may cause our future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include the following we could experience a reduction in rental income if we are unable to renew or re lease space on expiring leases on current lease terms  or at all 
a significant portion of our leases is scheduled to expire in the near future 
as of december   leases representing    and of our total annualized base rent were scheduled to expire during    and  respectively 
if the rental rates upon re leasing or renewal of leases were significantly lower than current rates  or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space on economically favorable terms  or at all  our results of operations could suffer 
we are subject to the risk that  upon expiration  some of these or other leases will not be renewed  the space may not be re leased  or the terms of renewal or re leasing  including the costs of required renovations or concessions to tenants  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
we could face difficulties re leasing our space on commercially acceptable terms when it becomes available 
in addition  we expect to incur costs in making improvemen ts or repairs to our properties required by new or renewing tenants and expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the re leasing of space 
similarly  our rental income could be reduced by vacancies resulting from lease expirations or by rental rates that are less favorable than our current terms 
if we are unable to promptly renew leases or re lease space or if the expenses relating to tenant turnover are greater than expected  our financial results could be harmed 
our leases with our largest tenants generate approximately of our base rent  and the loss of one or more of these tenants  as well as the inability to re lease this space on equivalent terms  could harm our results of operations 
as of december   our largest tenants accounted for approximately of our total annualized base rent 
in the event that one or more of our larger tenants were to vacate or not renew their lease with us  the re leasing of the square footage previously leased by these tenants may require considerable capital expenditures and an indeterminate period of time 
losses of our larger tenants and our inability to re lease vacated properties on favorable terms could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
a significant portion of our base rent is generated by properties in california  and our business could be harmed by an economic downturn in the california real estate market or a significant earthquake 
as of december   approximately of our total annualized base rent was generated by our properties located in the state of california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  a downturn in the performance of the commercial real estate markets and the local economies in various areas within california could adversely affect the value of these properties and the rental income from these properties and  in turn  our results of operations 
in addition  the geographic concentration of our properties in california in close proximity to regions known for their seismic activity exposes us to the risk that our operating results could be harmed by a significant earthquake 
future declines in the demand for commercial space in the greater san francisco bay area could harm our results of operations and  consequently  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
approximately of our net operating income  including income from discontinued operations  for the year ended december  was generated by our properties located in the greater san francisco bay area 
as a result  our business is somewhat dependent on the condition of the san francisco bay area economy 
the market for commercial space in the san francisco bay area is recovering from of one of the most severe downturns of the past several decades 
this downturn was precipitated by the unprecedented collapse of many technology and so called dot com businesses that  during the period  had been chiefly responsible for generating demand for  and increased prices of  local office properties 
this downturn has harmed  and may continue to harm  our results of operations 
in the event this downturn continues or economic conditions in the san francisco bay area worsen  it could harm the market value of our properties  the results derived from such properties and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
real estate investments are inherently risky  and many of the risks involved are beyond our ability to control 
real property investments are subject to numerous risks 
the yields available from an equity investment in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and costs incurred by the related properties 
if the properties in which we invest do not generate sufficient income to meet costs  including debt service  tenant improvements  third party leasing commissions  and capital expenditures  our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could suffer 
revenues and values of our properties may also be harmed by a number of other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the national economic climate  the local economic climate  local real estate conditions  including an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the attractiveness of our properties to tenants  competition from other available space  our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance to cover other operating costs  government regulations and changes in real estate  zoning or tax laws  and interest rate levels  the availability of financing  and potential liabilities under environmental and other laws 
if our tenants experience financial difficulty or seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  our cash from operating activities could suffer 
our commercial tenants may  from time to time  experience downturns in their business operations and finances due to adverse economic conditions  which may result in their failure to make rental payments to us on a timely basis or at all 
missed rental payments  in the aggregate  could impair our cash flows and  as a result  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
at any time  a tenant could seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which might result in the modification or termination of the tenant s lease and cause a reduction in our cash flow 
during the twelve months ended december   none of our tenants had filed for bankruptcy 
however  in the event of default by or bankruptcy of a tenant  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
the default  bankruptcy  or insolvency of a few major tenants may harm us and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
our dependence on smaller businesses to rent office space could negatively affect our cash flow 
many of the tenants in our properties operate smaller businesses that may not have the financial strength of larger corporate tenants 
smaller companies generally experience a higher rate of failure and are generally more susceptible to financial risks than large  well capitalized enterprises 
dependence on these companies could create a higher risk of tenant defaults  turnover  and bankruptcies  all of which could harm our ability to pay dividends 
the acquisition and development of real estate is subject to numerous risks  and the cost of bringing any acquired property to standards for its intended market position could exceed our estimates 
a significant portion of our leases is scheduled to expire in to supplement the losses in net operating income caused by the leasing turnover  we expanded our acquisitions program in and during the first ten months of acquisitions totaled approximately million in and million in the goal of our acquisitions program was to purchase additional properties the net operating income from which would supplement the declines in net operating income we have been experiencing  and will experience  from rental declines and from our high tenant turnover rate in and due to the fact that we were unable to acquire sufficient properties that met our targets for return on investment  we determined that we would de emphasize our acquisitions program and focus  instead  on selling individual properties in the current seller favorable market in order to supplement our net operating income 
however  following the conclusion of our review of strategic alternatives  and as part of repositioning ourselves as a multi tenant reit  we may acquire additional properties as opportunities arise 
we may acquire industrial and suburban office properties and portfolios of these properties  which may include the acquisition of other companies and business entities owning the properties 
although we engage in due diligence review for each new acquisition  we may not be aware of all potential liabilities and problems associated with a property 
we may have limited contractual recourse  or no contractual recourse  against the sellers of a property 
we may abandon development opportunities resulting in direct expenses to us 
from time to time  we may invest significant time and resources exploring development opportunities that we subsequently decide are not in our best interest 
the costs of investigating these opportunities will still be considered a direct expense and may harm our financial condition 
our uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a loss in value of our properties 
we currently maintain general liability coverage with primary limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  as well as million of umbrella excess liability coverage 
this coverage protects us against liability claims as well as the cost of legal defense 
we carry property all risks insurance of million on a replacement value basis covering both the cost of direct physical damage and the loss of rental income 
separate flood and earthquake insurance is provided with an annual aggregate limit of million  subject to a deductible of the greater of  or of total insurable value per building and respective rent loss with respect to earthquake coverage 
additional excess earthquake coverage with an aggregate limit of million is provided for properties located in california  which represent approximately of our portfolio s annualized base rent as of december  some losses  including those due to acts of war  nuclear accidents  pollution  mold  or terrorism  may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
however  we do presently carry insurance for terrorism losses as defined under the terrorism risk insurance act of under our all risks property policies  liability policies  primary and umbrella excess policies 
in addition  non certified terrorism coverage is provided under our property policy for losses in excess of million up to the million limit 
some losses could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or could cause us to bear a substantial portion of those losses due to deductibles under those policies 
if we suffer an uninsured loss  we could lose both our invested capital in and anticipated cash flow from the property while being obligated to repay any outstanding indebtedness incurred to acquire the property 
in addition  a majority of our properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity 
although we have obtained earthquake insurance policies for all of our properties  if one or more properties sustain damage as a result of an earthquake  we may incur substantial losses up to the amount of the deductible under the earthquake insurance policy and  additionally  to the extent that the damage exceeds the policy s maximum coverage  we would not have insurance compensation for that portion of the losses 
although we have obtained owner s title insu rance policies for each of our properties  the title insurance may be in an amount less than the current market value of some of the properties 
if a title defect results in a loss that exceeds insured limits  we could lose all or part of our investment in  and anticipated gains  if any  from  the property 
furthermore  the current insurance market is characterized by rising premium rates  increasing deductibles  and more restrictive coverage language 
continued increases in the costs of insurance coverage or increased limits or exclusions in insurance policy coverage could negatively affect our financial results 
if we fail to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust  we could experience adverse tax and other consequences  including the loss of deductibility of dividends in calculating our taxable income and the imposition of federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
we have elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections to of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner so as to have satisfied the reit qualification requirements since however  the irs could challenge our qualification as a reit for taxable years still subject to audit  and we may fail to qualify as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex tax provisions  and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may have an impact on our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we cannot assure that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations  or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
we are not aware of any proposal to amend the tax laws that would significantly and negatively affect our ability to continue to operate as a reit 
if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit  or are found not to have qualified as a reit for any prior year  we would not be entitled to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders and would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  unless entitled to statutory relief  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
this treatment would reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of any additional tax liability for the year or years involved 
in addition  we would no longer be required by the internal revenue code to make any distributions 
as a result  disqualification as a reit would harm us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
to the extent that distributions to stockholders have been ma de in anticipation of our qualification as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate investments to pay the applicable tax 
we must comply with strict income distribution requirements to maintain favorable tax treatment as a reit 
if our cash flow is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and the distribution requirements  we may need to incur additional borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to satisfy these requirements 
to maintain reit status  we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we are subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any amount of such income not distributed in prior years 
although we anticipate that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses and meet the distribution requirements  we cannot assure you that this will occur  and we may need to incur borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to satisfy the distribution requirements associated with maintaining the reit qualification 
in addition  differences in timing between the receipt of income and payment of expenses in arriving at our taxable income could require us to incu r borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to meet the distribution requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow funds or otherwise obtain funds if and when necessary to satisfy these requirements 
as a reit  we are subject to complex constructive ownership rules that limit any holder to in value of our outstanding common and preferred stock  taken together 
any shares transferred in violation of this rule are subject to redemption by us and any such transaction is voidable 
to maintain reit qualification  our charter provides that no holder is permitted to own more than in value of our outstanding common and preferred stock  taken together  or more than in value or number of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  no holder is permitted to own any shares of any class of our stock if that ownership would cause more than in value of our outstanding common and preferred stock  taken together  to be owned by five or fewer individuals  would result in our stock being beneficially owned by less than persons or would otherwise result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
acquisition or ownership of our common or preferred stock in violation of these restrictions results in automatic transfer of the stock to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary or  under specified circumstances  the violative transfer may be deemed void or we may choose to redeem the violative shares 
peter b 
bed ford is subject to higher ownership limitations than our other stockholders 
specifically  mr 
bedford is not permitted to own more than of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
the ownership limitations described above are applied using the constructive ownership rules of the internal revenue code 
these rules are complex and may cause common or preferred stock owned beneficially or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of our outstanding common or preferred stock or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns our common or preferred stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to constructively own stock in excess of the limits and subject that stock to the ownership restrictions in our charter 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud 
we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls 
these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements  modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable 
while management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls including collusion  management override  and breakdowns in human judgment 
because of this  control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price 
we rely on the services of our key personnel  and their expertise and knowledge of our business would be difficult to replace 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our senior officers 
while we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could harm our business 
on april   our board of directors announced that they had launched a search to replace peter bedford as our c hief e xecutive o fficer upon his retirement 
after conducting this search for several months and as a result of subsequent developments in the real estate market  in september  the board of directors determined that it would be in the best interests of our stockholders to pursue various strategic alternatives  including a possible sale or merger of our company to a third party or selling certain of our assets 
based on this shift in strategy  the board requested  and peter bedford agreed  to defer his retirement and remain as our ceo while we evaluated and pursued these strategic alternatives 
in connection with the board s conclusion of its review of strategic alternatives in february  the board decided to discontinue its previously suspended search for a successor candidate to serve as ceo and peter bedford s term of employment as ceo was extended until december  in addition  james moore  our president and former c hief o perating o fficer  has also announced his intention to retire in july as a result  we have restructured our organization and stephen m 
silla has assumed the position of c hief o perating o fficer  effective january  changes in our senior management and any future departures of key employees or other members of senior management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and on our results of operations 
the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive  and we compete with companies  including reits  that may be able to purchase properties at lower capitalization rates than would be accretive for us 
we have historically sought to grow our asset base through the acquisition of industrial and suburban office properties and portfolios of these properties  as well as through the development of new industrial and suburban office properties 
many real estate companies  including other reits  compete with us in making bids to acquire new properties 
the level of competition to acquire income producing properties is largely measured by the capitalization rates at which properties are trading 
the capitalization rate is the annual yield that property produces on the investment 
currently  capitalization rates are low due to the amount of capital available for investment and attractive debt financing terms 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with companies  including reits  that may be able to purchase properties at lower capitalization rates than would be accretive for us 
many of our properties are located in markets with an oversupply of space  and our ability to compete effectively with other properties to attract tenants may be limited to the extent that competing properties may be newer  better capitalized or in more desirable locations than our properties 
numerous industrial and suburban office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants 
some of these competing properties are newer  better located  or better capitalized than our properties 
many of our investments are located in markets that have a significant supply of available space  resulting in intense competition for tenants and lower rents 
we believe the oversupply of available space relative to demand has increased in recent years due to the softened us economy 
the number of competitive properties in a particular area could negatively impact our ability to lease space in the properties or at newly acquired or developed properties 
we could incur costs from environmental liabilities even though we did not cause  contribute to  or know about them 
under various federal  state  and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances released on  above  under or in a property 
these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  environmental laws often impose liability on a previous owner of property for hazardous or toxic substances present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property may not relieve an owner of all liability 
accordingly  we could be liable for properties previously sold or otherwise divested 
the costs of removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of the substances  or the failure to properly remove them  may harm our ability to borrow using the real estate as collateral 
all of our properties have had phase i environmental site assessments  which involve inspection without soil sampling or groundwater analysis  by independent environmental consultants and have been inspected for hazardous materials as part of our acquisition inspections 
none of the phase i assessments has revealed any environmental problems requiring material costs for clean up 
the phase i assessment for milpitas town center  however  indicates that the groundwater under that property either has been or may in the future be  impacted by the migration of contaminants originating off site 
according to information available to us  the responsible party for this offsite source has been identified and has begun clean up 
we do not believe that this environmental matter will impair the future value of milpitas town center in any significant respect or that we will be required to fund any portion of the cost of remediation 
we cannot assure you  however  that these phase i assessments or our inspections have revealed all environmental liabilities and problems relating to this or any other of our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state  and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
to date  compliance with federal  state  and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on us 
however  we cannot assure you that costs relating to the investigation and remediation of environmental issues for properties currently or previously owned by us  or properties that we may acquire in the future  or other expenditures or liabilities  including claims by private parties  resulting from hazardous substances present in  on  under  or above the properties or resulting from circumstances or other actions or claims relating to environmental matters  will not harm us and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be significant 
concern about indoor exposure to mold  fungi  and mycotoxins has been increasing because this exposure is allegedly linked to various adverse effects on health 
increasingly  insurance companies are excluding mold related risks from their policy coverage  and it is now excluded from our coverage 
costs and potential liability stemming from tenant exposure to mold and the increased costs of renovating and remodeling buildings with exposure to mold could harm our financial position and results 
we have in the past incurred costs for mold remediation in certain of our properties and may incur such costs in the future 
we could incur unanticipated costs to comply with the americans with disabilities act  and any non compliance could result in fines 
under the americans with disabilities act the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada requires removal of access barriers  and any non compliance may result in the imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  in the future we may incur costs to comply with the ada with respect to both existing properties and properties acquired in the future  which could limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we are subject to numerous federal  state  and local regulatory requirements  and any changes to existing regulations or new laws may result in significant  unanticipated costs 
our properties are  and any properties we may acquire in the future will be  subject to various other federal  state  and local regulatory requirements  including local building codes 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements  although expenditures at properties owned by us may be necessary to comply with changes in these laws 
although no material expenditures are contemplated at this time to comply with any laws or regulations  we cannot assure you that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us  which could harm us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the p otential liability for environmental conditions existing on our properties could result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
our million credit agreement and our mortgage loans are collateralized by approximately of our total real estate assets  and in the event of default under any of these debt instruments  our lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing this indebtedness 
as of december   our million credit facility was collateralized by mortgages on properties that accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent and approximately of our total real estate assets 
all of our mortgage loans were collateralized by properties that accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent and approximately of our total real estate assets 
if we fail to meet our obligations under the credit facility  the mortgage loans  or any other debt instruments we may enter into from time to time  including failure to comply with financial covenants  the holders of this indebtedness generally would be entitled to demand immediate repayment of the principal and to foreclose upon any collateral securing this indebtedness 
in addition  default under or acceleration of any debt instrument could  pursuant to cross default clauses  cause or permit the acceleration of other indebtedness 
any defa ult or acceleration would harm us  jeopardizing our qualification as a reit and threatening our continued viability 
in addition  upon the sale of any property subject to a mortgage loan or which forms part of the collateral for our credit facility  we would be required to apply the proceeds of any such sale first to pay off any mortgage loan on the property or to the extent the total value of the collateral securing our credit facility after such sale is less than the total amount outstanding under the credit facility to pay down our credit facility  as applicable 
our million credit agreement and some of our mortgage loans carry floating interest rates  and increases in market interest rates could harm our results of operations 
as of december   our million credit facility did not have an outstanding balance 
however  the average outstanding balance during was million  and we had other outstanding floating rate loans of million as of december  borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  and we may from time to time incur or assume other indebtedness also bearing interest at a floating rate 
in that regard  our results of operations for and have benefited from low levels of interest rates 
should this trend in interest rates reverse itself  our operating results could be harmed 
we use borrowings to finance the acquisition  development and operation of properties and to repurchase our common stock  and we cannot assure you that financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  in the future 
we borrow money to pay for the acquisition  development  and operation of our properties  to repurchase our common stock  and for other general corporate purposes 
our credit facility currently expires on march   when the principal amount of all outstanding borrowings must be paid 
since the term of our credit facility is limited  our ability to fund acquisitions and provide funds for working capital and other cash needs following the expiration or utilization of the credit facility will depend primarily on our ability to obtain additional private or public equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  at the time we may require such financing 
a downturn in the economy could make it difficult for us to borrow money on favorable terms 
if we are unable to borrow money on favorable terms  we may need to sell some of our assets at unfavorable prices in order to pay our loans 
we could encounter several problems  including insufficient cash flow to meet required payments of principal and interest  an increase on variable interest rates on indebtedness  and an inability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 
our leverage could harm our ability to operate our business and fulfill our debt obligations 
we have significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total liabilities of approximately million  excluding unused commitments under our credit facility  and total stockholders equity of approximately million 
payments to service our outstanding debt obligations during the year totaled approximately million for our debt level increases the possibility that we could be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on  or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur additional debt from time to time to fund our stock buy back program  finance strategic acquisitions  investments  or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments 
we have not used derivatives extensively to mitigate our interest rate risks 
historically  we have not used interest rate swaps  caps and floors  or other derivative transactions extensively to help us mitigate our interest rate risks because we have determined that the cost of these transactions outweighed their potential benefits and could have  in some cases  jeopardized our status as a reit 
we have entered into a swap agreement to hedge our exposure to the variable interest rate on a mortgage with a remaining principal balance of approximately million as of december  even if we were to use derivative transactions more extensively  we would not be fully insulated from the prepayment and interest rate risks to which we are exposed 
however  we do not have any policy that prohibits us from using derivative transactions or other hedging strategies more extensively in the future 
if we do engage in additional derivative transactions in the future  we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will e xist for any instruments purchased or sold in those transactions  and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
an increase in market interest rates could cause the respective prices of our common stock and preferred stock to decrease 
one of the factors that may influence the respective market prices of our shares of common stock and preferred stock will be the annual dividend yield on the price paid for shares of our common stock or preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments  which may adversely affect the respective market prices of our common stock and preferred stock 
as of december   interest rates in the us remained relatively low 
we may incur additional indebtedness  which may harm our financial position and cash flow and potentially impact our ability to pay dividends 
our existing debt instruments permit us to incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities  subject to the restrictions contained in those debt instruments 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding 
we may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged  which could harm our financial position and potentially limit our cash available to pay dividends 
as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our dividend obligations relating to our preferred stock or pay dividends on our common stock  if we assume additional indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends regularly although we have done so in the past 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations 
although we have done so in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in the future 
furthermore  any new shares of common stock issued will substantially increase the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels 
any common stock or preferred stock that may in the future be issued to finance acquisitions  upon exercise of stock options or otherwise would have a similar effect 
in addition  our existing credit facility covenants have specific limits regarding our ability to pay quarterly dividends to stockholders 
our ability to pay dividends is further limited by the requirements of maryland law 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is further limited by the laws of maryland 
under the maryland general corporation law  a maryland corporation may not make a distribution if  after giving effect to the distribution  either the corporation would not be able to pay indebtedness of the corporation as the indebtedness becomes due in the usual course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of the corporation s total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
accordingly  we cannot make a distribution  except by dividend  on our common stock or preferred stock if  after giving effect to the distribution  our total assets would be less than the sum of our l iabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of any shares of preferred stock then outstanding  or if we would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it became due 
financial performance our funds from operations ffo during the three and twelve months ended december  was  and  respectively 
during the same periods in  ffo was  and  respectively 
although ffo is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we believe that ffo may be an appropriate alternative measure of the performance of an equity reit 
presentation of this information provides the reader with an additional measure to compare the performance of equity reits 
ffo is generally defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items and gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we computed our ffo in accordance with this definition 
ffo doe s not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
furthermore  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our presentation 
the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to ffo is net income available to common stockholders 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the differences between our ffo and our net income available to common stockholders for each of the three and twelve months ended december  and three months ended december  twelve months ended december  funds from operations in thousands  except share amounts net income available to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations gain on sales of operating properties funds from operations weighted average number of shares diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we balance our borrowings between fixed and variable rate debt 
while we have in the past entered into interest swap agreements from time to time to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we monitor our interest rate risk using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average annual interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in thousands twelve month period ending december  thereafter total fair value variable rate debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase by  or an average of basis points  interest expense on our outstanding variable rate debt would increase by approximately  annually 
in july  we entered into an interest swap agreement with bank of america  na on our two floating rate mortgages with security life of denver insurance company 
the agreement  which commenced on july  and terminates on september   exchanges a floating rate of day libor for a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million for the first months and million in as a result of the paydown of a portion of one of the mortgages and the pay off of the other mortgage in december  the agreement was amended to reduce the notional amount to million with no other term changes 
interest rate pay differentials that arise under this swap agreement are recognized on an accrual basis in interest expense over the term of the contract 
this interest rate swap agreement was considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the mortgages 
the following summarizes the notional value and fair value of our interest swap contract 
the notional value below provides an indication of the amount that has been hedged in this contract but does not represent an obligation or exposure to credit risk at december  dollars in thousands notional amount fixed rate contract maturity cumulative cash paid  net fair value of derivative financial instrument at december  september  to determine the fair values of derivative instruments in accordance with sfas  we use the discounted cash flow method  which requires the use of assumptions about market conditions and risks existing at the balance sheet date 
judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of market value 
accordingly  estimated fair value is a general approximation of value  and such value may or may not actually be realized
