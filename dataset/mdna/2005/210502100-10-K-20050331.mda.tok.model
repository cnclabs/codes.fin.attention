overview consumer portfolio services  inc cps  and together with its subsidiaries  the company is a consumer finance company which specializes in purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment purchase contracts contracts originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers dealers in the sale of new and used automobiles  light trucks and passenger vans 
through its purchases  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers for borrowers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems sub prime customers 
the company serves as an alternative source of financing for dealers  allowing sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing 
the company does not lend money directly to consumers 
rather  it purchases installment contracts from dealers based on its financing programs the cps programs 
on march   the company acquired mfn financial corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger the mfn merger 
on may   the company acquired tfc enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries in a second merger the tfc merger 
each merger was accounted for as a purchase 
mfn financial corporation and its subsidiaries mfn and tfc enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries tfc were engaged in businesses similar to that of the company buying contracts from dealers  repackaging those contracts in securitization transactions  and servicing those contracts 
mfn ceased acquiring contracts in may  tfc continues to acquire contracts under its tfc programs  which provide financing for vehicle purchases exclusively by members of the united states armed forces 
on april   the company purchased in the seawest asset acquisition a portfolio of contracts and certain other assets from seawest financial corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  seawest 
in addition  the company was named the successor servicer of three term securitization transactions originally sponsored by seawest the seawest third party portfolio 
the company does not intend to offer financing programs similar to those previously offered by seawest 
the company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  interest earned on residuals  as defined below  and interest on finance receivables 
during the years ended december  and  the company sold some contracts on a servicing released basis  as part of a program the flow purchase program in which the company sold contracts to unaffiliated third parties immediately after purchasing such contracts from dealers 
the flow purchase program ended in may during the years ended december  and  the company s gain on sale of contracts included million and million  respectively  representing mark up on contracts sold in the flow purchase program 
securitization generally throughout the periods for which information is presented in this report  the company has purchased contracts with the intention of repackaging them in securitizations 
all such securitizations have involved identification of specific contracts  sale of those contracts and associated rights to a special purpose subsidiary of the company  and issuance of asset backed securities to fund the transactions 
depending on the structure of the securitization  the transaction may properly be accounted for as a sale of the contracts  or as a secured financing 
when structured to be treated as a secured financing  the subsidiary is consolidated with the company 
accordingly  the sold contracts and the related securitization trust debt appear as assets and liabilities  respectively  of the company on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company then periodically i recognizes interest and fee income on the receivables ii recognizes interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization  and iii records as expense a provision for credit losses on the receivables 
when structured to be treated as a sale  the subsidiary is not consolidated with the company 
accordingly  the securitization removes the sold contracts from the company s consolidated balance sheet  the asset backed securities debt of the non consolidated subsidiary do not appear as debt of the company  and the company shows  as an asset  a retained residual interest in the sold contracts 
the residual interest represents the discounted value of what the company expects will be the excess of future collections on the contracts over principal and interest due on the asset backed securities 
that residual interest appears on the company s consolidated balance sheet as residual interest in securitizations  and the determination of its value is dependent on estimates of the future performance of the sold contracts 
change in policy in august  the company announced that it would structure its future securitization transactions related to contracts purchased under the cps programs to be reflected as secured financings for financial accounting purposes 
its six subsequent term securitizations of such finance receivables have been so structured 
prior to august  the company had structured its term securitization transactions related to the cps programs to be treated as sales for financial accounting purposes 
in the mfn merger and in the tfc merger the company acquired finance receivables that had been previously securitized in term securitization transactions that were reflected as secured financings 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included net finance receivables of approximately million and securitization trust debt of million related to finance receivables acquired in the two mergers  out of totals of net finance receivables of approximately million and securitization trust debt of approximately million 
credit risk retained whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes  the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to the company if the credit performance of the securitized contracts falls short of pre determined standards 
such releases represent a material portion of the cash that the company uses to fund its operations 
an unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both the company s liquidity and its results of operations  regardless of whether such contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed 
for estimation of the magnitude of such risk  it may be appropriate to look to the size of the company s managed portfolio  which represents both financed and sold contracts as to which such credit risk is retained 
the company s managed portfolio as of december  was approximately million this amount includes million related to the seawest third party portfolio on which the company earns only servicing fees and has no credit risk 
critical accounting policies the company believes that its accounting policies related to a allowance for finance credit losses  b residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts and c income taxes could be considered critical 
such policies are described below 
a allowance for finance credit losses in order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables  the company uses a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as static pooling  which stratifies its finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools 
using analytical and formula driven techniques  the company estimates an allowance for finance credit losses  which management believes is adequate for probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in its portfolio of finance receivable contracts 
provision for loss is charged to the company s consolidated statement of operations 
net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies  the characteristics of the portfolio and the value of the underlying collateral 
as conditions change  the company s level of provisioning and or allowance may change as well 
b treatment of securitizations gain on sale may be recognized on the disposition of contracts either outright or in securitization transactions 
in those securitization transactions that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes  the company  or a wholly owned  consolidated subsidiary of the company  retains a residual interest in the contracts that were sold to a wholly owned  unconsolidated special purpose subsidiary 
the company s securitization transactions include term securitizations the purchaser holds the contracts for substantially their entire term and continuous or warehouse securitizations which finance the acquisition of the contracts for future sale into term securitizations 
as of december  and the line item residual interest in securitizations on the company s consolidated balance sheet represents the residual interests in certain term securitizations that were accounted for as sales 
warehouse securitizations accounted for as secured financings are accordingly reflected in the line items finance receivables and warehouse lines of credit on the company s consolidated balance sheet  and the term securitizations accounted for as secured financings are reflected in the line items finance receivables and securitization trust debt 
the residual interest in securitizations represents the discounted sum of expected future releases from securitization trusts 
accordingly  the valuation of the residual is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance 
the key economic assumptions used in measuring all residual interests in securitizations as of december  and are included in the table below 
the company has used an effective pre tax discount rate of per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to the company s securitizations in and later  where the company has used a discount rate of per annum 
prepayment speed cumulative net credit losses cumulative key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows december  dollars in thousands carrying amount fair value of residual interest in securitizations  weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  expected net credit losses cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  residual cash flows discount rate annual estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on and percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses  which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
the company s securitization structure has generally been as follows the company sells contracts it acquires to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to another entity  typically a statutory trust trust 
the trust issues interest bearing asset backed securities notes  in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the notes issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the notes are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company may retain or sell subordinated notes issued by the trust or by a related entity 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior notes  from an insurance company a note insurer 
in addition  the company provides credit enhancement for the benefit of the note insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to a bank account spread account held by the trust  in the form of overcollateralization of the notes  where the principal balance of the notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts  in the form of subordinated notes  or some combination of such credit enhancements 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the securitization agreements require that the initial level of credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of credit enhancement reaches specified levels which are then maintained 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts 
the specified levels at which the credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the note insurers and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios  and have also varied by securitization agreement 
the securitization agreements generally grant the company the option to repurchase the sold contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance 
the prior securitizations that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes differ from secured financings in that the trust to which the sps sold the contracts met the definition of a qualified special purpose entity under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
as a result  assets and liabilities of the trust are not consolidated into the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s warehouse securitization structures were similar to the above  except that i the sps that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes which it issues  ii the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than to of the aggregate principal balance of the contracts that is  at least overcollateralization  and iii no increase in the required amount of credit enhancement is contemplated unless certain portfolio performance tests are breached 
during the quarter ended september  the warehouse securitizations related to the cps programs were amended to cause the transactions to be treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes 
the contracts held by the warehouse spss and the promissory notes that they issue are therefore included in the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  and as assets and liabilities  respectively 
upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing  whether a term securitization or a warehouse securitization  the company retains on its consolidated balance sheet the contracts securitized as assets and records the notes issued in the transaction as indebtedness of the company 
under the prior securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  the company removed from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts sold and added to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received  if any  and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in contracts sold in the securitization 
that retained or residual interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account  if any  b overcollateralization  if any  c subordinated notes retained  if any  and d receivables from trust  which include the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the notes  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
until the maturity of these transactions  the company s consolidated balance sheet will reflect both securitization transactions structured as sales and others structured as secured financings 
with respect to securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the notes sold and the residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount of anticipated cash flows that it estimates will be released to the company in the future the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
the anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables 
the company has used an effective pre tax discount rate of per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to the company s securitizations in and later where the company has used a discount rate of per annum the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the notes  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
required principal payments on the notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts excluding those contracts that have been charged off  or a pre determined percentage of such balance 
where that percentage is less than  the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the notes is reduced to the specified percentage 
such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the notes 
if the amount of cash required for payment of fees  interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account  if any 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or other form of credit enhancement  the excess is released to the company  or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts related to transactions insured by the same note insurer that may be below their required levels 
if the total credit enhancement amount is not at the required level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved 
although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company s sps as the owner of the residuals in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes or the trusts in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes  the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the securitization agreements 
the interest rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the notes 
as a result  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults  default loss severity  and recovery rates  as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
as of december   the company used prepayment estimates of approximately to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
the company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data 
in valuing the residuals as of december   the company estimates that charge offs as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to of the original principal balance 
following a securitization that is structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes  interest income is recognized on the balance of the residuals at the same rate as used for calculating the present value of the nirs  which is per annum 
in addition  the company will recognize as a gain additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts is better than the company s estimate of the value of the residual 
if the actual performance of the contracts were worse than the company s estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals and a related impairment charge would be required 
in a securitization structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes  interest income is recognized when accrued under the terms of the related contracts and  therefore  presents less potential for fluctuations in performance when compared to the approach used in a transaction structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes 
in all the company s term securitizations  whether treated as secured financings or as sales  the company has sold the receivables through a subsidiary to the securitization trust 
the difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings the company reports the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on its consolidated balance sheet 
under both structures the noteholders and the related securitization trusts have no recourse to the company for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis 
the company s residuals  however  are subordinate to the notes until the noteholders are fully paid  and the company is therefore at risk to that extent 
c income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income and combined state franchise tax returns 
the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely 
in determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets  future taxable income from the following sources are considered a the reversal of taxable temporary differences  b future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences  and c tax planning strategies that  if necessary  would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire

results of operations acquisitions the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations as of and for the years ended december   and include the results of operations of mfn financial corporation for the period subsequent to march   the date on which the company acquired that corporation and its subsidiaries in the mfn merger 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  acquisition of mfn financial corporation 
the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations as of and for the year ended december  and include the results of operations of tfc enterprises  inc for the period subsequent to may   the date on which the company acquired that corporation and its subsidiaries in the tfc merger 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  acquisition of tfc enterprises  inc effects of change in securitization structure the company s decision in the third quarter of to structure securitization transactions as borrowings secured by receivables for financial accounting purposes  rather than as sales of receivables  has affected and will affect the way in which the transactions are reported 
the major effects are these i the finance receivables are shown as assets of the company on its balance sheet  ii the debt issued in the transactions is shown as indebtedness of the company  iii cash deposited to enhance the credit of the securitization transactions spread accounts is shown as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet  iv cash collected from borrowers and other sources related to the receivables prior to making the required payments under the securitization agreements is also shown as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet  v the servicing fee that the company receives in connection with such receivables is recorded as a portion of the interest earned on such receivables in the company s statements of operations  vi the company has initially and periodically recorded as expense a provision for estimated credit losses on the receivables in the company s statements of operations  and vii of scheduled payments on the receivables and on the debt issued in the transactions  the portion representing interest is recorded as interest income and expense  respectively  in the company s statements of operations 
these changes collectively represent a deferral of revenue and acceleration of expenses  and thus a more conservative approach to accounting for the company s operations compared to the previous term securitization transactions  which were accounted for as sales at the consummation of the transaction 
the changes have resulted in the company s reporting lower earnings than it would have reported if it had continued to structure its securitizations to require recognition of gain on sale 
as a result  reported earnings have been less than they would have been had the company continued to structure its securitizations to record a gain on sale 
it should also be noted that growth in the company s portfolio of receivables in excess of current expectations would result in an increase in expenses in the form of provision for credit losses  and would initially have a negative effect on net earnings 
the company s cash availability and cash requirements should be unaffected by the change in structure 
the company has conducted six term securitizations of contracts originated under the cps programs structured as secured financings 
these securitizations were completed in the following periods september  december  may  august  september and december in march  the company completed a securitization of its retained interest in eight securitization transactions previously sponsored by the company and its affiliates  which was also structured as a secured financing 
in addition  in june  the company completed a term securitization of contracts purchased in the seawest asset acquisition and under the tfc programs  which was structured as a secured financing 
the company s mfn and tfc subsidiaries completed term securitizations structured as secured financings prior to their becoming subsidiaries of the company 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
during the year ended december   revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year revenue of million 
the primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary reasons for the increase in interest income are the change in securitization structure implemented during the third quarter of as described above an increase of million and the interest income earned on the portfolios of contracts acquired in the tfc merger an increase of million and the seawest asset acquisition an increase of million 
this increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger resulting in a decrease of million in interest income and a decrease in residual interest income a decrease of million 
the increase in interest income is offset in part by the elimination of net gain on sale of contracts revenue and a decrease in servicing fees 
as a result of the change in securitization structure  zero net gain on sale of contracts was recorded in  compared to million net gain on sale in the year earlier period 
servicing fees totaling million in the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the same period a year earlier 
the decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries 
the decrease was partially offset by the servicing fees earned on the seawest third party portfolio  which totaled million 
as a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings  the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods  and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately 
as of december  and  the company s managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs 
non consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows december  december  amount amount total managed portfolio in millions owned by consolidated subsidiaries owned by non consolidated subsidiaries seawest third party portfolio total at december   the company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million this amount includes million related to the seawest third party portfolio on which the company earns only servicing fees  compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million as of december  as the portfolios of contracts acquired in the mfn merger and the tfc merger decrease  the portfolio of contracts originated under the cps programs continues to expand

the company s operating expenses consist primarily of employee costs and other operating expenses  which are incurred as applications and contracts are received  processed and serviced 
factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments  and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level 
employee costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options  and are one of the company s most significant operating expenses 
these costs other than those relating to stock options generally fluctuate with the level of applications and contracts processed and serviced 
other operating expenses consist primarily of interest expense  provisions for credit losses  facilities expenses  telephone and other communication services  credit services  computer services including employee costs associated with information technology support  professional services  marketing and advertising expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
total operating expenses were million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in the provision for credit losses to million during the period as compared to million in the period 
increased interest expense was also significant 
employee costs increased to million during  representing of total operating expenses  from million for  or of total operating expenses 
the slight increase is primarily the result of staff additions related to increased contract purchases in an increase of million 
this increase was partially offset by staff reductions since the mfn merger in related to the integration and consolidation of certain service and administrative activities and the decline in the balance of the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger a decrease of million 
the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses  primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense 
general and administrative expenses remained essentially unchanged at million  or of total operating expenses  in  as compared to million  or of total operating expenses  in the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the provision for credit losses and interest expense 
interest expense for increased million  or  to million  compared to million in the increase is primarily the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
such debt increased as a result of the change in securitization structure implemented beginning in july  the tfc merger in may and the seawest asset acquisition in april a combined increase of approximately million  partially offset by the decrease in the balance of the securitization trust debt acquired in the mfn merger resulting in a decrease of approximately million in interest expense 
impairment loss increased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in such impairment loss relates to the company s analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the company s previously securitized pools that are held by non consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations 
the impairment loss is a result of the actual net loss and prepayment rates exceeding the company s previous estimates for the contracts held by non consolidated subsidiaries 
marketing expenses increased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in contracts purchased by the company during the year ended december  occupancy expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to the closure and sub leasing during of certain facilities acquired in the mfn merger and the tfc merger 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  to  from million 
no income tax benefit was recorded in as compared to million recorded in periods 
the benefit is primarily the result of the resolution of certain internal revenue service examinations of previously filed mfn tax returns  resulting in a tax benefit of million  and other state tax matters resulting in a tax provision of million 
the company does not expect any comparable income tax benefit in future periods 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
during the year ended december   revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year revenue of million 
with the change in securitization structure and consequent end to recording gain on sale revenue in the third quarter of  net gain on sale of contracts decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in interest income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary reasons for the increase in interest income are the change in securitization structure an increase of million  the interest income earned on the portfolio of contracts acquired in the tfc merger an increase of million and an increase in residual interest income an increase of million 
this increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger resulting in a decrease of million in interest income 
servicing fees totaling million in the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the same period a year earlier 
the increase in servicing fees can be attributed to the growth of the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries related to the cps programs 
for the year ended december   the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries had an average outstanding principal balance approximating million  compared to million for the year ended december  at december   the company s managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries had an outstanding principal balance approximating million  compared to million as of december  as a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings  the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries will decline in future periods  and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately 
at december   the company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million  compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million as of december  as the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger amortizes  the portfolio of contracts originated under the cps and tfc programs continues to expand 
at december  and  the managed portfolio composition was as follows december  december  amount amount originating entity in millions cps tfc mfn total other income increased to million in from million in the period over period increase can be attributed in part to the receipt of state sales tax refunds of million during third quarter of and recoveries on previously charged off mfn contracts totaling million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of employee costs and other operating expenses  which are incurred as applications and contracts are received  processed and serviced 
factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments  macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level  and mix of business between contracts purchased on a flow basis and contracts purchased on an other than flow basis 
the company ceased to purchase contracts on a flow basis in may employee costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options  and are one of the company s most significant operating expenses 
these costs other than those relating to stock options generally fluctuate with the level of applications and contracts processed and serviced

total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in total operating expenses for the year ended december  would have been significantly lower except for the million provision for credit loss expense recorded during the third and fourth quarters of such provision for credit loss is a result of the decision to structure securitizations as financings  rather than as sales 
provisions for credit loss expense should be anticipated to increase in future periods 
employee costs decreased to million during the year ended december   representing of total operating expenses  compared to million for the period  or of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily the result of staff reductions since the mfn merger in related to the integration and consolidation of certain service and administrative activities and the decline in the balance of the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger a decrease of million 
this decrease was partially offset by staff additions related to the tfc merger in may an increase of million 
in connection with the termination of mfn origination activities and the integration and consolidation of certain activities see above related to the mfn merger and the tfc merger  the company has recognized certain liabilities related to the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of mfn and tfc 
these activities include service departments such as accounting  finance  human resources  information technology  administration  payroll and executive management 
such exit and termination costs have been charged against these liabilities and are not reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of total operating expenses  in the year ended december   from million  or of total operating expenses  in the same period of the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses is a result primarily of the change in securitization structure during the third quarter of which increased total expenses  and of continued general cost cutting during the period  offset in part by an increase in legal and other corporate expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december   decreased  or  to million in the slight decrease is the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet such debt related to the mfn merger declined as it was paid down a decrease of million  partially offset by the addition of securitization trust debt associated with the tfc merger an increase of million and with the securitizations subsequent to the company s change in securitization structure an increase of million 
as the company continues to structure future securitization transactions as secured financings  the balances of securitization trust debt and the related interest expense are expected to increase 
impairment loss decreased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in such impairment loss relates to the company s analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the company s previously securitized pools that are held by non consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations 
marketing expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in contracts purchased by the company during the year ended december  occupancy expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to the closure during of certain facilities acquired in the mfn merger 
the decrease was partially offset by the addition of facilities acquired in the tfc merger 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  to million from million 
income tax benefit of million and million was recorded in the and periods  respectively 
the benefit is primarily the result of the resolution of certain internal revenue service examinations of previously filed mfn tax returns  resulting in a tax benefit of million  and other state tax matters which have been included in the current period tax provision 
the benefit is due to tax legislation passed in early  which enabled the company to reverse a previously recorded valuation allowance of approximately million  as well as to record benefit during the same period 
the company does not expect any comparable income tax benefit in future periods 
extraordinary item 
the year ended december  included million of unallocated negative goodwill  which represented the difference between the net assets acquired and the purchase price paid by the company in connection with the mfn merger 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of contracts and other operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities  including proceeds from sales of contracts  amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties  customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables  fees for origination of contracts  and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of contracts in which the company has retained a residual ownership interest and from the spread accounts associated with such pools 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise  operating expenses such as employee  interest  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses  the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization  if any  and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions  and income taxes 
there can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the company s cash demands 
the sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and their related spread accounts  the rate of expansion or contraction in the company s managed portfolio  and the terms upon which the company is able to acquire  sell  and borrow against contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash from operating activities is generally provided by the net releases from the company s securitization trusts and from the amortization of contracts held for sale to non consolidated subsidiaries offset by the purchase of such contracts 
the decrease in vs 
is primarily a result of lower cash releases from the mfn trusts as the principal balance of the contracts in those two pools decreased significantly year over year 
the decrease in vs 
is primarily the result of the company s decision  in july  to treat all of its future securitizations as secured financings 
as a result includes no activity related to contracts held for sale 
on april   the company purchased a portfolio of contracts and certain other assets in the seawest asset acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  which was funded with the proceeds of an acquisition financing facility and existing cash 
on may   the company completed the tfc merger see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition cost was approximately million  and was substantially funded by existing cash 
on march   the company completed the mfn merger see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition cost was approximately million  and was substantially funded by existing cash and borrowings 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities has generally related to purchases of contracts  the cost of acquiring tfc and mfn and the purchase of furniture and equipment 
with the change in the securitization structure implemented in the third quarter of  million of contracts were purchased for investment in as compared to million in and none in cash used in the tfc merger  net of the cash acquired in the transaction  totaled million for the year ended december  cash used in the acquisition of mfn financial corporation  net of the cash acquired in the transaction  totaled million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   was million compared with million in and net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment or issuance of debt 
in connection with the tfc merger the company assumed securitization trust debt related to three securitization transactions held by consolidated subsidiaries see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and assumed additional subordinated debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the mfn merger the company assumed securitization trust debt related to one securitization transaction held by a consolidated subsidiary and one securitization transaction held by a non consolidated subsidiary see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and incurred additional senior secured debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment of outstanding debt 
with the change in the securitization structure implemented in the third quarter of  million of securitization trust debt was issued in as compared to million in and none in there can be no assurance that cash flows generated as a result of the seawest asset acquisition  the tfc merger and the mfn merger will be sufficient to meet the obligations assumed or incurred as a result of such transactions 
the sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of the securitized pools 
at the time of the tfc merger  tfc had outstanding million in principal amount of subordinated debt  which the company assumed as part of the tfc merger 
such debt bears interest at the rate of per annum payable monthly in arrears  requires monthly amortization  is due in june and has million outstanding at december  at the time of the mfn merger  mfn had outstanding million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt  which was due and repaid in full on march  such debt bore interest at the rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears 
contracts are purchased from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount  adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the contract purchase price  and generate cash flow over a period of years 
as a result  the company has been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase contracts  and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations  as well as to fund the portion of contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities 
as of december   the company had million in warehouse credit capacity  in the form of a million facility and a million facility 
the first facility provides funding for contracts purchased under the tfc programs while both warehouse facilities provide funding for contracts purchased under the cps programs 
a third facility in the amount of million  which the company utilized to fund contracts under the cps programs  expired on february  a fourth facility in the amount of million  which the company utilized to fund contracts under the tfc programs  expired on june  through may  the company s contract purchasing program consisted of both i flow purchases for immediate resale to non affiliates and ii purchases for the company s own account made on other than a flow basis  funded primarily by advances under a revolving warehouse credit facility 
flow purchases allowed the company to purchase contracts with minimal demands on liquidity 
the company s revenues from the resale of flow purchase contracts  however  were materially less than those that may be received by holding contracts to maturity or by selling contracts in securitization transactions 
during the years ended december  and the company purchased million and million  respectively  of contracts for its own account  compared to million for its own account and million of contracts on a flow basis in the company s flow purchase program ended in may the million warehouse facility is structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by cps warehouse trust 
this facility was established on march   in the maximum amount of million 
such maximum amount was increased to million in november up to of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one month commercial paper plus per annum 
this facility was renewed on april  and expires on april  the million warehouse facility is similarly structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its subsidiary page funding llc 
approximately of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one month libor plus per annum 
this facility was entered into on june  the lender has annual termination options at its sole discretion on each june through  at which time the agreement expires 
the million warehouse facility was similarly structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by cps funding llc 
approximately of the principal balance of contracts could be advanced to the company under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility accrued interest at a rate of one month libor plus per annum 
this facility expired on february  the million warehouse facility was similarly structured to allow tfc to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by tfc warehouse i llc 
approximately of the principal balance of contracts was advanced to tfc under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility accrued interest at a rate of one month libor plus per annum 
this facility expired on june  these facilities are independent of each other 
with the two currently existing facilities  two different financial institutions purchase the notes issued by these facilities  and two different insurers insure the notes each a note insurer 
the note insurer on the million facility is the controlling party whereas the lender on the million facility is the controlling party 
up through june   sales of contracts to the special purpose subsidiaries sps related to the first two facilities had been treated as sales for financial accounting purposes 
the company  therefore  removed these securitized contracts and related debt from its consolidated balance sheet and recognized a gain on sale in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
indebtedness related to contracts funded by the third facility  however  was retained on the company s consolidated balance sheet and no gain on sale has ever been recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
during july  each of the first two facilities was amended  with the effect that subsequent use of such facilities is treated for financial accounting purposes as borrowing secured by such receivables  rather than as a sale of receivables 
the effects of that amendment are similar to those discussed above with respect to the change in securitization structure 
the company securitized million of contracts in five private placement transactions during the year ended december  all of these transactions were structured as secured financings and  therefore  resulted in no gain on sale 
the company securitized million of contracts in four private placement transactions during the year ended december  the first two such transactions of were structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  resulting in a gain on sale of million net of a negative fair value adjustment of million related to the performance of previously securitized pools 
the final two transactions of were structured as secured financings and  therefore  resulted in no gain on sale 
the company securitized million of contracts in three private placement transactions during the year ended december  all of these transactions were structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  resulting in a gain on sale of million net of a pre tax charge of million related to the performance of previously securitized pools 
in march a wholly owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of the company issued million of asset backed notes secured by its retained interest in eight term securitization transactions 
the notes  which have an interest rate of per annum and a final maturity in october  are required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company incurred and capitalized issuance costs of million 
prior to june  the company also purchased contracts on a flow basis  which  as compared with purchases of contracts for the company s own account  involved a materially reduced demand on the company s cash 
the company s plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to match its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
for the portfolio owned by non consolidated subsidiaries  cash used to increase credit enhancement amounts to required levels for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash released from trusts and their related spread accounts to the company related to the portfolio owned by non consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
changes in the amount of credit enhancement required for term securitization transactions and releases from trusts and their related spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of contracts securitized that make up the company s managed portfolio to which the respective spread accounts are related 
during the year ended december  the company made no initial deposits to spread accounts and funded no initial overcollateralization related to its term securitization transactions owned by non consolidated subsidiaries  compared to million in the period and million in the period 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization  if any  and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than flow purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on securitized contracts 
the company is currently limited in its ability to purchase contracts due to certain liquidity constraints 
as of december   the company had cash on hand of million and available contract purchase commitments from its warehouse credit facilities of million 
the company s plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities  and matching its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the company will be able to complete term securitizations at all 
if the company is unable to complete such securitizations  interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease 
the company s primary means of ensuring that its cash demands do not exceed its cash resources is to match its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
the company s ability to adjust the quantity of contracts that it purchases and securitizes will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that the desired level of contract acquisition can be maintained or increased 
while the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions  the company s securitization agreements generally provide that the company will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and or the delinquency  defaults or net losses related to the contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels 
in the event delinquencies  defaults or net losses on the contracts exceed such levels  the terms of the securitization i may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool  ii may restrict the distribution to the company of excess cash flows associated with other pools  or iii in certain circumstances  may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the contracts to another servicer 
there can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash 
certain of the company s securitization transactions and the warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results 
such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels and maximum financial losses 
as a result of waivers and amendments to these covenants throughout and during the first quarter of  the company was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  without the waivers and amendments obtained in the first quarter of  the company would have been in breach of covenants related to maintaining a minimum level of net worth and incurring a maximum financial loss as of december  the servicing agreements of the company s securitization transactions and warehouse credit facilities are terminable by the insurers of certain of the trust s obligations note insurers in the event of certain defaults by the company and under certain other circumstances 
were a note insurer in the future to exercise its option to terminate the servicing agreements  such a termination would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
the company continues to receive servicer extensions on a monthly and or quarterly basis  pursuant to the servicing agreements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s material contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payment due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt    operating leases     securitization trust debt  in the aggregate amount of million as of december   is omitted from this table because it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced 
expected payments  which will depend on the performance of such receivables  as to which there can be no assurance  are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in long term debt includes senior secured  subordinated debt and notes payable 
credit facilities the terms on which credit has been available to the company for purchase of contracts have varied over the three year period ended december   as shown in the following recapitulation in november  the company through its subsidiary cps funding llc entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to collateral tests and other conditions 
the company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase contracts under the cps programs  which are pledged to secure the notes 
the collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the company to borrow up to approximately of the price paid for such contracts 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum

the balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at december  was zero 
capital resources prior to  and again in   and the company has funded increases in its managed portfolio through securitization transactions  as discussed above  and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and or equity 
as noted above   of long term debt matures prior to december  the company plans to repay its long term debt from a combination of the following the proceeds from a public offering of renewable notes  ii a possible transaction similar to the financing that it undertook in march where the company issued notes secured by its residual interests in securitizations  and iii possible senior secured financing similar to its existing outstanding senior secured financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete these transactions 
securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables  and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced 
although the securitization trust debt also has alternative maximum maturity dates  those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated  and at no time in the company s history have any of its sponsored asset backed securities reached those alternative maximum maturities 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization  if any  when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on securitized contracts 
the company plans to adjust its levels of contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts with its capital requirements

forward looking statements this report on form k includes certain forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the statements or implications to the effect that prepayments as a percentage of original balances will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  that charge offs as a percentage of original balances will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to of original principal balances 
other forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as anticipates  expects  plans  estimates  or words of like meaning 
as to the specifically identified forward looking statements  factors that could affect charge offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate  which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts  changes in laws respecting consumer finance  which could affect the ability of the company to enforce rights under contracts  and changes in the market for used vehicles  which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles 
factors that could affect the company s revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts  which would affect the company s ability to purchase contracts  the terms on which the company is able to finance such purchases  the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to the company on the terms that it offers  and the terms on which the company is able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired 
factors that could affect the company s expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel  and interest rates which affect the rates that the company pays on notes issued in its securitizations 
the statements concerning the company structuring future securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on the company s future profitability also are forward looking statements 
any change to the structure of the company s securitization transaction could cause such forward looking statements not to be accurate 
both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on the company s profitability and the duration of the period in which the company s profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates 
the accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which the company purchases and sells contracts  any changes in that rate  the credit performance of such contracts  the financial terms of future securitizations  any changes in such terms over time  and other factors that generally affect the company s profitability 
additional risk factors  any of which could have a material effect on the company s performance  are set forth below dependence on warehouse financing 
the company s primary source of day to day liquidity is continuous securitization of contracts  under which it sells or pledges contracts  as often as once a week  to either of two special purpose affiliated entities in the case of cps  or to one of the two special purpose affiliated entities in the case of tfc 
such transactions function as a warehouse  in which contracts are held 
the company expects to continue to effect similar transactions or to obtain replacement or additional financing as current arrangements expire or become fully utilized  however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
to the extent that the company is unable to maintain its existing structures or is unable to arrange new warehouse facilities  the company may have to curtail contract purchasing activities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
dependence on securitization program 
the company is dependent upon its ability to continue to finance pools of contracts in term securitizations in order to generate cash proceeds for new purchases 
adverse changes in the market for securitized contract pools  or a substantial lengthening of the warehousing period  would burden the company s financing capabilities  could require the company to curtail its purchase of contracts  and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  as a means of reducing the percentage of cash collateral that the company would otherwise be required to deposit and maintain in spread accounts and overcollateralization  all of the company s securitizations since june have utilized credit enhancement in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies issued by monoline financial guaranty insurers 
the company believes that financial guaranty insurance policies reduce the costs of securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancements available to the company 
no insurer is required to insure company sponsored securitizations and there can be no assurance that any will continue to do so 
similarly  there can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  any of which could cause substantial delays  including  without limitation  market conditions and the approval by all parties of the terms of the securitization 
risk of general economic downturn 
the company s business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles  which are affected by employment rates  prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions 
delinquencies  repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
because of the company s focus on sub prime customers  the actual rates of delinquencies  repossessions and losses on such contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general 
any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect the company s ability to sell or securitize pools of contracts 
the timing of any economic changes is uncertain  and sluggish sales of automobiles and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on the company s business and that of the dealers from which it purchases contracts 
dependence on performance of securitized contracts 
under the financial structures the company has used to date in its term securitizations  certain excess cash flows generated by the contracts sold in the term securitizations are used to increase overcollateralization or retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts to provide liquidity and credit enhancement 
while the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions  the company s securitization agreements generally provide that the company will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and or the delinquency  defaults or net losses related to the contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels 
in the event delinquencies  defaults or net losses on the contracts exceed such levels  the terms of the securitization i may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool  ii may restrict the distribution to the company of excess cash flows associated with other pools  or iii in certain circumstances  may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the contracts to another servicer 
any of these conditions could materially adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial condition 
creditworthiness of consumers 
the company specializes in the purchase  sale and servicing of contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub prime customers  which entail a higher risk of non performance  higher delinquencies and higher losses than contracts with more creditworthy customers 
while the company believes that the underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs enable it to control the higher risks inherent in contracts with sub prime customers  no assurance can be given that such criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks 
the company has experienced fluctuations in the delinquency and charge off performance of its contracts 
in the event that portfolios of contracts securitized and serviced by the company experience greater defaults  higher delinquencies or higher net losses than anticipated  the company s income could be negatively affected 
a larger number of defaults than anticipated could also result in adverse changes in the structure of the company s future securitization transactions  such as a requirement of increased cash collateral or other credit enhancement in such transactions 
probable increase in cost of funds 
the company s profitability is determined by  among other things  the difference between the rate of interest charged on the contracts purchased by the company and the rate of interest payable to purchasers of notes issued in securitizations 
the contracts purchased by the company generally bear finance charges close to or at the maximum permitted by applicable state law 
the interest rates payable on such notes are fixed  based on interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of sale 
consequently  increases in market interest rates tend to reduce the spread or margin between contract finance charges and the interest rates required by investors and  thus  the potential operating profits to the company from the purchase  securitization and servicing of contracts 
operating profits expected to be earned by the company on portfolios of contracts previously securitized are insulated from the adverse effects of increasing interest rates because the interest rates on the related notes were fixed at the time the contracts were sold 
with interest rates near historical lows as of the date of this report  it is reasonable to expect that interest rates will increase in the near to intermediate term 
any future increases in interest rates would likely increase the interest rates on notes issued in future term securitizations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity 
prepayments and credit losses 
gains from the sale of contracts in the company s past securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes have constituted a significant portion of the revenue of the company 
a portion of the gains is based in part on management s estimates of future prepayments and credit losses and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to contracts occur more quickly than was projected at the time such contracts were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  or if credit losses are greater than projected at the time such contracts were sold  a charge to income may be required and would be taken in the period of adjustment as has been the case  for example  in the year ended december  
if actual prepayments occur more slowly or if net losses are lower than estimated with respect to contracts sold  total revenue would exceed previously estimated amounts 
provisions for credit losses are recorded in connection with the origination and throughout the life of contracts that are held on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
such provisions are based on management s estimates of future credit losses in light of then current conditions 
if actual credit losses in a given period exceed the allowance for credit losses  a bad debt expense during the period would be required 
competition 
the automobile financing business is highly competitive 
the company competes with a number of national  local and regional finance companies 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies  such as commercial banks  savings and loan associations  leasing companies  credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers such as general motors acceptance corporation and ford motor credit corporation 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  technical  personnel and other resources than the company 
moreover  the company s future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of its capital relative to that of its competitors 
the company s competitors and potential competitors include far larger  more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments  and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to the company 
many of these companies also have longstanding relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers  including floor plan financing for the dealers purchases of automobiles from manufacturers  which is not offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully 
litigation 
because of the consumer oriented nature of the industry in which the company operates and the application of certain laws and regulations  industry participants are regularly named as defendants in class action litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts  including fraud 
many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws 
although the company is not involved in any such material consumer protection litigation  a significant judgment against the company or within the industry in connection with any such litigation  or an adverse outcome in the litigation identified under the caption legal proceedings in this report  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
dependence on dealers 
the company is dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with unaffiliated dealers to supply it with contracts 
during the year ended december   no dealer accounted for more than of the contracts purchased by the company 
the dealer agreements do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of contracts for purchase by the company 
the failure of dealers to submit contracts that meet the company s underwriting criteria would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
government regulations 
the company s business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations  which  among other things i require the company to obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications  ii limit the interest rates  fees and other charges the company is allowed to charge  iii limit or prescribe certain other terms of its contracts  iv require the company to provide specified disclosures  and v regulate certain servicing and collection practices and define its rights to repossess and sell collateral 
an adverse change in existing laws or regulations  or in the interpretation thereof  the promulgation of any additional laws or regulations  or the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r or the statement 
fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
modifications of share based payments will be treated as replacement awards with the cost of the incremental value recorded in the financial statements 
the statement is effective at the beginning of the third quarter of as of the effective date  the company will apply the statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas the impact of this statement on the company in and beyond will depend upon various factors  among them being our future compensation strategy 
the pro forma compensation costs presented in the table above and in prior filings for the company have been calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts that should be expected in future periods 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa issued statement of position no 
sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses the accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected from purchased loans or debt securities if those differences are attributable  in part  to credit quality 
sop requires purchased loans and debt securities to be recorded initially at fair value based on the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected with no carryover of any valuation allowance previously recognized by the seller 
interest income should be recognized based on the effective yield from the cash flows expected to be collected 
to the extent that the purchased loans or debt securities experience subsequent deterioration in credit quality  a valuation allowance would be established for any additional cash flows that are not expected to be received 
however  if more cash flows subsequently are expected to be received than originally estimated  the effective yield would be adjusted on a prospective basis 
sop will be effective for loans and debt securities acquired after december  the company s finance receivables are acquired shortly after origination and there is no credit deterioration during the time between origination of the finance receivable and purchase by the company 
accordingly  management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to july  the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
in this structure the notes issued by the company s special purpose subsidiary do not appear as debt on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies for a detailed discussion of the company s securitization structure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization 
specifically  the interest rates on the warehouse facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed 
historically  the company s term securitization facilities have had fixed rates of interest 
to mitigate some of this risk  the company has in the past  and intends to continue to  structure certain of its securitization transactions to include pre funding structures  whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
in pre funding  the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding  the amount as to which there can be no assurance 
the following table provides information on the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments by expected maturity date as of december thereafter fair value in thousands assets finance receivables        liabilities warehouse lines of credit   residual interest financing    securitization trust debt        weighted average effective interest rate senior secured debt    subordinated debt    includes approximately million in unfunded contracts that are included in restricted cash at december  as a result of a prefunding structure 
much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective 
when applicable  readily available market information has been utilized 
however  for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  active markets do not exist 
therefore  considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items 
the subjective factors include  among other things  the estimated timing and amount of cash flows  risk characteristics  credit quality and interest rates  all of which are subject to change 
since the fair value is estimated as of the dates shown in the table  the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different
