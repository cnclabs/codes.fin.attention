liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  representing an million increase from december  the increase is 
table of contents primarily due to cash provided by operating activities  cash received from the exercise of stock options  and the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by capital additions 
at december   we have net future payments under non cancelable operating leases of million and have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we expect to generate cash during as we expect revenue to continue to grow at a faster rate than operating expenses 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  and more recently  from cash generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the twelve months ended december   was comprised of net income from continuing operations of million  offset by net non cash related expenses of million  a million increase in current assets  and a million increase in liabilities 
net cash provided by operations was driven by the increase in revenue outpacing our increase in operating expenses 
terms for cash collections received from customers and cash payments made to vendors were consistent with normal business practices 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for the twelve months ended december   was comprised primarily of net proceeds from sales maturities of investments of million  offset by million of cash used for net capital additions  which were made up of computer equipment  technology upgrades  and leasehold improvements  and  used for intangible and other asset additions 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
we anticipate using available cash to fund growth in operations  invest in capital equipment  acquire businesses and to license technology or products related to our line of business 
we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years operating leases  net of subleases we believe that we have sufficient financial resources available to fund our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  short term investments 
disclosures about off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical factors and other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions  estimates  or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived from sales of our software licenses  hardware  royalties and maintenance arrangements to provide product upgrades and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop revenue from products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
maintenance revenue for providing product upgrades and customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to the various elements based on the fair value of each element sold 
we determine the fair value of each element based on its selling price when sold separately 
evidence of fair value includes the approved price list and discount schedule and the actual prices charged for comparable arrangements 
these price lists and discount schedules may change from time to time in response to factors including market conditions  value of services and product provided and competitive positioning 
historically  we have not offered significant discounts off of our list prices 
further  it is our policy that our distributors and resellers are not allowed to hold inventory with the exception of international resellers who are allowed to hold inventories of safeword for citrix and other safeword for products 
this is a low price point product with disproportionately high overseas freight costs 
as such  we allow the reseller to carry a balance of inventory and provide end user sell through reporting 
revenue is recognized at the point that we receive evidence of end user sell through 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the need for specific customer reserves  the aging of our receivables  customer creditworthiness  changes in our customer payment cycles  and current economic trends 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate based on actual results 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  capitalized software costs  a purchased customer list  a purchased control list  capitalized developed technology and goodwill  all of which are recorded at cost or fair value 
patents  trademarks  customer and control lists  and capitalized developed technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range up to years 
see accounting policy of capitalized software costs under research and development in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
if impairment is indicated  a write down is recorded as an impairment loss in income from operations 
we review our long lived assets and identified finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  except for goodwill as noted above 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based 
table of contents on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some component or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the computations of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are based on taxable income we expect to earn on sales of existing products and projected interest and other income over the next three years 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of the million of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
however  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or we are unable to implement our tax strategies 
inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas no 

sfas no 
requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of our first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   which is our third quarter of sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under fas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the two methods and have not yet determined which method will be used 
the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on october   the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the bill 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the bill 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and our accounts receivable more difficult to collect 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits and commercial paper 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held as available for sale 
we believe our operations are currently not subject to significant market risks for foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  or other relevant market price risks of a material nature
