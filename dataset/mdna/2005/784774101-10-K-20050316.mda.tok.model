overview simpletech  inc was originally incorporated in california in march as simple technology  inc our name was then changed to simpletech  inc 
in may simpletech designs  manufactures and markets custom and open standard memory solutions based on flash and dram memory technologies 
headquartered in santa ana  california  simpletech offers a comprehensive line of over  products and specializes in developing high density memory modules  memory cards and storage drives 
in june  we discontinued the operation of our xiran division  which was formed in as a result of our acquisition of the assets of irvine networks  llc 
we expect that several of the initiatives we implemented in  such as discontinuing the operations of our xiran division and reducing our general and administrative costs  including legal and litigation costs  will result in a decrease in operating expenses of nearly million per year 
our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the xiran division as a discontinued operation for all prior periods presented 
after we experienced revenue growth of from to and from to  revenues declined in and then increased in  in and in annual revenues in and were negatively impacted by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  severe declines in the price of dram components  and significantly reduced sales to customers in the communications and networking markets 
these negative conditions began to improve in the second quarter of and have continued to improve through the end of as demand for dram products increased and component prices stabilized 
however  there can be no assurance that flash and dram demand or component prices will increase or remain stable or that such trends will continue in the future 
we have targeted five areas for potential revenue growth in flash based products for military applications  reduced sized flash cards for mobile handsets  expansion of our international business  stacking products for new server and telecom customers and external nas storage devices in retail stores and for oems 
over the past several years  we have experienced an increase in demand for our flash products as a result of the growth in consumer electronics and oem applications  such as the replacement of rotating disk drives with flash products 
our flash revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  despite this growth  our revenues from flash products in dropped to million due to the negative impact of flash supply constraints and competitive component pricing issues 
we believe the expected addition of new flash suppliers in the industry and increased industry flash capacity in  as well as the launch in late of our new flash products targeted at military and mobile handset applications  will have a positive impact on our flash revenues and gross margins as well as our competitiveness in the market 
we had no revenue from these new flash products in 
table of contents in addition  we have experienced significant growth over the past year in demand for our ic tower stacking dram products from customers in the networking and server market sectors 
our high capacity ic tower stacking dram modules are used by our customers in their high end switching equipment and enterprise servers where maximizing memory content in the device is a priority 
our ic tower stacking dram revenues have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we sell our products through our consumer division and oem division 
our consumer division sells our products through the following channels var  mail order  distributor and mass market retailer 
our oem division was created in late to enhance the marketing of our products to oems 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our oem division is typically higher than our consumer division 
we track revenues and gross margins for our consumer and oem divisions 
we do not track separately  and do not intend to track separately  operating expenses for our consumer and oem divisions 
historically  a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for an aggregate of of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in micron semiconductor  cdw computer centers and smart modular accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues in cdw computer centers accounted for of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in other than micron semiconductor  cdw computer centers and smart modular  no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in  and the composition of our major customer base changes from quarter to quarter as the market demand for our products changes  and we expect this variability will continue in the future 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business risk factors sales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of any key customer would materially reduce our revenues 
for further details on our major customers  see business customers 
international sales of our products constituted of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in except for europe  which accounted for of our revenues in  no other foreign geographical area or single foreign country accounted for more than of our revenues in  and over of our international sales were denominated in us dollars in  and in addition  our purchases of ic components are currently denominated in us dollars 
however  we do face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
see business risk factors we face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including foreign currency fluctuations and trade barriers  that could lead to a decrease in demand for our products or an increase in the cost of the components used in our products 
in the past  we have been impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns resulting in lower sales in the first and second quarters of each year 
other factors  including component price fluctuations  may distort the effect of seasonality 
our ability to adjust our short term operating expenses in response to fluctuations in revenues is limited 
as a result  should revenues decrease to a level lower than expected in any given period  our results of operations would be harmed 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of operations data reflected as a percentage of revenues 
in june  we discontinued the operation of our xiran division

the increase in ic tower stacking units shipped resulted primarily from an increase in sales of ic tower stacking products to oem customers in the server and telecom markets 
the decrease in flash product units shipped resulted primarily from flash supply constraints and negative competitive component pricing issues that we encountered in most of the increase in our average sales price resulted primarily from a mix shift toward higher average sales price ic tower stacking products and more stable dram component prices in compared to the mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future  affecting our overall average sales price and gross margin 
our oem division revenues increased from million in to million in the increase in oem division revenue was due to a increase in average sale price from in to in  and a increase in oem division unit volume

in  net cash used in investing activities was attributable primarily to million of investments in marketable securities 
although we had no material capital expense commitments as of december   we expect to spend up to approximately million to million during the next months  primarily for manufacturing  testing and engineering equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and resulted primarily from the million repurchase of our common stock under our stock buy back plan  partially offset by the issuance of common stock for proceeds of million related to our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and was attributable primarily to million in proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in our follow on public offering in the fourth quarter of and million in proceeds related to the issuance of stock related to our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock from time to time over the next months 
we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average share price of  including commissions  in shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices through open market or unsolicited negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other considerations 
there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased by us  and we may discontinue purchases at any time when management 
table of contents determines that additional purchases are not warranted 
repurchased shares would be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock 
we believe that all funds required for the repurchase of common stock will be obtained from our available cash resources and marketable securities 
we believe that our existing assets  cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including our relationships with suppliers and customers  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  price discounts on our products to our customers  our pursuit of strategic transactions  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  our entrance into new markets  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  and competitors responses to our products 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  we do not have off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  payment due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations 
table of contents inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the past three fiscal years ended december   and new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and waste material spoilage 
such abnormal expenses must be recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
in addition  sfas no 
requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 that amends opinion to eliminate the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions of this statement are effective for all nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we are currently assessing the impact that adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements  however  we believe that adoption of this standard will result in a charge to reported earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for inventory excess  obsolescence and lower of market values over costs 
we purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term 
changes in operating strategy  customer demand and unpredictable fluctuations in market values of raw materials can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit 
we regularly monitor potential excess  or obsolete  inventory by analyzing the length of time in stock and compare market values to cost 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts and price protection 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly and all past due balances over days are reviewed for collectibility 
additionally  we maintain allowances for limited price protection rights for inventories of our products held by our customers as a result of recent sales transactions to them 
if we reduce the list price of our products  these customers may receive a credit from us 
by monitoring our inventory levels with our customers  we estimate the impact of such pricing changes on a regular basis and adjust our allowances accordingly 
product returns 
we offer a majority of our customers that purchase products through our consumer channels limited rights to return unsold inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relationships with our customers 
we provide for estimated future returns of inventory at the time of sale based on historical experience  and actual results have been within our expectations 
sales and marketing incentives 
sales and marketing incentives are offset against revenues or charged to operations in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 eitf sales and marketing incentives amounted to million for and million for  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were offset against revenues  and million and million  respectively  were charged as an operating expense 
consideration generally given by us to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of selling price  and therefore  a reduction of revenue 
however  if we receive an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration given to our customer that is sufficiently separable from our sales to that customer  such that we could have paid an independent company to receive that benefit  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit  then the consideration is characterized as an expense 
we estimate the fair value of the benefits we receive by tracking the advertising done by our customers on our behalf and calculating the value of that advertising using a comparable rate for similar publications 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if our ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
litigation and other contingencies 
management regularly evaluates our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  our management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in our operating strategy can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
at december   our investment in marketable securities was million 
the marketable securities consist of certificates of deposit with an original maturity of one year at different financial institutions 
at december   these marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent investments with an original maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
if interest rates were to decrease  the result would be an annual decrease in our interest income related to our cash and cash equivalents of approximately  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  were as follows expected maturity date thereafter total fair value investments cash and cash equivalents money market funds weighted average interest rate total cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable securities weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk more than of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive 
in addition  we purchase substantially all of our ic components from local distributors of japanese  korean and taiwanese suppliers 
fluctuations in the currencies of japan  korea or taiwan could have an adverse impact on the cost of our raw materials 
to date  we have not entered any derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rates
