restatement during the fiscal year end closing process  the company determined that its previously issued consolidated balance sheet for the year ended august  and consolidated statements of shareholders equity for the three years in the period ended august  needed to be restated to correct an inaccurate deferred tax calculation that affected our statement of operations for the fiscal year ended august  the company identified that  historically  the deferred income tax liability for the basis difference on indefinite lived intangibles calculated upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  was incorrectly offset against deferred income tax assets 
the deferred tax liability relating to this basis difference was assumed to reverse against the deferred tax asset  which resulted in the company not providing a sufficient valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
since this deferred tax liability relates to indefinite lived assets  it was not correct to net the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  the company determined that it should have recognized a deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase to goodwill related to the acquisition of intangible assets in a prior period 
the additional goodwill should have been expensed in the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
because all goodwill was considered impaired at the date that we adopted sfas no 
 and the additional deferred income tax liability should have been utilized to reduce the deferred tax valuation allowance 
these inaccurate deferred tax calculations impacted the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal by increasing the income tax benefit  and by decreasing the loss from continuing operations  by million  and by increasing the charge resulting from the cumulative effect of accounting change related to the adoption of sfas no 
by million 
the net effect of these errors increases the reported million net loss attributable to common shareholders in fiscal by million  to million 
for periods subsequent to fiscal  these errors only affected our consolidated balance sheets through the impact of increased net deferred tax liabilities and decreased retained earnings 
there was no impact in any year due to this restatement on net cash provided by operating  investing  or financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the following discussion in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the effects of this restatement where applicable 

back to top results of operations overview our operating results in fiscal showed significant year over year improvement in nearly every area  including increased sales  improved gross margins  and lower operating costs 
for the fiscal year ended august   we reported net income before preferred dividends and loss on preferred stock recapitalization of million  compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
our operating income for the year ended august  improved by million as we recognized operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  were as follows l sales performance our total sales increased by million  which represented the first increase in year over year sales performance in several years 
the increase in total sales was due to improved training and consulting services sales  which increased million compared to fiscal increased training and consulting sales was attributable to improvements in both domestic and international delivery channels 
during fiscal we also completed significant enhancements to our successful and well known the habits of highly effective people training course and related products 
we believe that our refreshed course materials and related products  in combination with our new training offerings  will contribute to continuing improvements in our training and consulting sales performance 
product sales decreased by million  which was primarily due to the impact of closed retail stores and declining technology and specialty product sales compared to the prior year 
l gross margin improvement our gross margin improved compared to the prior year primarily due to increased training and consulting sales as a percent of total sales  favorable product and training program mix changes  reduced product costs  and lower overall costs in delivering our training and consulting service sales 
l decreased operating costs our operating costs decreased by million  primarily due to reduced depreciation and reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses 
consistent with prior years  we continue to seek for and implement strategies that will enable us to reduce our operating costs in order to improve our profitability 
l improved cash flows from operations our cash flows from operations improved to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we were able to improve our cash flows from operations primarily through improved operating results and continued reductions of on hand inventories 
as a result of these and other factors  we were able to increase our cash and cash equivalents balance to million at august  l completion of the preferred stock recapitalization during fiscal  we completed a preferred stock recapitalization that allows the company to redeem shares of preferred stock 
although we recorded a million non cash loss resulting from the revaluation of our preferred stock and valuation of the newly issued common stock warrants  we were able to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters to redeem million  or million shares  of preferred stock in fiscal this redemption will save million annually in preferred dividends 
subsequent to august   we redeemed an additional million of preferred stock  which will save additional dividend costs in future periods 
although we achieved improved financial results in fiscal and saw improvements in many other related trends  we have not yet attained our targeted business model and we are therefore continuing our efforts to increase sales  improve gross margins  and reduce operating costs in order to achieve consistently profitable operations 
further details regarding our operating results and liquidity are provided throughout the following management s discussion and analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income loss before income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations year ended august  product sales training and consulting services sales total sales product cost of sales training and consulting services cost of sales total cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative impairment of and gain on disposal of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary provision for losses on management stock loans recovery of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary depreciation amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other expense  net income loss before income taxes segment review we have two reporting segments the consumer and small business unit csbu and the organizational solutions business unit osbu 
the following is a brief description of these segments and their primary operating activities 
consumer and small business unit this business unit is primarily focused on sales to individual customers and small business organizations and includes the results of the company s retail stores  catalog and ecommerce operations  wholesale  and other related distribution channels  including government sales  and office superstores 
the csbu results of operations also include the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consist of products such as planners  binders  software  and handheld electronic planning devices  virtually any component of the company s leadership and productivity solutions can be purchased through csbu channels 
during fiscal  we began an initiative to increase both training and product sales to small businesses through our csbu channels with the addition of a small business sales force and other initiatives designed especially for small business clients 
organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of productivity  leadership  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales performance  and effective communication training solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of our domestic sales force as well as our international operations 
our international operations include the financial results of our directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
the following table sets forth segment sales data for the years indicated 
for further information regarding our reporting segments and geographic information  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in thousands 
year ended august  consumer and small business unit retail stores consumer direct wholesale other csbu organizational solutions business unit domestic international total net sales 
back to top fiscal compared to fiscal product sales our overall product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  software  handheld electronic planning devices  and publishing  which are primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million  or six percent  compared to fiscal the decline in product sales was primarily due to decreased sales in our retail and wholesale delivery channels  with the majority of the decline in product sales occurring in our first quarter of fiscal the following is a description of sales performance in our csbu delivery channels during the fiscal year ended august  l retail sales the decline in retail sales was due to the impact of fewer stores  which represented million of the total million decline  and reduced technology and specialty product sales which totaled million 
during fiscal  we closed retail store locations and we closed additional stores during fiscal at august   we were operating retail stores compared to stores at august  overall product sales trends were reflected in a four percent decline in year over year comparable store stores which were open during the comparable periods sales 
declining technology and specialty product sales were partially offset by increased core product eg planners  binders  and totes sales during fiscal l consumer direct sales through our consumer direct channels catalog and ecommerce were generally consistent with the prior year and the slight increase was primarily due to increased core product sales compared to the prior year 
l wholesale sales sales through our wholesale channel  which includes sales to office superstores and other retail chains  decreased primarily due to a shift from contract stationer revenue channels to royalty based retail channels 
as a result of this change our sales decreased  but our gross margin contribution through this channel remained consistent with the prior year 
l other csbu sales other csbu sales primarily consist of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the increase in other csbu sales was primarily attributable to increased sublease income 
we have subleased a substantial portion of our corporate headquarters in salt lake city  utah and have recognized million of sublease revenue during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  which has been classified as other csbu sales 
training and consulting services sales we offer a variety of training solutions  training related products  and consulting services focused on productivity  leadership  strategy execution  sales force performance  and effective communications training programs that are provided both domestically and internationally through the organizational solutions business unit osbu 
our overall training and consulting service sales increased by million  or percent  compared to the same period of the prior year 
the improvement in training sales was reflected in both domestic and international training program and consulting sales 
our domestic sales performance improved in nearly all sales regions and was primarily attributable to increased client facilitated sales of the enhanced the habits of highly effective people training course  increased sales performance group sales  and improved sales of our the disciplines of leadership and xq offerings 
international sales improved by million  or percent primarily due to increased sales in japan  mexico  brazil  the united kingdom  increased licensee royalty revenues  and the translation of foreign sales amounts as foreign currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during much of fiscal the favorable impact of currency translation on reported international revenues totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  these increases were partially offset by decreased sales performance at our canadian operations 
gross margin gross margin consists of sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross margin may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
we record the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross margin may not be comparable with the gross margin of other retailers that include similar costs in their cost of sales 
our overall gross margin improved to percent of sales  compared to percent in fiscal this overall gross margin improvement is consistent with quarterly gross margin trends during fiscal and was primarily due to increased training and consulting sales as a percent of total sales  favorable product mix changes  lower product costs  and improved margins on our training and consulting service sales 
training and consulting service sales  which typically have higher gross margins than our product sales  increased to percent of total sales during fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
our gross margin on product sales improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to a favorable shift in our product mix as sales of higher margin paper products and binders increased as a percent of total sales  while sales of lower margin technology and specialty products continued to decline 
additionally  the overall margin on paper and binder sales has improved through focused cost reduction efforts  and improved inventory management 
training and related consulting services gross margin  as a percent of sales for these services  improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in our training and consulting services gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in training sales mix toward higher margin courses and offerings  reduced costs for training materials  such as participant manuals and related items  and overall lower costs associated with training sales 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million and improved as a percent of sales to percent  compared to percent in fiscal declining sg a expenses were the direct result of initiatives specifically designed to reduce our overall operating costs and is consistent with operating expense trends during the previous two fiscal years 
our cost reduction efforts have included retail store closures  headcount reductions  consolidation of corporate office space  and other measures designed to focus our resources on critical activities and projects 
these efforts were partially offset by increased commission expenses related to increased training sales  severance costs associated with a former executive officer  expenses related to the cancellation of the ceo s compensation agreement  additional costs associated with the preferred stock recapitalization  investments in new products  and costs of hiring new sales force personnel 
the primary effects of our cost cutting initiatives were reflected in reduced rent and utilities expenses of million and reductions in other sg a expenses  such as outsourcing and development costs  that totaled million compared to the prior year 
we also reduced our store closure costs by million refer to discussion below as many of the leases on stores that were closed expired during fiscal and did not require additional costs to exit the leases 
these improvements were partially offset by million of increased associate costs and million of additional advertising and promotion spending 
we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  including previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
during this assessment process  judgments are made as to whether under performing or unprofitable stores should be closed 
as a result of this evaluation process  we closed stores during fiscal the costs associated with closing retail stores are typically comprised of charges related to vacating the premises  which may include a provision for the remaining term on the lease  and severance and other personnel costs 
these store closure costs totaled million during fiscal and were included as a component of our sg a expense 
based upon our continuing analyses of retail store performance  we may close additional retail stores and may continue to incur costs associated with closing these stores in future periods 
during fiscal  our board of directors approved a plan to restructure our operations  which included an initiative to formally exit leased office space located in provo  utah 
during fiscal  we exercised an option  available under our master lease agreement  to purchase  and simultaneously sell  the office facility to the current tenant 
the negotiated purchase price with the landlord was million and the tenant agreed to purchase the property for million 
these prices were within the range of estimated fair values of the buildings as determined by an independent appraisal obtained by the company 
we paid the difference between the sale and purchase prices  plus other closing costs  which were included as a component of the restructuring plan accrual 
after completion of the sale transaction  the remaining fiscal restructuring costs  which totaled million  were credited to sg a expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
gain on disposal of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary during fiscal  we purchased approximately percent of the capital stock subsequently diluted to approximately percent ownership of agilix labs  inc agilix  for cash payments totaling million 
agilix is a development stage enterprise that develops software applications  including the majority of our software applications that are available for sale to external customers 
although we continue to sell software developed by agilix  uncertainties in agilix s business plan developed during our fiscal quarter ended march  and their potential adverse effects on agilix s operations and future cash flows were significant 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that our ability to recover the investment in agilix was remote 
accordingly  we impaired and expensed our remaining investment in agilix of million during the quarter ended march  during the quarter ended may   certain affiliates of agilix purchased the shares of capital stock held by us for million in cash  which was reported as a gain on disposal of an investment in unconsolidated subsidiary 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain property and equipment balances  primarily computer software and hardware  and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures during preceding fiscal years 
based upon these events and current capital spending trends  we expect that depreciation expense will continue to decline compared to prior periods 
amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million for the fiscal years ended august  and we expect intangible asset amortization expense to total million in fiscal as certain intangible assets become fully amortized in fiscal interest income and interest expense interest income our interest income increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to increased cash balances and higher interest rates on our interest bearing cash accounts 
interest expense our interest expense increased million primarily due to the sale of our corporate headquarters facility and the resulting interest component of our lease payments to the landlord 
we are accounting for the lease on the corporate facility as a financing obligation  which is accounted for similar to long term debt 
income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal resulted primarily from reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
this tax benefit was partially offset by taxes payable by foreign affiliates and taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees 
the income tax provision for fiscal was primarily attributable to taxes payable by foreign affiliates and taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees 
these foreign taxes were partially offset by the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
as of august  and  given our recent history of significant operating losses  we had provided a valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred income tax assets 
as of august  and  we had net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
our foreign deferred tax assets of million and million at august  and primarily relate to our operations in japan 
the net domestic deferred tax liability of million at august  and the restated million deferred liability at august  primarily relate to the step up of indefinite lived intangibles 
for further information concerning deferred tax items  including the restatement of prior period deferred tax liabilities  refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
loss on recapitalization of preferred stock we completed our preferred stock recapitalization during the quarter ended may  due to the significant modifications to our preferred stock  we determined that previously outstanding preferred stock was replaced with new classes of preferred stock and common stock warrants 
as a result  the new preferred stock was recorded at its fair value on the date of modification  which was determined to be equal to the liquidation preference of per share 
the difference between the aggregate fair value of the consideration given the new series a preferred stock and the common stock warrants and the carrying value of the previously existing series a preferred stock  which totaled million  was reported as a loss on recapitalization of preferred stock  which decreased net income attributable to common shareholders in the quarter ended may  subsequent to may   we used million of the proceeds from the june sale of our corporate headquarters facility to redeem shares of preferred stock under terms of the recapitalization plan 
subsequent to august   we redeemed an additional million of preferred stock and announced that we intend to seek shareholder approval to amend our articles of incorporation to extend the period during which we have the right to redeem the outstanding preferred stock at percent of the liquidation preference 
the amendment would extend the current redemption deadline from march  to december  and would also provide the right to extend the redemption period for an additional year to december   if another million of preferred stock is redeemed before december  
back to top fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales our product sales  which are primarily delivered through our csbu channels  declined million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the decline in product sales compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the following sales performance at our various csbu channels 
retail sales decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal the decline in retail sales was primarily attributable to the following l million of the retail sales decrease is the result of the closure of retail stores 
the company closed stores in fiscal in addition to domestic and international stores that were closed in fiscal these store closures were primarily comprised of unprofitable stores and stores located in markets where we had multiple retail operations 
l million of the retail store decrease was the result of declining comparable store technology sales  which include handheld electronic devices  or pdas  and related products 
comparable stores are retail locations which have been open for the full year in the periods reported 
technology sales decreased as competition increased from office product superstores and discounters 
sales of core products remained relatively flat  decreasing less than one percent compared to fiscal at august   we were operating retail stores compared to stores at august  consumer direct includes catalog and ecommerce operations sales decreased million  or two percent  compared with fiscal the primary factors affecting consumer direct sales were as follows l technology sales  including handheld electronic devices and pdas  through this channel decreased million 
l the total number of orders placed through the consumer direct channel decreased five percent from the prior year 
during  our wholesale sales increased million  or percent  as we expanded our product offerings in office superstores and discount stores 
offsetting this increase were decreased other csbu sales  which are comprised primarily of government product and external printing sales  and declined by million compared to the prior year 
during fiscal  we outsourced the sale and distribution of our products through government channels to a well established office products distributor 
accordingly  we now only recognize royalty income from the distributor rather than the net sale and corresponding costs related to those sales 
training and consulting services sales our overall training and consulting service sales declined million  or six percent  compared to the prior year 
decreased training sales were primarily due to decreased domestic training sales which experienced a slow start in fiscal of the million decline in domestic training sales  million occurred during the first two quarters of fiscal and was primarily attributable to decreased client facilitated leadership programs 
decreased leadership training was partially offset by increased productivity training and sales from our new program  the disciplines of execution and related xq sales 
however  our training and consulting business improved significantly during late fiscal  especially in the fourth quarter 
international sales  which represented percent of our osbu segment sales in fiscal  increased by million  or percent compared to the prior year 
international sales growth was led by our two largest international offices  located in japan and the united kingdom  which experienced growth rates of percent and percent during fiscal currency conversion also favorably impacted international results through translation of foreign sales to us dollars 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations  international sales grew percent compared to fiscal gross margin for fiscal  our overall gross margin improved to percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in our overall gross margin was primarily due to increased margins from product sales and an increase in training and service sales as a percent of total sales 
increased gross margin on product sales was primarily due to a favorable shift in our product mix away from technology and specialty products to higher margin paper and binder products 
paper product sales  including forms and tabs  combined with binder product sales  increased as a percentage of total sales to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal our gross margins on paper and binder products also increased as a result of specific cost reduction initiatives 
training solution and related services gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased to percent compared to percent the prior year 
the decline in our training gross margin during the year was primarily due to the delivery of certain higher cost programs that are part of a longer term marketing strategy 
these activities include custom programs for certain strategic clients  multiple domestic symposium events  and a series of international events that also had lower gross margins than our other training programs 
these factors were partially offset by ongoing initiatives designed to reduce overall training program delivery costs that continue to have a favorable impact on our training and services gross margin 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
declining sg a expenses were the direct result of initiatives specifically designed to reduce our overall operating costs and were consistent with sg a expense trends during the previous two fiscal years 
our cost reduction efforts have included retail store closures  headcount reductions  consolidation of corporate office space  and other measures designed to focus our resources on critical activities and projects 
the primary effects of these cost cutting initiatives were reflected in associate expense reductions totaling million  advertising and promotional expense reductions totaling million  reduced rent and utilities charges totaling million  and reductions in other sg a expenses  such as outsourcing and development costs  that totaled million compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these cost reduction efforts were million of additional expenses related to retail store closures  as discussed below 
we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  which includes assessment of previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
as a result of this evaluation process  we decided to close certain stores during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we closed retail stores and incurred additional expenses related to certain store closures that occurred during fiscal these store closure costs totaled million during fiscal and were reported as a component of our sg a expense 
provision for losses on management common stock program prior to may  we utilized a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that were appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
based upon this systematic methodology  we recorded a million increase to the loan loss reserve during fiscal as a result of modifications to the terms of the management stock loans that were approved in may and their effects on the company and loan participants refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further information  we determined that the management common stock loans should be accounted for as non recourse stock compensation instruments 
while this accounting treatment does not alter the legal rights associated with the loans to the participants  the modifications to the terms of the loans were deemed significant enough to adopt the non recourse accounting model 
as a result of this accounting treatment  the remaining carrying value of the notes and interest receivable related to financing common stock purchases by related parties  which totaled million prior to the accounting change  was reduced to zero with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
we currently account for the non recourse stock loans as variable stock option instruments 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  which we will adopt on september   additional compensation expense will only be recognized on the loans if the company takes action on the loans that in effect constitutes a modification of an option 
although we do not anticipate significant further compensation expense related to the management stock loans  this accounting treatment precludes us from recovering the amounts expensed as additions to the loan loss reserve  totaling million  which were recognized in prior periods 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these management stock loan receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain computer hardware and software assets  the prior year impairment of retail store assets  which totaled million  and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures during preceding fiscal years 
amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the reduction in our amortization expense was due to the full amortization of certain definite lived intangible assets 
income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal was primarily attributable to taxes payable by foreign affiliates and taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees 
these foreign taxes were partially offset by the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters and a foreign income tax benefit related to our japan operations 

back to top quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for fiscal and fiscal the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
quarterly financial information year ended august  november february may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expense depreciation amortization income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income loss preferred stock dividends loss on recapitalization of preferred stock income loss attributable to common shareholders basic and diluted income loss per share attributable to common shareholders year ended august  november february may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expense depreciation amortization income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income loss preferred stock dividends loss attributable to common shareholders basic and diluted loss per share attributable to common shareholders our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklincovey planners on a calendar year basis 
domestic training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reclassified certain overhead costs that were included in cost of sales to selling  general  and administrative expense 
the quarterly information included above was adjusted to reflect the quarterly impact of this reclassification 
amounts reclassified from cost of sales to selling  general  administrative expense consisted of the following in thousands quarter ended fiscal fiscal november february may august total reclassified during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to properly record shares of company stock held by our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
this correction resulted in a million favorable adjustment to our sg a expense during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended august  quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products or training seminars  the addition of new institutional customers  the timing of large corporate orders  the elimination of unprofitable products or training services  and the closure of retail stores 

back to top liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by operating activities  line of credit financing  long term borrowings  asset sales  and the issuance of preferred and common stock 
we currently rely primarily upon cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital levels 
at august  we had million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments compared to million at august  our net working capital current assets less current liabilities increased to million at august  compared to million at august  during fiscal  we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters located in salt lake city  utah and received net proceeds totaling million 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the campus to redeem million of preferred stock  and we anticipate that additional redemptions in future periods will occur if our cash flows from operating activities continue to improve 
however  in connection with the sale of our corporate campus we incurred a long term financing obligation for the purchase price 
the annual payments on the financing obligation are approximately million per year for the first five years with two percent annual increases thereafter 
the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended august  cash flows from operating activities during fiscal our net cash provided by operating activities improved to million compared to million in fiscal our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our cash flows from operating activities were favorably affected by increased sales compared to fiscal and we recognized cash flow improvements from operating activities through reduced cash payments for costs and expenses related to generating these revenues  which was reflected by improved gross margins and income from operations 
we also received million in cash from a legal settlement rendered in our favor 
during fiscal  our primary uses of cash for operating activities were related to increased accounts receivable that was primarily due to increased sales in our osbu during the fourth quarter of fiscal and payment of income taxes on international royalty revenue and on the sale of our corporate headquarters 
partially offsetting these uses of cash were improved cash flows from reduced inventory balances 
in addition to the impact of closed stores  we have actively sought to improve our inventory levels through better management of on hand inventories  especially for electronic devices 
we believe that efforts to optimize working capital balances combined with existing and planned efforts to increase sales  including sales of new products and services  and cost cutting initiatives  will improve our cash flows from operating activities in future periods 
however  the success of these efforts is dependent upon numerous factors  many of which are not within our control 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  our primary sources of investing cash were the sale of million of short term investments and million of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary 
these cash inflows were partially offset by purchases of short term marketable securities totaling million and the purchase of million of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of tenant improvements on subleased areas of our corporate campus  computer hardware  software  and leasehold improvements in certain of our retail stores 
during fiscal  we also invested million in curriculum development  primarily related to our refreshed the habits of highly effective people training course 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal totaled million 
as mentioned above  we completed the sale of our corporate campus in salt lake city  utah during the fourth quarter of fiscal and received net proceeds totaling million 
the proceeds from the sale of our corporate campus was a financing activity 
as a result of this transaction we will use cash in future periods to repay the financing obligation through our monthly lease payment refer to the discussion under contractual obligations below 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the corporate campus to redeem million of preferred stock at its liquidation preference under the terms of our recapitalization agreement 
this redemption will reduce our ongoing cash outflows for preferred dividends by million per year 
during fiscal  we paid million for preferred dividends  which included accrued dividends on the million shares of preferred stock that were redeemed 
we anticipate making additional preferred stock redemptions under the terms of our recapitalization plan if our cash flows from operating activities continue to improve 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of payments to eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing and distribution  and call center operations  payments on the financing obligation resulting from the sale of our corporate campus  minimum rent payments for retail store and sales office space  cash payments for series a preferred stock dividends  mortgage payments on certain buildings and property  and monitoring fees paid to a series a preferred stock investor 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services required payments on corporate campus financing obligation minimum operating lease payments preferred stock dividend payments debt payments contractual computer hardware and software purchases monitoring fees paid to a preferred stock investor total expected contractual obligation payments the company s variable rate debt payments include interest payments at  which was the applicable interest rate at september  amount reflects the million preferred stock redemption that occurred subsequent to august  and will decline if we determine to make future redemptions of our preferred stock 
we are contractually obligated by our eds outsourcing agreement to purchase the necessary computer hardware and software to keep such equipment up to current specifications 
amounts shown are estimated capital purchases of computer hardware and software under terms of the eds outsourcing agreement and its amendments 
other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities on the condition that we can continue to improve our cash flows generated from operating activities  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms 

back to top use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources l products we sell planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other related products that are primarily sold through our csbu channels 
l training and services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in strategic execution  leadership  productivity  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
these training programs and services are primarily sold through our osbu channels 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sale transaction in a retail store 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  sales arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the sales contract meet the following criteria the delivered training or product has value to the client on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
if the fair value of all undelivered elements exits  but fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  the residual method is used 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total contract consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for the company s existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products and support to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the majority of the company s software sales have elements  including a license and post contract customer support pcs 
currently the company does not have vsoe for either the license or support elements of its software sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred until the only undelivered element is pcs and the total arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances past due over days  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
our inventories are comprised primarily of dated calendar products and other non dated products such as binders  handheld electronic devices  stationery  training products  and other accessories 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we make judgments regarding future demand requirements and compare these assessments with current and committed inventory levels 
inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is assigned to the osbu and is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars  international licensee royalties  and related products 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
the evaluation of long lived assets requires us to use estimates of future cash flows 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our history of significant operating losses precludes us from demonstrating that it is more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred income tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards will be realized 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances on the majority of our deferred income tax assets 
these valuation allowances are based on estimates of future taxable income or losses that may or may not be realized

 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  this new statement follows the approach previously defined in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we previously accounted for our stock based compensation using the intrinsic method as defined in apb opinion no 
and accordingly  we have not recognized any expense for our stock option plans or employee stock purchase plan in our consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june   and will thus be effective for our first quarter of fiscal upon adoption  we intend to use the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with statement r 
based upon our analysis of the requirements of sfas no 
r  our employee stock purchase plan will become a compensatory plan in fiscal however  due to current participation levels in the employee stock purchase plan and remaining levels of unvested stock option compensation expense  we do not believe that the adoption sfas no 
r will have a material impact upon our results of operations until we grant additional stock option awards or until participation in our employee stock purchase plan significantly increases 
however  the transition to sfas no 
r will require us to reclassify our unamortized deferred compensation reported in the equity section of our balance sheet to additional paid in capital 
for further information regarding our share based compensation  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
inventory costs in november  the fasb approved statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter statement no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as a current period expense regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal 
this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  and will thus be effective for our first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that the new accounting requirements of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements

amends apb opinion no 
 which is based upon the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  by eliminating the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replacing it with a general exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
statement no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the requirements of this statement will have a material impact upon our financial statements 
regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on retail sales made through its stores and catalog sales 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations

back to top item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments the company is exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts do not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expire on a quarterly basis  are recognized currently and are used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated statements of operations and resulted in the following net losses for the periods indicated in thousands year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net losses on foreign exchange contracts at august   the fair value of these contracts  which was determined using the estimated amount at which contracts could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  was insignificant 
the notional amounts of our foreign currency sell contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting were as follows at august  in thousands contract description notional amount in foreign currency notional amount in us dollars japanese yen australian dollars mexican pesos net investment hedges during fiscal and  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that were designed to manage foreign currency risks related to the value of our net investment in directly owned operations located in canada  japan  and the united kingdom 
these three offices comprise the majority of our net investment in foreign operations 
these foreign currency forward instruments qualified for hedge accounting and corresponding gains and losses were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal and  we recognized the following net losses on our net investment hedging contracts in thousands year ended august  losses on net investment hedge contracts gains on net investment hedge contracts net losses on investment hedge contracts as of august   we had settled our net investment hedge contracts and we had none outstanding 
however  we may continue to utilize net investment hedge contracts in future periods as a component of our overall foreign currency risk strategy 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in us interest rates primarily as a result of the cash and cash equivalents that we hold 
following the sale of our building in june  our debt balances consist of the financing obligation from the sale of the corporate campus  one fixed rate long term mortgage  and one variable rate mortgage on certain of our buildings and property 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a lease arrangement with an interest rate of percent 
our fixed rate debt has a percent interest rate and was paid in full during september and our variable rate mortgage has interest at the canadian prime rate percent at august  and requires payments through january during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments 

back to top business environment and risk our business environment  current domestic and international economic conditions  and other specific risks may affect our future business decisions and financial performance 
the matters discussed below may cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations  and stock price 
we have experienced significant declines in sales and corresponding net losses in recent fiscal years and we may not be able to return to consistent profitability although our sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  we have experienced significant sales declines in recent years 
our sales during fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal while our net income before preferred dividends and recapitalization loss has improved to million in fiscal  declining sales have also had a corresponding adverse impact upon our operating results during recent fiscal years and we have reported net losses totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal we continue to implement initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve our operating results  and have recognized significant improvements in recent years  however  we cannot assure that we will return to consistently profitable operations 
in addition to declining sales  we have faced numerous challenges that have affected our operating results in recent years 
specifically  we have experienced  and may continue to experience the following l declining traffic in our retail stores and consumer direct channel l increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories l operating expenses that  as a percentage of sales  have exceeded our desired business model l costs associated with exiting unprofitable retail stores our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions  levels of business activity  and other changes experienced by our clients uncertain economic conditions continue to affect many of our clients businesses and their budgets for training  consulting  and related products 
such economic conditions and budgeted spending are influenced by a wide range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting 
these conditions include l the overall demand for training  consulting  and our related products l conditions and trends in the training and consulting industry l general economic and business conditions l general political developments  such as the war on terrorism  and their impacts upon our business both domestically and internationally l natural disasters in addition  our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and  consequently  the benefits of any economic recovery may take longer for us to realize than other segments of the economy 
future deterioration of economic conditions  particularly in the united states  could increase these effects on our business 
we may not be able to compensate for lower sales or unexpected cash outlays with cost reductions significant enough to generate positive net income although we have initiated cost cutting efforts that have included headcount reductions  retail store closures  consolidation of administrative office space  and changes in our advertising and marketing strategy  if we are not able to prevent further revenue declines or achieve our growth objectives  we will need to further reduce our costs 
an unintended consequence of additional cost reductions may be reduced sales 
if we are not able to effectively reduce our costs and expenses commensurate with  or at the same pace as  any further deterioration in our sales  we may not be able to generate positive net income or cash flows from operations 
although we have experienced improved cash flows from operations during fiscal and  an inability to maintain or continue to increase cash flows from operations may have an adverse impact upon our liquidity and ability to operate the business 
for example  we may not be able to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital on terms that would be acceptable to us 
we are unable to predict the exact amount of cost reductions required for us to generate increased cash flows from operations because we cannot accurately predict the amount of our future sales 
our future sales performance depends  in part  on future economic and market conditions  which are not within our control 
our global operations pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax  and economic risks  which we may not adequately address we have company owned offices in australia  brazil  canada  japan  mexico  and the united kingdom 
we also have licensed operations in numerous other foreign countries 
as a result of these foreign operations and their growing impact upon our results of operations  we are subject to a number of risks  including l restrictions on the movement of cash l burdens of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws l the absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights l political instability l currency exchange rate fluctuations l longer payment cycles l price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies while we are not currently aware of any of the foregoing conditions materially adversely affecting our operations  these conditions  which are outside of our control  could change at any time 
we operate in a highly competitive industry the training and consulting industry is highly competitive with a relatively easy entry 
competitors continually introduce new programs and products that may compete directly with our offerings 
larger and better capitalized competitors may have enhanced abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop and implement training courses or methodologies that may adversely affect our ability to sell our methodologies to new clients 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs our profit margin on training services is largely a function of the rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization  or chargeability  of our trainers  client partners  and consultants 
accordingly  if we are unable to maintain sufficient pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our training professionals without corresponding cost reductions  our profit margin and overall profitability will suffer 
the rates that we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors  including l our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our programs and products l competition l general economic conditions l introduction of new programs or services by us or our competitors l our ability to accurately estimate  attain  and sustain engagement sales  margins  and cash flows over longer contract periods our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including l seasonal trends  primarily as a result of scheduled training l our ability to forecast demand for our products and services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in our employee base l our ability to manage attrition our profitability is also a function of our ability to control costs and improve our efficiency in the delivery of our products and services 
our cost cutting initiatives  which focus on reducing both fixed and variable costs  may not be sufficient to deal with downward pressure on pricing or utilization rates 
as we introduce new programs and seek to increase the number of our training professionals  we may not be able to manage a significantly larger and more diverse workforce  control our costs  or improve our efficiency 
our new training programs and products may not be widely accepted in the marketplace in an effort to improve our sales performance  we have made significant investments in new training and consulting offerings such as the disciplines of execution 
additionally  we have invested in our existing programs in order to refresh these programs and keep them relevant in the marketplace  including the newly revised the habits of highly effective people curriculum 
we expect that these new programs  combined with new product offerings  will contribute to future growth in our revenue 
although we believe that our intellectual property is highly regarded in the marketplace  the demand for these new programs and products is still emerging 
if our clients demand for these new programs and products does not develop as we expect  or if our sales and marketing strategies for these programs are not effective  our financial results could be adversely impacted and we may need to change our business strategy 
if we are unable to attract  retain  and motivate high quality employees  we will not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to grow our business due to our reliance on customer satisfaction  our overall success and ability to grow are dependent  in part  on our ability to hire  retain  and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the necessary skills needed to serve clients and grow our business 
the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious adverse effect on us  including our ability to obtain and successfully complete important client engagements and thus maintain or increase our sales 
we continue to offer a variable component of compensation  the payment of which is dependent upon our sales performance and profitability 
we adjust our compensation levels and have adopted different methods of compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of employees with the necessary skills to serve our clients and grow our business 
we may also use equity based performance incentives as a component of our executives compensation  which may affect amounts of cash compensation 
variations in any of these areas of compensation may adversely impact our operating performance 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as our international operations continue to grow and become a larger component of our financial results  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens 
in order to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk  we make limited use of foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge certain transactions and translation exposure 
there can be no guarantee that our foreign currency risk management strategy will be effective in reducing the risks associated with foreign currency transactions and translation 
our product sales may continue to decline and result in changes to our profitability in recent years  our product sales have declined 
these product sales  which are primarily delivered through our retail stores  consumer direct channels catalog call center and ecommerce  wholesale  and government product channels have historically been very profitable for us 
however  due to recent declines  we have reevaluated our product business and have taken steps to restore its profitability 
these initiatives have included hiring an additional sales force based at certain retail stores  retail store closures  transitioning catalog customers to our ecommerce site  outsourcing our government products channel  and increasing our business through wholesale channels 
however  these initiatives may also result in decreased gross margins on our product sales if lower margin wholesale sales continue to increase 
if product sales continue to decline or gross margins decline  our product sales strategies may not be adequate to return our product delivery channels to past profitability levels 
our strategy of outsourcing certain functions and operations may fail to reduce our costs for these services we have an outsourcing contract with electronic data systems eds to provide warehousing  distribution  information systems  and call center operations 
under terms of the outsourcing contract and its addendums  eds operates the company s primary call center  provides warehousing and distribution services  and supports our various information systems 
certain components of the outsourcing agreement contain minimum activity levels that we must meet or we will be required to pay penalty charges 
if these activity levels are not achieved  we may not realize anticipated benefits from the eds outsourcing agreement in these areas 
our outsourcing contracts with eds contain early termination provisions that we may exercise under certain conditions 
however  in order to exercise the early termination provisions  we would have to pay specified penalties to eds depending upon the circumstances of the contract termination 
we have significant intangible asset balances that may be impaired if cash flows from related activities declines at august  we had million of intangible assets  which were primarily generated from the fiscal merger with the covey leadership center 
these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment based upon cash flows definite lived intangible assets and estimated royalties from revenue streams indefinite lived intangible assets 
although our current sales and cash flows are sufficient to support these intangibles  if our sales and corresponding cash flows decline  we may be faced with significant asset impairment charges 
our sales are subject to changes in consumer preferences and buying trends our product sales are subject to changing consumer preferences and difficulties in anticipating or forecasting these changes may result in adverse consequences to our sales 
although we continue to have a substantial loyal customer base for many of our existing products  changes in consumer preferences  such as a shift in demand from paper based planners to handheld electronic devices or other technology products may have an adverse impact upon our sales 
while we have experienced stabilizing sales in our core products paper based planners  binders  and accessories during fiscal  we are still subject to consumer preferences for these products 
our future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price historically  our stock price has experienced significant volatility 
we expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors that may include the following l fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows l variations between our actual financial results and market expectations l changes in our key balances  such as cash and cash equivalents l currency exchange rate fluctuations l unexpected asset impairment charges l no analyst coverage in addition  the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations over the past several quarters that has had some impact upon our stock and other stock issues in the market 
these factors  as well as general investor concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements and the accounting profession  may have a material adverse effect upon our stock in the future 
we may need additional capital in the future  and this capital may not be available to us on favorable terms we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt offerings or equity financings in order to l develop new services  programs  or products l take advantage of opportunities  including expansion of the business l respond to competitive pressures we may be unable to obtain the necessary capital on terms or conditions that are favorable to us 
we are the creditor for a management common stock loan program that may not be fully collectible we are the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a multinational company  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the united states and various foreign tax jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
in the normal course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  valued added  and property taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes and may have exposure to additional non income tax liabilities 
we may be exposed to potential risks relating to internal controls procedures and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors while we believe that we can comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our failure to document  implement  and comply with these requirements may harm our reputation and the market price of our stock could suffer 
we may be exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal controls and have those controls attested to by their independent auditors 
we are evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow our management to report on  and our independent auditors attest to  our internal controls  as a required part of our annual report on form k beginning with our report for the fiscal year ended august  at present  there is little precedent available with which to measure compliance adequacy 
in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner  our reputation  financial results  and market price of our stock could suffer 
we may elect to use our cash to redeem shares of preferred stock  which may decrease our ability to respond to adverse changes our outstanding preferred stock bears a cumulative dividend equal to percent per annum 
during fiscal  we utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters to redeem million of our preferred stock 
subsequent to august   we redeemed an additional million of preferred stock and we are proposing to amend the terms of our preferred stock recapitalization that was completed in fiscal to extend the period during which we can redeem preferred stock at an amount equal to the liquidation preference 
we have obtained an agreement from the majority holder of the preferred stock to vote in favor of such an amendment 
we anticipate that we may redeem additional shares of preferred stock in the future to the extent that we believe sufficient cash is available to do so 
any such redemptions will reduce our cash on hand and may reduce our ability to adequately respond to any future adverse changes in our business and operations  whether anticipated or unanticipated
