item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses the consolidated financial statements of packaging dynamics corporation the company  packaging dynamics  we or our which is a delaware corporation established as a holding company to own all interests in packaging dynamics operating company pdoc  a delaware corporation which is the parent company of all our current operating companies 
the following discussion including the summary and outlook should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see special note regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
in the discussion that follows  dollar amounts other than per share data are stated in thousands 
summary and outlook the business is generally experiencing solid performance in each operating segment 
over the next few quarters  the company s primary focus will be on integrating the acquisition of papercon into the food packaging segment 
other priorities include expanding sales of new and existing products  improving manufacturing productivity and reducing overall product costs 
the company is evaluating a number of specific capital investment opportunities to expand product capabilities and reduce production costs 
if approved  these investments could result in total capital expenditures of approximately  in compared to  in and an estimated normalized range of  to  including papercon 
the company is also continuing its efforts to identify and pursue acquisition candidates which have the potential to expand the company s product capabilities  market participation and geographical presence 
the company s results are typically weakest in the first quarter of the year due  in part  to seasonal factors impacting certain markets served by the company s food packaging operating segment 
in addition  the first quarter of will be impacted by weakness in sales by the company s specialty laminations operating segment 
this is primarily the result of a combination of global shortages of a key raw material used by the company s building products customers in the production of their products and a strategic decision by the company to focus its resources on a narrower set of building products customers in an effort to maximize long term sales growth 
financial performance our continuing operations are comprised of two operating segments food packaging and specialty laminations 
the food packaging segment converts paper  film and foil into a variety of specialty value added food packaging products 
the specialty laminations segment produces multi layer laminated structures from a variety of substrates foil  paper  paperboard and film  adhesives and coatings for use in various food  consumer  medical and industrial packaging applications as well as the production of insulation for the building materials market 
our discontinued operation is the specialty paper segment which we exited during in connection with our decision to shut down the detroit paper mill 
the company s management reporting system measures segment operating performance based on segment operating income 
certain items  such as asset sales and disposals and the long term incentive compensation charge are excluded from segment operating income 
corporate administrative expenses are allocated to the segments on a direct basis where appropriate with the remainder being allocated based on revenues 
see note to the company s annual consolidated financial statements for further information 
food packaging net sales    segment operating income    segment operating income margin depreciation and amortization    net sales increased  or  during compared to papercon  which was acquired on september   contributed  of net sales in excluding papercon  the net sales increase in the period was attributable to a combination of unit volume growth in key end markets as well as the impact of raw material related pricing actions 
net sales increased  or  during compared to the increase was primarily due to incremental sales volume related to the wolf acquisition  partially offset by the impact of lower pricing resulting from shifts from foil to paper products by several customers in our foodservice markets and the strategic exit of certain products and customers in our distribution and retail markets 
segment operating income increased  or  in compared to and segment operating income margin decreased to from during compared to the increase in operating income was primarily due to incremental operating income related to the papercon acquisition as the impact of increased sales and cost initiatives in our base business were generally offset by increased raw material and employee related costs 
in addition  results were negatively impacted by a lower margin on the inventory acquired in the papercon acquisition  which  as a result of acquisition purchase accounting  was higher than their manufactured cost 
segment operating income increased  or  in compared to and segment operating income margin increased to from during compared to the increase was primarily due to increased sales as a result of the wolf acquisition 
the improved margin reflected the ongoing impact of our productivity investments in converting equipment  lower manufacturing overhead due to reduced overall staffing levels  and improving product mix as we exited unprofitable products and customers 
specialty laminations net sales    segment operating income    segment operating income margin depreciation and amortization    net sales increased  or  during compared to approximately of the sales growth is due to the iuka plant which the company acquired in december the remaining increase was attributable to a combination of unit volume growth in key end markets and raw material related pricing actions 
net sales increased  or  during compared to the increase was primarily due to increased sales of products to building materials customers partially offset by reduced sales of food packaging products 
segment operating income increased  or  in compared to and segment operating income margin decreased to from during compared to the increase in operating income was due to the contribution of the iuka plant acquired in  the positive impact of volume increases  raw material related pricing actions and cost and productivity gains partially offset by raw material and other operating cost increases 
segment operating income increased  or  in compared to and segment operating income margin increased to from during compared to this increase was primarily due to increased sales volume  improved sales mix and manufacturing cost and productivity improvements 
asset sales and disposals and long term management incentive charge we continue our efforts to upgrade the capabilities of our manufacturing operations and dispose of assets which are not needed to execute our business strategy 
during  we sold a parcel of unused property near one of our plants and recorded a gain of during and  we idled certain converting equipment in our chicago  illinois and baxter springs  kansas manufacturing facilities due to the purchase of five new bag machines in the new bag machines have improved productivity on several product categories 
these manufacturing improvements and certain other productivity improvements resulted in a loss in and of and  respectively  on the sale or disposal of the equipment 
also  as discussed further in note to the company s annual consolidated financial statements  we recorded a non cash long term incentive compensation charge of  during interest expense interest expense was  in compared to  in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased average outstanding indebtedness of approximately  as a result of the third quarter acquisition of papercon  partially offset by overall lower average borrowing rates 
the average interest rate on borrowings in was approximately compared to in in the third quarter of  the company expensed of costs incurred in connection with amending the terms of its term debt to provide for the papercon acquisition 
in  the company expensed  of unamortized bank fees in continuing operations and in discontinued operations resulting from the company s credit facility refinancing 
interest expense during was  compared to  during the same period in the decrease in interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from decreased average outstanding indebtedness as a result of reductions in working capital and the forgiveness of the promissory note payable to ivex 
the average interest rates on borrowings in was approximately compared to in income taxes the income tax provision for continuing operations was   and  for  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was  and for  and  respectively 
during  due to the losses incurred related to the shutdown of the detroit paper mill in  we paid cash taxes only for us alternative minimum tax  state taxes and us income taxes on papercon earnings for approximately one month following the acquisition date until papercon became part of the company s consolidated filing group 
on july   a new holding company structure was created by contributing all of the limited liability company interests of packaging holdings to packaging dynamics  a c corporation for income tax purposes  in exchange for the common stock 
prior to the distribution  the members of packaging holdings reported federal and state taxable income on their income tax returns as if it were a partnership 
ici has remained a taxable c corporation from the time we acquired it in july through the date of the distribution 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase resulted primarily from the following factors discussed above incremental earnings from the papercon and iuka acquisitions  positive impacts from sales volume increases  raw material related pricing actions and manufacturing productivity initiatives in our base business  raw material and other cost increases  and a gain on asset disposals in versus a loss on asset disposals of in the increase was primarily due to the following factors discussed above non cash long term incentive compensation expense of  recorded in  a reduction in loss on asset disposals  the impact of sales changes  and manufacturing cost and productivity initiatives 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in was  compared to a loss of  in and a loss of  in the net loss for represents the following   after tax of administrative expense associated with the ongoing program to clear the site  recover assets and dispose of the detroit property  after tax of expense due to additional withdrawal liability from a multi employer pension plan  and after tax of proceeds from the liquidation of equipment 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a   after tax asset impairment charge and a   after tax severance charge 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an additional charge of   after tax primarily related to the write down of parts and supplies inventories  the write down of other current assets and for employee outplacement services  and a charge of after tax for withdrawal liability from a multi employer pension plan 
the remaining loss from discontinued operations during was the result of operating losses 
in we will have additional costs related to our ongoing program to clear the site  recover assets and dispose of the detroit property  although the total amount of such costs are not currently estimable 
there can be no assurance  however  that items will not require additional expenditures beyond those that are anticipated and that additional expenditures  if any  would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
disclosure about critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the company s annual consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant  difficult or complex judgments by management  often employing the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimation methodologies are applied consistently from year to year in material respects 
the following is a summary of accounting policies management considers critical to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time title transfers to the customer generally upon shipment of products 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of goods sold 
rebates and discounts expenses directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
the rebates and discounts accruals require the use of management estimates and the consideration of contractual arrangements subject to interpretation 
customer sales that reach certain award levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from these estimates 
future market conditions may require increased incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction in net sales at the time the incentive is offered 
inventories the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out  or fifo  method to determine the cost of raw materials and finished goods 
this cost includes raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
our policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in estimates of net realizable value are manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
please refer to schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts in this form k for activity in the obsolescence reserve over the past three years 
accounts receivable accounts receivable from sales to customers are unsecured  and we value accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances are based on estimates of the portion of the receivables that will not be collected in the future 
however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is significantly dependent upon the financial condition of the individual customer  which can change rapidly and without advance warning 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts by looking at a variety of factors 
first we examine an aging of the accounts receivable 
the aging lists past due amounts according to invoice terms 
in addition  we consider the current economic environment  the credit rating of the customers and general overall market conditions 
if we determine that a customer is unlikely to pay  we record a charge to bad debt expense in the income statement and an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
please refer to schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts in this form k for activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three years 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover any future non payments of our customers 
however  if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of our large customers was to declare bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in accordance with sfas in addition  the remaining amortization period for the impaired asset would be reassessed and revised if necessary 
provisions for depreciation have been computed principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives generally years for buildings  to years for improvements  to years for machinery and equipment and to years for computer software 
the company amortizes intangible assets with definitive lives over varying periods 
deferred financing fees are amortized using the effective interest method over the lives of the respective debt agreements 
customer contracts and customer relationships are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated lives of the contracts and relationships 
covenants not to compete are amortized using the straight line method over the lives of the agreements 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
sfas requires that if the carrying value of a reporting unit for which goodwill exists exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  we have evaluated our goodwill for impairment and have determined that the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying value  so we did not recognize an impairment of goodwill 
our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments 
goodwill of approximately  is shown on our balance sheet as of december  we believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of our reporting units is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about the future cash flows for each reporting unit over several years in the future  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our results of operations could be material 
management s assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today 
in estimating future cash flows  we use internally generated projections reviewed by management 
we develop our projections based upon recent sales trends  discussions with our customers  planned timing of new product launches  forecasted capital expenditure needs  working capital needs  costing factors and many other variables 
from these internally generated projections  a projection of cash flows is made based upon expected sales growth rates and capital and working capital requirements 
we believe our assumptions used in discounting future cash flows are appropriately conservative 
any increase in estimated cash flows would have no impact on the reported carrying amount of goodwill 
however  if our current estimates of discounted cash flow had been approximately lower for our food packaging reporting unit and approximately lower for our specialty laminations reporting unit  the fair value of the reporting unit would have been lower than the carrying value thus requiring us to perform an impairment test to determine the implied value of goodwill 
stock based compensation as of december   we followed apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and the related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
issued subsequent to apb no 
 defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock options using the intrinsic value based method prescribed in apb no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that beginning with the first quarter of adoption of sfas r compensation expense will be recorded for stock options and restricted stock as such items vest  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all stock options and restricted stock as they vest beginning with the first period restated 
see note to the company s annual consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in calculating the fair values of employee stock option plans 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas however  in accordance with sfas no 
 we have been disclosing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the impact on our net income and earnings per share had we adopted the fair value based method 
if we had adopted the fair value based method in  our net income would have been lower than reported or approximately 
diluted earnings per share lower than reported 
if we had applied the fair value based method and recorded the additional after tax expense of  it would not have had a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources because the expense is non cash 
further  non cash expenses relating to the granting of options are excluded as an expense in determining ebitda for purposes of our debt covenants 
income taxes in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal and state authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions  and management believes these reserves are adequate 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if the company prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
no valuation allowance is considered necessary as of december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  was available under the revolving portion of our credit facility the senior credit facility  after taking into account  in letters of credit outstanding and of revolver borrowings 
our working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  due primarily to the acquisition of papercon 
our primary short term and long term operating cash requirements are for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and dividends 
we expect to rely on cash generated from operations supplemented by revolver borrowings under the senior credit facility to fund short term and long term cash requirements 
during the third quarter of  the company amended the senior credit facility to provide for an additional  of term b loans and an increase in the revolving credit facility to  up to  of which may be in the form of letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is due in as of december   the term a loan had an outstanding balance of  and will mature in the required aggregate annual payments  payable in quarterly installments  total    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   the term b loan had a outstanding balance of  and will mature in the aggregate annual payments  payable in equal quarterly installments  total in years through and  in the revolver had a balance of as of december  the company generated   and  of cash from operating activities during  and  respectively 
the increase from compared to was primarily due to incremental cash from operating activities from papercon partially offset by a decrease in cash from discontinued operating activities 
the decrease in cash from operating activities from compared to was primarily related to an increased investment in working capital 
cash used by discontinued operating activities was  during compared with cash from discontinued operations of  and  during and  respectively 
the cash generated and used by discontinued operating activities is a result of ongoing efforts to clear the site and dispose of the detroit property 
such costs are expected to continue until the property is sold 
cash used by investing activities was   and  during  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in continuing operations investing activities during was primarily associated with the papercon acquisition 
cash used for additions to property  plant and equipment was   and  in  and  respectively 
major capital expenditures in were for information technology upgrades  manufacturing equipment upgrades as well as building and office improvements 
in capital expenditures included  of investment in new bag making equipment in our food packaging operating segment  increased investment in information technology infrastructure and upgrades to our manufacturing facilities 
financing activities generated cash of  during compared to a use of  and  during and  respectively 
the cash generated in the current year was primarily related to the senior credit facility borrowings in connection with the acquisition of papercon 
in october  the company reduced the revolver balance by  primarily by using the cash acquired in the papercon acquisition 
during  the company paid cash dividends of  compared with zero during and in addition  in december  the company announced a cash dividend of per common share  in the aggregate  which was paid on january  to shareholders of record on december  loans under the senior credit facility are designated from time to time  at our election  either as eurodollar rate loans  which bear interest at a rate based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  adjusted for regulatory reserve requirements  or as base rate loans  which bear interest at a rate based on the federal funds rate or the prime rate 
the interest rate on eurodollar rate loans is equal to libor plus an applicable percentage that varies with the leverage ratio of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the interest rate on base rate loans is equal to a base rate equal to the greater of the federal funds rate plus of or the prime rate  plus an applicable percentage that varies with the leverage ratio of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
accordingly  term a loans and revolving loans bear interest at rates of up to plus the base rate  in the case of base rate loans  and up to plus libor  in the case of eurodollar loans 
term b loans bear interest at rates of plus the base rate  in the case of base rate loans  and plus libor  in the case of eurodollar loans 
at december   the interest rates on borrowings under the term a loan and the term b loan were plus libor and plus libor  respectively  compared with plus libor and plus libor  respectively  at december  to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt  the company has entered into interest rate derivative instruments  which are discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the stock and assets of our operating subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility and term a loan will terminate on september  and the term b loan will terminate on september  under the senior credit facility  as amended  we are required to comply on a quarterly basis with the following four financial covenants under the leverage ratio covenant  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  the ratio of total funded debt of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries to consolidated ebitda of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the month period then ended must not exceed specified levels  decreasing from to at december  to to  under the senior secured leverage ratio covenant  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  the ratio of total secured funded debt of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries to consolidated ebitda of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the month period then ended must not exceed specified levels  decreasing from to at december  to to  under the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  for the month period then ended  the ratio of consolidated ebitda less capital expenditures and cash tax payments of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries to cash interest expense and scheduled funded debt payments excluding the  seller note issued in connection with the papercon acquisition of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries must be equal to or greater than certain specified levels  increasing from to at december  to to  and under the net worth covenant  packaging dynamics consolidated net worth as of the last day of each fiscal quarter must be equal to or greater than of the net worth as of september  increased on a cumulative basis by as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  of the consolidated net income of packaging dynamics to the extent positive for the fiscal quarter then ended  of the net cash proceeds from any equity issuance by packaging dynamics or any subsidiary of packaging dynamics  and of the amount added to the equity of packaging dynamics in accordance with gaap in connection with the papercon acquisition 
for purposes of the senior credit facility  as amended  consolidated ebitda  calculated on a consolidated basis for packaging dynamics and its subsidiaries  consists of net income from continuing operations  excluding the effect of any extraordinary or other non recurring gains or losses or non cash gains or losses in each case  other than in connection with the sale and or closure of the detroit paper mill  plus an amount which  in the determination of net income  has been deducted for interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash expenses relating to the granting of options  cash and non cash charges and or losses with respect to the sale and or closure of the detroit paper mill  and charges related to the papercon owner bonus program prior to the date of acquisition by the company  minus cash expenditures related to non cash charges previously added back to net income in determining ebitda other than in connection with the closure of the detroit paper mill  plus the write off of capitalized financing costs existing as of the closing of the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility also contains various negative covenants that  among other things  require packaging dynamics and its subsidiaries to limit future borrowings and payments to related parties and restricts packaging dynamics ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to merge or consolidate 
in addition  the senior credit facility prohibits changes in the nature of business conducted by the company and its subsidiaries 
the failure to comply with the covenants would result in a default under the senior credit facility and permit the lenders under the senior credit facility to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness governed by the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility includes terms that limit changes in our ownership structure 
modifications to the ownership structure outside the limits prescribed by such agreements could place us in default under these debt instruments 
the senior credit facility requires pdoc to maintain specified financial ratios and levels of tangible net worth as discussed above 
pdoc was in compliance with those covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations under the senior credit facility  as of december  and foreclosure on the collateral securing those obligations

recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb released fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter which we refer to as sfas 
sfas is the result of the fasb s efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect sfas to have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp s that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of the act that was signed into law on october  the act could affect how companies report their deferred income tax balances 
the first fsp is fsp fas fas  the second is fsp fas fas 
in fas  the fasb concludes that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from the act should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
as a domestic manufacturer the company will assess early in whether the company is eligible for any tax deductions under this act 
fas gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the act on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we expect fas to have no impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use interest rate swaps  collars and caps to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs 
we have designated these instruments as cash flow hedges and consider these instruments effective at offsetting our risk to variable interest rates on debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt instruments that are benchmarked to libor 
as of december   we had interest rate instruments in effect with banks having notional amounts totaling  and varying maturity dates through december  we had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of  which became effective on december  and matures on december  this swap fixes our libor rate for  of our senior credit facility indebtedness at a rate of 
we also entered into an interest rate collar agreement with a notional amount of  which became effective on december  and matures on december  this collar will result in our paying market libor rates for  of our senior credit facility indebtedness from a floor of to a cap of 
in addition to these two instruments  we had two interest rate caps of  each which became effective on december  for a cap premium of these caps limit our libor rate for  of our senior credit facility indebtedness at a maximum rate of 
a unfavorable movement in libor would not expose us to material losses of earnings or cash flows 
income or expense related to settlements under these agreements is recorded as adjustments to interest expense in our financial statements 
the fair market value of our derivative instruments outlined above approximates a asset as of december  and is based upon the amount at which it could be settled with a third party  although we have no current intention to trade any of these instruments and plan to hold them as hedges for the senior credit facility 
the changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments  net of income tax  was recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
substantially all of our sales  including export sales  are denominated in united states dollars in order to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
