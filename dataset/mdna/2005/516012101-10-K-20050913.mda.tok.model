all share and per share amounts on this form k have been adjusted to reflect a three for two stock split effective on february  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies include those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when its products are shipped 
at this point  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and provisions for estimates  including rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as rebates and chargebacks payable and reductions to net sales 
the change in the reserves for various sales adjustments may not be proportionally equal to the change in sales because of changes in both the product and the customer mix 
increased sales to wholesalers will generally require additional rebates 
incentives offered to secure sales vary from product to product 
provisions for estimated rebates and promotional and other credits are estimated based on historical payment experience  customer inventory levels  and contract terms 
provisions for other customer credits  such as price adjustments  returns  and chargebacks  require management to make subjective judgments 
unlike branded innovator drug companies  lannett does not use information about product levels in distribution channels from third party sources  such as ims and ndc health  in estimating future returns and other credits 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic distributors  retail pharmacy chains  and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price if the price sold to the indirect customer is lower than the direct price to the wholesaler 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen  and mckesson  increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the product mix 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key customers to promote customer loyalty and encourage greater product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
at the time of shipment  the company estimates reserves for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement 
the reserve for rebates increases as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase 
however  these rebate programs are tailored to the customers individual programs 
hence  the reserve will depend on the mix of customers that comprise such rebate programs 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product returns policy that allows select customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product s lot expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  changes to business practices  and credit terms 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors the provisions for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase 
the reserve for returns is included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
other adjustments other adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  which are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated declines in market prices  and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
other adjustments are included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
the following tables identify the reserves for each major category of revenue allowance and a summary of the activity for the years ended june  and for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june       actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal      actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal      additional reserves charged to net sales during fiscal      reserve balance as of june       for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june       actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal     actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal      additional reserves charged to net sales during fiscal      reserve balance as of june       the company ships its products to the warehouses of its wholesale and retail chain customers 
when the company and a customer come to an agreement for the supply of a product  the customer will generally continue to purchase the product  stock its warehouse s  and resell the product to its own customers 
the company s customer will continually reorder the product as its warehouse is depleted 
the company generally has no minimum size orders for its customers 
additionally  most warehousing customers prefer not to stock excess inventory levels due to the additional carrying costs and inefficiencies created by holding excess inventory 
as such  the company s customers continually reorder the company s products 
it is common for the company s customers to order the same products on a monthly basis 
for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  it is critical to ensure that customers warehouses are adequately stocked with its products 
this is important due to the fact that several generic competitors compete for the consumer demand for a given product 
availability of inventory ensures that a manufacturer s product is considered 
otherwise  retail prescriptions would be filled with competitors products 
for this reason  the company periodically offers incentives to its customers to purchase its products 
these incentives are generally up front discounts off its standard prices at the beginning of a generic campaign launch for a newly approved or newly introduced product  or when a customer purchases a lannett product for the first time 
customers generally inform the company that such purchases represent an estimate of expected resale for a period of time 
this period of time is generally up to three months 
the company records this revenue  net of any discounts offered and accepted by its customers at the time of shipment 
the company s products have either months or months of shelf life at the time of manufacture 
the company monitors its customers purchasing trends to attempt to identify any significant lapses in purchasing activity 
if the company observes a lack of recent activity  inquiries will be made to such customer regarding the success of the customer s resale efforts 
the company attempts to minimize any potential return or shelf life issues by maintaining an active dialogue with the customers 
the products that the company sells are generic versions of brand named drugs 
the consumer markets for such drugs are well established markets with many years of historically confirmed consumer demand 
such consumer demand may be affected by several factors  including alternative treatments  cost  etc 
however  the effects of changes in such consumer demand for the company s products  like generic products manufactured by other generic companies  are gradual in nature 
any overall decrease in consumer demand for generic products generally occurs over an extended period of time 
this is because there are thousands of doctors  prescribers  third party payers  institutional formularies and other buyers of drugs that must change prescribing habits and medicinal practices before such a decrease would affect a generic drug market 
if the historical data the company uses and the assumptions management makes to calculate its estimates of future returns  chargebacks  and other credits do not accurately approximate future activity  its net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could change 
however  management believes that these estimates are reasonable based upon historical experience and current conditions 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the both company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market  regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand  and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements 
the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case it may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have recognized excess cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
intangible asset on march   the company entered into an agreement with jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp for the exclusive marketing and distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of the jsp agreement  the company recorded an intangible asset of  for the exclusive marketing and distribution rights obtained from jsp 
the intangible asset was recorded based upon the fair value of the four million  shares at the time of issuance to jsp 
an impairment charge was recorded against this intangible asset in the current fiscal year 
the agreement was included as an exhibit in the form k filed by the company on may   as subsequently amended 
in june  jsp s levothyroxine sodium tablet product received from the fda an ab rating to the brand drug levoxyl r

as a result of the dual ab ratings  the company was required to pay jsp an additional million in cash to reimburse jsp for expenses related to obtaining the ab ratings 
as of march   the company recorded an addition to the intangible asset of million 
management believes that events occurred during fiscal which indicated that the carrying value of the intangible asset was not recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist in the performance of an impairment test for the quarter ended march  the impairment test was performed by discounting forecasted future net cash flows for the jsp products covered under the agreement and then comparing the discounted present value of those cash flows to the carrying value of the asset inclusive of the million paid to jsp for the duel ab ratings 
as a result of the testing  the company determined that the intangible asset was impaired as of march  in accordance with fas  the company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately  to write the asset down to its fair value of approximately  as of the date of the impairment 
this impairment loss is shown on the statement of operations as a component of operating loss 
management concluded that  as of june   the intangible asset is correctly stated at fair value and  therefore  no adjustment was required 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter paragraph of arb  chapter previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

apb opinion no 
requires a nonmonetary exchange of assets be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gain or loss  if the exchange meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable 
the commercial substance criterion is assessed by comparing the entity s expected cash flows immediately before and after the exchange 
sfas no 
eliminates the similar productive assets exception  which accounts for the exchange of assets at book value with no recognition of gain or loss 
sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements

it also provides guidance for determining whether an award is a liability classified award or an equity classified award  and determining fair value 
sfas no 
r applies to all unvested stock based payment awards outstanding as of the adoption date 
pursuant to a rule announced by the securities and exchange commission in april  sfas no

sfas no 
will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no

we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that a conditional retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the liability should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  construction or development of the asset 
fin is effective no later than the end of the fiscal years ending after december  we have not completed an assessment of the impact that adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was generally due to increased competition in the generic drug market that affected most of the company s products 
the increased competition  both from existing competitors and new entrants  has resulted in significant price pressures 
sales of the levothyroxine sodium line of products declined by  due in part to a delay in the ab rating  which gave the competition a market advantage 
the sales of unithroid tablets declined  sales of butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules declined  sales of primidone tablets  seeing competition for the first time  declined  sales of digoxin tablets declined  the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below identifies the company s net sales to each category 
customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million million retail chain million million million mail order pharmacy million million million private label million million million total million million million sales in every category  with the exception of mail order pharmacy  decreased the past year 
this is a result of the factors described in the previous paragraph 
sales to mail order pharmacy increased due to an increase in product line  and a general increase across the business sector 
sales to wholesalers distributors declined mainly due to the loss of primary position on the amerisource bergen pro generic contract and a decrease in pricing with all wholesalers and distributors due to the competitive market 
cost of sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal these costs include raw materials cost of finished goods purchased and resold  which increased approximately  shipping expense  which increased by approximately  and other miscellaneous production related expenses which increased in total by approximately  gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin is a result of a decrease in net weighted average prices from some of the company s products due to increased market competition  increases in direct and indirect costs as well as a change in the product sales mix 
depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development r d expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in r d is a result of contracting formulation development out to a third party laboratory for product development for  in fiscal  and an increase of raw material consumption of approximately  used in the development and formulation of new products not yet approved by the fda 
these costs were offset by a decrease in bio studies of  from fiscal to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is primarily a result of sarbanes oxley related accounting and consulting costs of approximately  and an increase in insurance of  these increases were partially offset by savings in various other expense accounts 
the company s interest expense increased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal as a result of the borrowing under the loan financing which included a mortgage loan  equipment loan and construction loan  each of which started in fiscal interest income increased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately in fiscal  as a result of investment of excess cash in marketable securities and a higher cash balance 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp for the exclusive marketing and distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of the jsp agreement  the company recorded an intangible asset of  for the exclusive marketing and distribution rights obtained from jsp 
an impairment charge was recorded against this intangible asset in the current fiscal year 
the intangible asset was recorded based upon the fair value of the four million  shares at the time of issuance to jsp 
the agreement was included as an exhibit in the current report on form k filed by the company on may   as subsequently amended 
in june  jsp s levothyroxine sodium tablet product received from the fda an ab rating to the brand drug levoxyl r

as a result of the dual ab ratings  the company was required to pay jsp an additional million in cash to reimburse jsp for expenses related to obtaining the ab ratings 
as of june   the company had recorded an addition to the intangible asset of million 
management believed that events as described in the next paragraph occurred during fiscal which indicated that the carrying value of the intangible asset was not recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist in the performance of an impairment test for the quarter ended march  the impairment test was performed by discounting forecasted future net cash flows for the jsp products covered under the agreement and then comparing the discounted present value of those cash flows to the carrying value of the asset inclusive of the million paid to jsp for the dual ab ratings 
as a result of the testing  the company determined that the intangible asset was impaired as of march  in accordance with fas  the company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately  to write the asset down to its fair value of approximately  as of march  this impairment loss is shown on the statement of operations as a component of operating loss 
several factors contributed to the impairment of this asset 
in december  the levothyroxine sodium tablet product received the ab rating to synthroid r 
the expected sales increase as a result of the ab rating did not occur in the third quarter of the delay in receiving the ab rating to synthroid r caused the company to be competitively disadvantaged with its levothyroxine sodium tablet product and to lose market share to competitors whose products had already received ab ratings to both major brand thyroid deficiency drugs 
additionally  the generic market for thyroid deficiency drugs turned out to be smaller than it was anticipated to be as a result of a lower brand to generic substitution rate 
increased competition in the generic drug market  both from existing competitors and new entrants  has resulted in significant pricing pressure on other products supplied by jsp 
the combination of these factors has resulted in diminished forecasted future net cash flows which  when discounted  yield a lower present value than the carrying value of the asset before impairment 
for the remaining nine years of the contract  the company will incur annual amortization expense of approximately  amortization expense for the fiscal year ended june  and was approximately  and  respectively 
as a result of the items discussed above  the company s financial results changed from an operating income of  in fiscal to an operating loss of  in fiscal the company s income tax classification changed from an income tax expense of  in fiscal to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal as a result of the company s pre tax loss 
the effective tax rate increased slightly from in to in the company reported net loss of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted loss per share  compared to net income of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal sales increased as a result of additions to the company s prescription line of products  including digoxin tablets  first marketed in september  levothyroxine sodium tablets  first marketed in april and unithroid tablets  first marketed in august these product additions had the effect of increasing the total net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the fact the company sold the products for longer periods of time in the twelve months ended june  these product additions accounted for approximately million of the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal additionally  sales of a portion of the company s previously marketed products  such as primidone tablets  butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules and dicyclomine hcl tablets and capsules increased by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal as a result of new customer accounts  increased unit sales and increased unit sales prices 
the company from time to time will raise its sales prices if there is an increase in the price of the brand named drug 
generally  the company sells its products at the accepted market prices for such products 
if the competitive environment changes  the company monitors such changes to determine the effect on the market prices for its products 
such changes may include new competitors  fewer competitors  or an increase in the price of the innovator drug 
the increase in sales of a portion of the company s products was partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products  including butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules which decreased million due to increased competition and a discontinuation of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride tablets which resulted in a loss of sales of 
the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below identifies the company s net sales to each category 
customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million million retail chain million million million mail order pharmacy million million million private label million million million total million million million sales in every category  with the exception of private label  increased each of the past three years 
this is a result of the factors described in the previous paragraph 
sales to private label customers decreased in fiscal and as a result of the company s successful efforts in growing the lannett label accounts 
increasing sales to customers that purchased the lannett label products ie the wholesale  retail  and mail order customer categories had the effect of reducing sales to private label customers 
cost of sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the cost of sales increase is due to an increase in direct variable costs and certain indirect costs as a result of the increase in sales volume  and related production activities 
these costs include raw materials cost of finished goods purchased and resold  which increased approximately  labor and benefits expenses  which increased by approximately  and other miscellaneous production related expenses which increased in total by approximately  gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margins is a result of a decrease in net weighted average prices from some of the company s products due to increased market competition  increases in direct and indirect costs as well as a change in the product sales mix 
during fiscal  a larger percentage of the company s total net sales were from products supplied by jsp 
the company s average gross profit margin for products from jsp is less than the average gross profit margin for products internally manufactured 
depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development r d expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in the costs of generic bioequivalence tests which are commonly required for anda submissions 
the company incurred approximately million in fiscal for bioequivalence testing fees  compared to approximately  in fiscal the increase in r d is also a result of an increase in the number of chemists in the r d laboratory and the related payroll and benefits expenses  which increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase of raw material consumption of approximately  used in the development and formulation of new products not yet approved by the fda 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is a result of an increase in the following expenses payroll incentive compensation and benefits  which increased by approximately million  consulting services  which increased by approximately  including sarbanes oxley consulting  legal expenses  which increased by approximately  computer support costs  which increased by approximately  advertising expenses  which increased by approximately  travel and entertainment expenses  which increased by approximately  insurance expenses  which increased by approximately  investor relations marketing expenses  which increased by approximately  directors fees  which increased by approximately  and miscellaneous other expenses  including utilities  training  general and safety supplies  office supplies  accounting fees  telephone and rent expense

refer to note for further discussion 
except as set forth in this report  the company is not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the company s short term or long term liquidity or financial condition 
prospects for the future the company has several generic products under development 
these products are all orally administered  products designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
as the oldest generic drug manufacturer in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  so as to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling it 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  or the raw material supplier of the previously approved anda 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
a majority of the products in development represent either previously approved andas that the company is planning to reintroduce anda supplements  or new formulations new andas 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  and or clinical testing 
depending on the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the cost of the raw material  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies  the cost of such studies and other developmental factors  the cost to develop a new generic product varies 
it can range from  to million 
some of lannett s developmental products will require bioequivalence studies  while others will not depending on the fda s orange book classification 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping additional products 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with an outside firm for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to compliment the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
occasionally the company will work on developing a drug product that does not require fda approval 
the fda allows generic manufacturers to manufacture and sell products which are equivalent to innovator drugs which are grand fathered  under fda rules  prior to the passage of the hatch waxman act of the fda allows generic manufacturers to produce and sell generic versions of such grand fathered products by simply performing and internally documenting the product s stability over a period of time 
under this scenario  a generic company can forego the time required for fda anda approval 
the company has also contracted with spectrum pharmaceuticals inc  based in california  to market generic products developed and manufactured by spectrum and or its partners 
the first applicable product under this agreement is ciprofloxacin tablets  the generic version of cipro r  an anti bacterial drug  marketed by bayer corporation  prescribed to treat infections 
the company has also initiated discussions with unichem  of india  and orion pharma  of finland  for similar new product initiatives  in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development and manufacturing supply  including spectrum pharmaceuticals inc  are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
the company plans to enhance relationships with strategic business partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as finished goods 
management believes that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could allow for potential competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
for example  the company has entered into prepayment arrangements in exchange for discounted purchase prices on certain active pharmaceutical ingredients api and oral dosage forms 
the company has also arranged for a loan to a certain api provider that should facilitate the availability of difficult to source material in the future 
the company plans to continue to explore such areas for potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value
