we also sell scientific instrumentation products  provide technical maintenance for our products and offer compliance training services for the transport of infectious and biological specimens 
during fiscal  as part of our acquisition integration plan  we combined our two water treatment companies  biolab and mar cor  and a portion of the non medical filter business of minntech s filtration technologies group  to form a single business operation known as mar cor purification 
as a result of this restructuring  we have modified our reporting segments to reflect the way we manage  allocate resources and measure the performance of our business 
commencing with the fiscal year ended july   the operations of mar cor purification  together with the portion of the non medical filter business of minntech s filtration technologies group remaining with minntech  are being reported in a new reporting segment  water purification and filtration 
the medical filter business of minntech s filtration technologies group is being reported in a new operating segment  therapeutic filtration  which is included in the all other reporting segment 
the biolab and mar cor businesses were previously reported as the water treatment reporting segment  and minntech s entire filtration technologies group was previously reported as the filtration and separation reporting segment 
all prior period segment results have been restated to reflect this change

results of operations the results of operations reflect the results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
since the crosstex acquisition occurred subsequent to the end of fiscal  it had no impact upon our results of operations for any of the years presented 
since the saf t pak acquisition occurred on june   saf t pak is reflected in our results of operations for fiscal and for the last two months of fiscal  but is excluded from our fiscal results of operations 
the acquisition of saf t pak added the specialty packaging operating segment  which is included in the all other reporting segment 
since the biolab and mar cor acquisitions occurred on august   biolab and mar cor are reflected in our results of operations for fiscal and  but are excluded from our fiscal results of operations 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to the dialysis  endoscopy and surgical  endoscope reprocessing  and water purification and filtration reporting segments and the scientific and therapeutic filtration operating segments  which are included in the all other reporting segment  but excludes the impact of the saf t pak acquisition 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to the dialysis  endoscopy and surgical  endoscope reprocessing and all other reporting segments  as well as the portion of minntech s filtration technologies group included in the water purification and filtration reporting segment  but excludes the impact of the biolab  mar cor and saf t pak acquisitions 
the following table gives information as to the net sales and the percentage to the total net sales accounted for by each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands dialysis endoscopy and surgical endoscope reprocessing water purification and filtration all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  for fiscal from  in fiscal net sales contributed by saf t pak in fiscal and the last two months of fiscal were  and  respectively 
net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s and biolab s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
carsen s net sales are principally included in the endoscopy and surgical reporting segment and the scientific operating segment  which is included in the all other reporting segment 
biolab s net sales are included in the water purification and filtration reporting segment 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of minntech s netherlands subsidiary net sales using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
the majority of the net sales of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are included in the dialysis reporting segment 
increases in selling prices of our products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services  scientific products  endoscope reprocessing products and services  dialysis products and therapeutic products 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by a small decrease in sales of water purification and filtration products 
the increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services was primarily due to improved healthcare funding in canada  the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  enhanced offerings of surgical products and the effect of reorganizing carsen s sales force 
net sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services increased by in united states dollars as compared with in their functional canadian currency during fiscal as compared with fiscal healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations 
canada has adopted a budget that provides for a significant increase in funding for healthcare 
however  we cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation or canada s budget will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services of in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to an increase in sales of disinfectants  consumables and product service  both in the united states and internationally 
the increase in sales of these products can be attributed to the increased field population of equipment including our dyped endoscope disinfection equipment in europe and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
sales of dialysis products and services increased by in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in customer demand in the united states and by an international customer for concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment and an increase in domestic demand for dialysis supplies 
partially offsetting the increase in sales were lower average selling prices for our renalin sterilant product due to increased sales to large national chains that typically receive lower prices 
the dialysis industry has been undergoing significant consolidation through the acquisition by certain major dialysis chains of smaller chains and independents 
in october  davita inc davita  the second largest dialysis chain in the united states  acquired gambro ab s united states dialysis clinic business  gambro healthcare  inc gambro us 
in addition  in may  fresenius medical care ag fresenius  the largest dialysis chain in the united states and a provider of single use dialyzer products  announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire renal care group  inc rcg 
davita  gambro us  and rcg are significant customers of our dialysis reuse products 
if fresenius s acquisition is consummated  and if fresenius converts all or substantially all of the dialysis clinics of rcg into single use facilities  our sales of dialysis products will be adversely affected 
in addition  the consolidation of dialysis providers could result in greater buying power by the larger resulting entities and thereby a reduction in our net sales and profit margins due to reduced average selling prices of dialysis products 
however  given the uncertainty of the post acquisition operating strategies with respect to these two transactions and the potential regulatory required divesture of some of their dialysis clinics  we are currently unable to determine the impact on our future sales of dialysis products and services 
sales in the all other reporting segment increased in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment in fiscal were  an increase of  compared with the last two months of fiscal subsequent to the date of the acquisition 
net sales contributed by the scientific operating segment were  an increase of  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales of scientific products was primarily due to the introduction of a new confocal microscope  increased demand in canada for scientific and industrial microscopes and related imaging products  improved government funding for research in canada and a large sale of microscopes and related imaging products to a canadian university 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales of therapeutic products was primarily due to an increase in customer demand for our pediatric filters in the united states and domestic and international demand for our hemofilters a device that performs a slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients who cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis 
sales of water purification and filtration products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the recognition of certain large low margin water purification equipment sales during fiscal  which orders had been accepted prior to the acquisition of biolab 
after the acquisition was completed  we made a decision not to sell our water purification equipment at such a low margin  thereby resulting in lower but more profitable sales 
partially offsetting this decrease were an increase in demand for our water filtration products in the united states and international sales of our new minncare dry fog disinfection system 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by saf t pak in fiscal and the last two months of fiscal were  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was  compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales for saf t pak in fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the higher gross profit percentage from our pre existing business in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable canadian dollar exchange rates  which principally impact the endoscopy and surgical and the water purification and filtration reporting segments and the scientific operating segment 
the higher gross profit percentage was also due to improved overhead absorption due to increased sales volume as well as favorable sales mix in our endoscope reprocessing and therapeutic filtration reporting segments 
partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage was a lower gross profit percentage on our dialysis products due to sales mix as we sold more concentrate products and a lower average selling price on concentrate as a result of increased sales to large national chains that typically receive lower prices 
the favorable canadian dollar exchange rates lowered carsen s and biolab s cost of inventory purchased from suppliers in the united states  and therefore decreased cost of sales and increased gross profit  by approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal in addition  gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s and biolab s gross profit using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which also impacts net sales and therefore has no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
similarly  gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of minntech s netherlands subsidiary gross profit using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the translation of carsen s and biolab s expenses using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of selling expenses  the inclusion of an additional  of saf t pak s selling expenses for fiscal as compared with the last two months of fiscal  the addition of sales representatives and management personnel primarily in the endoscopy and surgical reporting segment  and increases in commissions and incentive compensation except in our dialysis reporting segment due to improved operating results 
partially offsetting the increase in selling expenses were decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry since an increasing percentage of our sales of our dialysis products are to major dialysis chains as compared to small chains and independent dialysis clinics 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of increased net sales against the fixed component of selling expenses  and decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of an additional  of saf t pak s general and administrative expenses for fiscal as compared with the last two months of fiscal  increased accounting and consulting costs of approximately  relating to corporate governance sarbanes oxley compliance and the annual audit of our financial statements  an increase in incentive compensation of approximately  an increase of approximately  due to additional executive personnel  a  impairment charge primarily related to the cancellation of a computer system installation due to the termination of carsen s olympus distribution business on july   and the translation of carsen s and biolab s expenses using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in bad debt expense due to the collection of several delinquent receivables and a  provision for legal claims recorded during fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the majority of research and development expenses for fiscal and fiscal related to the dyped endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
interest in fiscal  interest expense decreased by  to  from  in fiscal  principally due to the decrease in average outstanding borrowings  partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  principally due to an increase in cash available for short term investments 
income before taxes income before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
we have provided income tax expense for our united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of united states federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards nols accumulated in the united states 
at july   such federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately  since these nols will be fully utilized in fiscal  we will be making payments of united states federal income taxes during fiscal our united states effective tax rate was during fiscal compared with during fiscal our results of operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for our international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include our subsidiaries in canada  and japan  which had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately and  respectively 
in fiscal and  minntech s netherlands subsidiary had an overall loss primarily due to research and development expenses attributable to the dyped product line for which no corresponding tax benefit was recorded 
as a result  our consolidated effective tax rate of is higher than our united states and canadian effective tax rates 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales contributed by biolab  mar cor and saf t pak in fiscal were  net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  for fiscal compared with fiscal net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
carsen s net sales are principally included in the endoscopy and surgical reporting segment and scientific operating segment 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of minntech s netherlands subsidiary net sales using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
the majority of the net sales of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are included in the dialysis reporting segment 
increases in selling prices of our products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services and endoscope reprocessing products and services 
the increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services was primarily due to improved healthcare funding in canada  the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  the decrease in volume during certain periods of fiscal due to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the greater toronto area which prevented our sales personnel from visiting hospitals  enhanced offerings of surgical products and the effect of reorganizing carsen s sales force 
net sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services increased by in united states dollars and in their functional canadian currency during fiscal as compared with fiscal healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations 
canada recently adopted a budget that provides for a significant increase in funding for healthcare 
however  we cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation or the new budget will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and service of in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to an increase in sales volume for endoscope disinfection equipment in the united states  and an increase in endoscope reprocessing consumables and product service due to increased volume related to the increased field population of equipment 
sales of dialysis products and services increased by in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales volume of the number of units of our concentrate product a concentrated acid used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment to several major dialysis chains in the united states and to a new international customer  partially offset by a decrease in demand for our renatron product dialyzer reprocessing equipment as well as lower selling prices for our renalin products sterilant 
sales of therapeutic products which is included in the all other reporting segment increased by  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in demand for our hemoconcentrator product a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and hemofilter product a device used for slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients that cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis 
the increase in demand for our hemoconcentrator product was partially due to the departure of a competitor from the international hemoconcentrator market 
partially offsetting the increase in sales of hemoconcentrators and hemofilters was the completion of a private label manufacturing contract in fiscal which was not replaced with a similar contract in fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by biolab  mar cor and saf t pak in fiscal was  gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or to  in fiscal as compared with fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for biolab  mar cor and saf t pak in fiscal was 
the higher gross profit percentage from our pre existing business in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable canadian dollar exchange rates during fiscal  improved overhead absorption in the endoscope reprocessing reporting segment due to increased volume  favorable sales mix in the endoscopy and surgical segment and minntech s water filtration business which is included in the water purification and filtration reporting segment  and higher charges for warranty and slow moving inventory related to our endoscope reprocessing products incurred during fiscal partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage were a lower gross profit percentage in our dialysis products due to increased sales of concentrate products which typically carry a lower gross profit  a lower gross profit percentage in the service portion of the endoscope reprocessing reporting segment due to sales mix of services provided and a  charge including a  impairment charge to write down certain assets during fiscal for costs pertaining to the closing of our boston dialyzer reprocessing center 
the favorable canadian dollar exchange rates lowered carsen s cost of inventory purchased  and therefore decreased cost of sales and increased gross profit  by approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal in addition  gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s gross profit using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which also impacts net sales and therefore has no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to  of biolab s  mar cor s and saf t pak s fiscal selling expenses  an increase in incentive compensation of approximately  the translation of carsen s expenses using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  and the addition of sales representatives and management personnel in the endoscopy and surgical reporting segment 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease in selling expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of increased net sales against the fixed component of selling expenses  as well as the inclusion of the lower cost structure related to the biolab and mar cor operations  partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation and the addition of sales representatives and management personnel in the endoscopy and surgical reporting segment 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to  of biolab s  mar cor s and saf t pak s fiscal general and administrative expenses  a  provision for legal claims recorded during fiscal  increased costs relating to corporate governance of approximately  in fiscal  favorable adjustments during fiscal in the amounts of  and  resulting from the settlement of liabilities initially recorded in conjunction with the minntech acquisition relating to sales tax and severance  respectively  an increase in incentive compensation of approximately  the translation of carsen s expenses using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  and an increase in the cost of commercial insurance

research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to a reduction in continuing engineering associated with our endoscope reprocessing equipment and the billing of certain research and development services performed under a customer contract 
interest in fiscal  interest expense increased by  to  from  in fiscal principally due to the increased borrowings  net of repayments  under the united states credit facilities for the mar cor and saf t pak acquisitions and incremental amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the amended credit facilities  partially offset by a decrease in average interest rates 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the use of cash to acquire biolab

in conjunction with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of minntech in fiscal  we eliminated the valuation allowances previously existing against our deferred tax assets related to the federal nols accumulated in the united states 
therefore  for all periods subsequent to september   we have provided in our results of operations income tax expense for our united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of united states federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the nols 
at july   such nols were approximately  our results of operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for our international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include our subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands and japan  which had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately  and  respectively

olympus will also acquire carsen s inventory of olympus products as of july  the  payable by olympus is due in three installments   on august  which payment has been received   on january  and  on july  however  the  will not be recognized as revenue until july   the date at which all of our obligations will be fulfilled  even though certain related costs such as severance will be recorded throughout fiscal during fiscal  approximately  of severance was recorded in selling and general and administrative expenses 
net proceeds from the termination of carsen s olympus distribution business are projected to total approximately  such net proceeds will consist of the  to be paid by olympus and proceeds from the sale of inventory and collection of receivables  less satisfaction of liabilities  severance costs  continuing lease obligations and other wind down costs 
management s projection of net proceeds is an estimate based on inventory  receivables and liabilities at july  and assumptions for potential wind down costs  but without taking into account any canadian or united states income tax implications 
we are currently evaluating carsen s remaining non olympus product lines  most of which are aligned with olympus products  to determine their viability without carsen s olympus business 
there can be no assurance that any of such product lines  with the exception of the medivators reprocessors  will be continued after july   or if continued will be profitable or commercially viable 
under the agreement with olympus  we have agreed not to manufacture  distribute  sell or represent for sale in canada through july  any products that are competitive with the olympus products covered by the olympus agreements 
the net sales and operating income attributable to carsen s business inclusive of both olympus and non olympus business  but exclusive of the sale of medivators reprocessors constitute the entire endoscopy and surgical reporting segment and scientific operating segment  which is included within the all other reporting segment 
operating segment information attributable to carsen s business is summarized below fiscal year ended july  net sales endoscopy and surgical endoscope reprocessing scientific included in all other total operating income endoscopy and surgical endoscope reprocessing scientific included in all other total during fiscal and  total net sales of carsen were  and  respectively  which accounted for approximately and of our consolidated net sales during those fiscal years 
approximately of carsen s net sales were attributable to its olympus distribution and service businesses 
operating income of carsen in fiscal and was  and  respectively  or approximately and of our consolidated operating income before general corporate expenses and interest expense 
we are currently evaluating carsen s remaining non olympus product lines  most of which are aligned with olympus products  to determine their viability without carsen s olympus business 
there can be no assurance that any of such product lines  with the exception of the medivators endoscope reprocessors  will be continued after july   or if continued will be profitable or commercially viable 
in july  we reviewed carsen s assets for potential impairment and concluded that certain assets primarily associated with the cancelled installation of a new computer system were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a  impairment charge in fiscal we determined the remainder of carsen s assets were not impaired since the individual fair values exceeded their carrying values 
additionally  we expect to incur certain costs associated with the termination of the olympus agreements  including severance costs  continuing lease obligations and other wind down costs  however at this time it is not possible to precisely estimate the amount of such costs 
in any event  we do not expect costs associated with the termination of the olympus agreements to exceed the  in cash consideration that will be paid by olympus 
minntech olympus distribution agreement the medivators agreement grants olympus the exclusive right to distribute the majority of our endoscope reprocessing products and related accessories and supplies in the united states and puerto rico 
the medivators agreement expires on august  all equipment sold by olympus pursuant to this agreement bears both the olympus and medivators trademarks 
net sales to olympus accounted for  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the medivators agreement provides for minimum purchase requirements during each contract year  which if not met give us the option to terminate the agreement 
although sales to olympus declined slightly during the contract year ended july   olympus achieved its minimum purchase requirements in such contract year 
despite this decline  we believe that olympus domestic distribution capabilities have historically provided us with the broadest distribution and profit potential for our endoscope reprocessing products 
with the medivators agreement due to expire on august   we have initiated discussions with olympus regarding the potential renewal of the agreement 
concurrently  we will evaluate and determine whether to extend the agreement with olympus  seek a new third party distributor  or directly undertake the distribution function after august  if we do not agree to renew the distribution agreement with olympus or  if offered  olympus fails to renew the agreement  we will then be required to engage a new distributor or establish our own direct distribution system in the united states 
financing needs we had a significant cash balance of  at july   the majority of which was held by foreign subsidiaries 
we will repatriate up to  of existing accumulated profits from our international subsidiaries during fiscal this decision was made in connection with the utilization of most of our domestic nols during fiscal we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  and the funds available under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations 
at september   approximately  was available under our revolving credit facilities including  under our us credit facilities 
foreign currency during fiscal compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations principally for the following reasons i carsen purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar  as explained above  lowered carsen s cost of inventory purchased and therefore decreased cost of sales and increased gross profit 
ii biolab and saf t pak purchase a portion of their inventories in united states dollars and sell a significant amount of their products in united states dollars and therefore are exposed to realized foreign currency gains and losses upon payment of such payables and the collection of such receivables 
similarly  such united states denominated assets and liabilities must be converted into their functional canadian currency when preparing their financial statements  which results in realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar  as explained above  primarily resulted in gains for such liabilities and losses for such assets 
since biolab and saf t pak had more assets than liabilities denominated in united states dollars  the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar had an overall adverse effect on our results of operations for fiscal iii the results of operations of our canadian subsidiaries are translated from their functional canadian currency to united states dollars 
the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar  as explained above  had an overall positive impact upon our results of operations due to translating the fiscal results of operations at a higher average currency exchange rate as compared with the average currency exchange rate used to translate the fiscal results of operations 
during fiscal  such strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar had an overall positive impact upon our results of operations 
under our canadian revolving credit facility  we had a  united states dollars foreign currency hedging facility  which is available to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on purchases of inventories 
total commitments for foreign currency forward contracts under this facility amounted to  united states dollars at september  and cover a substantial portion of carsen s projected purchases of inventories through july  which is the end of the olympus distribution agreements 
these foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedge instruments 
the weighted average exchange rate of the forward contracts open at september  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the exchange rate published by the wall street journal on september  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or united states dollar per canadian dollar 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations for the following reasons i minntech s netherlands subsidiary maintains a portion of their cash in united states dollars  sells some of their products in united states dollars and pays various liabilities in united states dollars 
therefore  they are exposed to realized foreign currency gains and losses upon activity in such dollar cash accounts  collection of such receivables and payment of such liabilities 
similarly  such united states denominated assets and liabilities must be converted into their functional euro currency when preparing their financial statements  which results in realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
the increase in the average value of the euro  as explained above  primarily resulted in gains for such liabilities and losses for such assets 
since minntech s netherlands subsidiary had more assets than liabilities denominated in united states dollars  the increase in the average value of the euro had an overall adverse affect on our results of operations for fiscal ii the results of operations of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are translated from its functional euro currency to united states dollars 
the increase in the average value of the euro  as explained above  had an adverse impact upon our results of operations due to translating the fiscal results of operation which had an overall loss at a higher average currency exchange rate as compared with the average currency exchange rate used to translate the fiscal results of operation which also had an overall loss 
during fiscal  such strengthening of the euro relative to the united states dollar had an overall adverse impact upon our results of operations 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts have been designated as fair value hedges 
there was one foreign currency forward contract amounting to  at september  which covers certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars 
such contract expired on september  under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting most of the adverse impact of the strengthening of the euro on our results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all of our foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
recognition of gains and losses related to the canadian hedges is deferred within other comprehensive income until settlement of the underlying commitments  and realized gains and losses are recorded within cost of sales upon settlement 
gains and losses related to the hedging contracts to buy euros forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet  at july  compared to july   the value of the canadian dollar and the value of the euro increased by approximately and  respectively  compared to the value of the united states dollar 
the total of these currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  during fiscal  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
inflation inflation has not significantly impacted our operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales excluding certain sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging and a portion of endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized 
with respect to endoscopy and surgical  water purification and filtration  scientific products and dental products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of our water purification and filtration equipment and an insignificant amount of our sales of dialysis equipment and scientific products  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical  water purification and filtration and scientific product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical sales  we enter into arrangements whereby revenue is immediately recognized upon the transfer of equipment to customers who pay on a cost per procedure basis  subject to minimum monthly payments 
such arrangements are non cancelable by the customer and provide for a bargain purchase option by the customer at the conclusion of the term 
all direct costs related to these transactions are recorded at the time of revenue recognition 
some of such transactions also provide for future servicing of the equipment  which service revenue component is deferred and recognized over the period that such services are provided 
with respect to these multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to the equipment and service components based upon vendor specific objective evidence which principally includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and service sold as stand alone components 
sales of a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment to a third party distributor in the united states are recognized on a bill and hold basis as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
such sales satisfy each of the following criteria i the risks of ownership have passed to the third party distributor  ii the third party distributor must provide a written purchase order committing to the purchase of specified units  iii the bill and hold arrangement was specifically requested by the third party distributor for the purpose of minimizing the impact of multiple shipments of the units  iv the third party distributor provides specific instructions for shipment to customers  and completed units held by us for the third party distributor generally do not exceed three months of anticipated shipments  v we have no further performance obligations with respect to such units  vi completed units are invoiced to the third party distributor with day payment terms and such receivables are generally satisfied within such terms  and vii completed units are ready for shipment and segregated in a designated section of our warehouse reserved only for the third party distributor 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales  including the bill and hold sales arrangement  contain right of return provisions  and customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our sales of dialysis and dental products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and dental customers  volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided  such volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect a significant increase in volume rebates in the future related to the addition of dental products 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume and trade ins for the entire rebate agreement periods 
the decrease in rebates for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to not renewing one of our volume rebate agreements for our endoscope reprocessing products 
trade in allowances were not significant during fiscal if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic products  endoscope reprocessing products and services  and dental products are sold to third party distributors  the majority of endoscopy and surgical products and services are sold directly to hospitals  the majority of water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  scientific products and services are sold to hospitals  laboratories and other end users  and specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required as was the case in fiscal 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
in one such evaluation in fiscal  we determined that certain parts relating to our endoscope reprocessing equipment were obsolete  primarily due to design changes  resulting in an additional provision of approximately  with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including technology  customer relationships  patents and non compete agreements  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results which management believes to be reasonable 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
in one such review in july  our results of operation were adversely impacted by a  impairment charge  which was recorded in general and administrative expenses  primarily related to the cancellation of a computer system installation due to the termination of carsen s olympus distribution business on july  in addition  impairment charges of  and  were recorded during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  pertaining to the closing of two dialyzer reprocessing centers 
with few exceptions  our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimate 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty  although a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states may carry a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
in one such review during fiscal  our results of operations were adversely impacted by an additional charge of approximately  related to endoscope reprocessing equipment due to a component failure which required warranty service to many endoscope reprocessing units in the field 
management believes this situation was fully remedied in fiscal costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition  and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
although we have historically recorded minimal charges associated with exit or disposal activities  we believe that certain exit costs  including severance  will be incurred in the future related to the expiration of carsen s olympus agreements 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
we record legal fees and other expenses related to litigation as incurred 
additionally  we assess  in consultation with our counsel  the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
amounts are accrued when we  in consultation with counsel  determine that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
such a review considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the united states effective tax rate were to change in the future  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
it is our policy to establish reserves for exposures as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
we establish the reserves based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies and permanent tax differences 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves 
the majority of our income tax reserves originated from acquisitions  therefore  changes to such reserves  if any  would be adjusted through goodwill 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products are imported from the far east and western europe 
minntech and crosstex both sell a portion of their products outside of the united states and minntech s netherlands subsidiary sells a portion of its products outside of the european union 
consequently  our business could be materially affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting the united states  canada and the netherlands 
carsen imports a substantial portion of its products from the united states and pays for such products in united states dollars 
additionally  a portion of biolab s and saf t pak s inventories are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries carsen  biolab and saf t pak could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an overall positive impact in fiscal compared with fiscal  and in fiscal compared with fiscal  upon our results of operations and stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
in order to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on the purchases of inventories  carsen enters into foreign currency forward contracts on firm purchases of such inventories in united states dollars 
these foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedge instruments 
total commitments for such foreign currency forward contracts amounted to  united states dollars at july   at july  and cover a substantial portion of carsen s projected purchases of inventories through july changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
additionally  financial statements of the netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the european union and the united states had an overall adverse impact for fiscal compared with fiscal  and in fiscal compared with fiscal  upon our results of operations  and had a positive impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts have been designated as fair value hedge instruments 
there was one such foreign currency forward contract amounting to  at july   at july  which covers certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars 
such contract expired on august  under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting most of the adverse impact of the strengthening of the euro on our results of operations 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
interest rate market risk we have two credit facilities for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
therefore  interest expense is principally affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states and canada 
during fiscal  all of our outstanding borrowings were under our united states credit facilities 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our united states credit facilities  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally for libor contracts 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under our united states credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
our other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
we also maintained a significant cash balance of  at july  which is invested in low risk cash equivalents at prevailing market rates of interest 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income for us which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
on august   we financed the cash portion of the purchase price paid for crosstex through the us credit facilities 
as a result  outstanding debt under our us credit facilities was  at september  if such amount was outstanding throughout fiscal  interest expense would have been approximately  and a basis point increase in average libor would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  presently  we do not utilize any interest rate derivatives 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar and the euro as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
in order to minimize the potential adverse impact of unfavorable movements in these two foreign currencies  we utilize foreign currency forward contracts 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products from united states suppliers and is therefore exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar depreciates relative to the united states dollar 
a decline in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar could result in an unrealized loss of approximately  at july  based upon the level of commitments for foreign currency forward contracts on such purchases of inventories compared with approximately  at july  the increase in such exposure is reflective of our desire to increase our portfolio of such foreign exchange forward contracts due to an improvement in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar during fiscal minntech s netherlands subsidiary has net assets in currencies principally united states dollars other than its functional euro currency which must be converted into its functional euro currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  the netherlands subsidiary is exposed to risk if the value of the euro appreciates relative to the united states dollar 
a increase in the euro relative to the united states dollar could result in a realized loss of approximately  at july  based upon the level of commitments for foreign currency forward contracts compared with approximately  at july  however  since the netherlands subsidiary limits the use of foreign currency forward contracts to the hedging of actual net assets  this loss in fair value for such instruments generally would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of the underlying net assets 
based upon the level of all foreign currency forward contracts and assuming a adverse movement in foreign currencies  our overall exposure at july  and was approximately  and  respectively  which would be partially offset by gains in the values of the underlying hedged net assets of the netherlands subsidiary 
if our canadian subsidiary did not utilize foreign currency forward contracts  based upon estimated annual purchasing levels  a adverse movement in the canadian dollar exchange rate could result in future annual incremental cost of sales of approximately  in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements adverse changes would be caused by depreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar assuming that such operations are profitable 
for fiscal and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries 
furthermore  a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in an unrealized loss of  and  at july  and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such a loss to be realized in the near term
