you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
outstanding accomplishments in for both our css and cms were overshadowed by one very significant occurrence the gooseberry project 
as reported in  the losses on this highway project in south central utah had already resulted in the worst single project loss in our history 
unfortunately and unexpectedly  the losses continued to grow in as we battled inclement weather  changed conditions and last minute changes to the contract demanded by the owner 
the total estimated loss at completion which has been fully recognized as of december  on the gooseberry project is approximately million  resulting in an additional loss of approximately million in the gooseberry project is within weeks of completion once our workforce returns to the project 
we expect to resume work in earnest in the end of june  which is when we anticipate the weather and ground conditions will be acceptable for the completion of the project 
some of our accomplishments this year include our ability in our construction materials segment to continue an aggressive growth plan without sacrificing profitability 
to continue that growth plan we have secured a site in southwest las vegas to expand our cms footprint in that market 
we have acquired the parcel of land on which our cms southeast phoenix operation resides  thereby securing  for the long term  our facility location in that market 
our construction services 
table of contents segment recognized a recovery of costs of approximately million  previously recognized as a loss  on the million settlement of three claims with new mexico 
our css also improved its overall profitability of new work  but was overshadowed by the losses on the gooseberry project 
we made notable progress in resolving the remainder of our outstanding claims 
settling three of the five new mexico claims was a positive milestone 
in the clark county claim  the arbitration panel concluded its hearing and ruled against us and our subcontractor on one of the claims regarding the use of a shoring methodology  but ruled in our favor on that part of the claim pertaining to excess costs and delays associated with quality assurance and quality control testing  we refer to as qa qc 
meadow valley s portion of the denied claim was approximately million  while the panel awarded us approximately million for our portion of the qa qc claim we valued at approximately million 
the balance of the approximate million arbitration award goes to one of our subcontractors 
both meadow valley and clark county have appealed the panel s decisions and no payment has been made  nor is expected to be made  until after the appeals are adjudicated 
the remaining two new mexico claims have a calendared court date for august we anticipate that this court date will be delayed due to an extension of the discovery process 
we believe much of the cost overruns on the gooseberry project are compensable and we will be tabulating our costs once the project is complete and finalized 
to date we have not booked any claim proceeds that we may receive in the future from claims on the gooseberry project 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
revenue improved to million for the year ended december   as further referred to as  from million for the year ended december   as further referred to as the improved revenue resulted from a million increase  net of inter company sales  from the cms  offset by a decrease in revenue from the css of million 
the cms revenue increase was due primarily to an approximate volume increase in from  the average unit sales price increased approximately in from backlog in the css increased to million compared to million a year ago 
css revenue was impacted less by the amount of the beginning backlog than by the progress schedules and nature of the contracts contained in the backlog at the beginning of revenue in the css was also affected by the gooseberry project 
because so much of our business stems from competitively bid public works  backlog will fluctuate depending upon the amount and type of contracts that we bid on and win 
bid bonds provided by our surety company are required on most of the contracts that we bid  therefore  any restrictions or limitations in the extension of surety credit can impact the amount and type of contracts available to be bid by our css 
surety credit limits and conditions may improve as our financial performance improves  but there can be no assurance that surety credit will be increased 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit increased to million for from million for and consolidated gross margin  as a percent of revenue  increased to in from in gross profit from css decreased to 
million in from million in and the gross profit margin decreased to 
from in the respective periods 
the decrease in the css gross profit margin was greatly affected by the gooseberry project 
in  we recognized an additional loss on the gooseberry project in the amount of million bringing the total anticipated loss at completion of the project to approximately million 
we believe  but can not assure  that there will not be any additional future losses 
this project is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of gross profit margins are affected by a 
table of contents variety of factors including  the quality and accuracy of the initial estimate  construction delays and difficulties due to weather or other conditions  availability of materials  the timing of work performed by other subcontractors and the physical and geological condition of the construction site 
gross profit from the cms increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin increased to from in the respective periods 
the increase in the gross profit margin in the cms during results from an increase of in the average unit price and an increase in our unit volume of sales 
the increase in the average unit sales price reflects our ability to pass on additional costs to our customers  such as the increased costs of raw materials and transportation of those materials 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at million for when compared to although the total general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged payroll  bonuses and related payroll tax expenses increased by 
million  offset by a 
million decrease in bad debt expense 
interest income  expense and other income 
interest income remained relatively flat at 
million for compared to interest expense for decreased to 
million from 
million for as a result of the reduction of our non equipment related debt 
interest expense directly related to equipment is expensed as a cost of the equipment and is included in the cost of revenue 
other income for remained flat at 
million compared to other income for consisted of gains on the disposal of property  equipment and land 
we do not anticipate other income to be as significant in net income 
net income was 
million for as compared to a net income of 
million for the increase in net income was the result of the improved gross profit  as discussed above  complemented by other income and offset by losses on the gooseberry project 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
revenue improved to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  
the improved revenue resulted from a million increase  net of inter company sales  from the cms  offset by a decrease in revenue from the css of million

gross profit from the cms increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin decreased to from in the respective periods 
the decrease in the gross profit margin in the cms during is the result of only a slight increase of  in the average unit price  which was not sufficient to compensate for the increase in the unit cost 
the inability to raise prices while experiencing increased costs was the result of price competition in a challenging economic environment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease resulted primarily from a 
million decrease in legal fees  offset by a 
million increase in the voluntary match contribution to the k plan 
interest income  expense and other income 
interest income for decreased to 
million from 
million for resulting primarily from a decrease in invested cash reserves 
interest expense remained relatively flat for at 
million compared to

net income was 
million for as compared to a net income of 
million for the decrease in net income was the result of the reduction in gross profit  as discussed above  offset by a net increase in other income expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary need for capital continues to be the expansion of the cms 
as we expand our business we will continue to utilize the availability of capital offered by financial institutions  in turn increasing our total debt and debt service obligations 
we are also seeking to bring our construction material segment public  in an effort to raise additional capital for that segment s expansion efforts 
we are continuing our investigation into alternative sites in the southwest phoenix metropolitan area to eventually locate a third ready mix facility 
we broke ground on a ready mix production facility  as part of our expansion plan in the southwest las vegas metropolitan area in december historically  our primary source of cash has been from operations and financial institutions 
we believe our historical sources of capital will be satisfactory to meet our needs for the coming year 
per the terms of our line of credit agreement in  we elected to allow our fully drawn line of credit to convert into a term agreement 
the interest rate has remained at chase manhattan bank s prime  plus requiring equal monthly principal payments of  plus interest through december  the term agreement is collateralized by all of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to maintain a certain level of tangible net worth as well as maintain a ratio of total debt to tangible net worth 
at december  we were in compliance with the covenants 
we continue to investigate new credit arrangements  which we expect will provide us with an available line of credit 
we feel that our cash reserves and cash inflow from operations will provide sufficient liquidity until a line of credit agreement is in place

impact of inflation there have been increases in the cost of our raw materials and the transport of those materials  however  we have been able to effectively pass these additional costs on to our customers 
therefore  we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
however  additional substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect our operations in future periods 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are the revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use a percentage of completion accounting method  our allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the revenue recognition and cost estimation accounting method is applied by the css to heavy construction projects executed under multi year contracts with various customers 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting during  and  respectively 
revenues and costs from fixed price and modified fixed price construction contracts are recognized for each contract on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the estimated total of direct costs 
direct costs include  among other things  direct labor  field labor  equipment rent  subcontracting  direct materials  and direct overhead 
general and administrative expenses are accounted for as period costs and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of the estimates to complete construction contracts in progress 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which such losses are determined  without reference to the percentage of completion 
as contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions in costs and earnings estimated during the course of the work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts that required such revisions become known 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affects the amounts reported in our financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimated future material prices and customer specification changes 
if our business conditions were 
table of contents different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this accounting policy  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements 
we are also required to estimate the collectibility of our account receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and the related aging of the past due balances 
our provision for bad debts during the years ended december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
we determine our reserve by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories and percentages of certain types of revenue generated  as well as a review of the individual accounts outstanding 
we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand requirements and compare these with the current inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions and longer than expected usage periods 
at december  and  inventories of  and  respectively  are net of reserves of  and  respectively 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions or market activity 
summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized as follows payments due by period less than after dollars in thousands total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory costs 
sfas amends the guidance in apb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  management has not yet determined the effects of adopting this statement on the company s financial position or results of operations

sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  management has not yet determined the effects of adopting this statement on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payment 
the sfas r revision established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees 
for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  the revisions to sfas are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  management intends to comply with the standard upon its effectiveness  however  we do not believe that the impact would be materially different from the pro forma disclosure under sfas n see note summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements item for disclosure information regarding stock option expense 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies our cms has shown steady growth since its inception and we plan to continue to exploit opportunities within that segment of our business 
the proposed public offering for a portion of rmi is to raise capital for such purposes 
the key dynamics of employment and population growth within our geographic markets appear to present the cms with continued growth opportunities 
furthermore  during the past approximately eighteen months  occasional shortages of cement  a key raw material used in the production of ready mix concrete  have created both challenges and opportunities while costs have increased  the market environment has permitted us to pass those costs on to the end user rather than absorb them 
it appears that demand for construction materials will remain steady and that the supply of raw materials will remain relatively short  thereby likely maintaining stable prices  or  if costs rise  a possibility of further price increases 
our plan to vacate the construction services market of new mexico  terminate our full time presence in utah and extricate ourselves from the burdens  in both cost and time  of trailing claims  has taken us a number of years and is not yet entirely complete 
during that process  the performance of our css has been well below its historical norms  and in particular  has been further exacerbated by the losses on the gooseberry project in and we believe we have taken a conservative approach in booking the losses on the gooseberry project to the extent that it is not expected to have any degrading affect on our performance in if true  the css improvements  heretofore overshadowed by the gooseberry losses  will become more visible and are expected to be much improved 
if the css can demonstrate operating improvements  then as profitability  working capital and liquidity increase  so too will surety credit likely increase  thereby allowing us to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
bidding opportunities within our focused market areas of nevada and arizona are ample for the size of our current surety program and it is reasonable to believe  given historical bidding success  that backlog may increase slightly during as public works constitute the majority of our css volume  and government is the primary source of funding for infrastructure work  it is  therefore  important that funding be maintained 
the national transportation legislation  tea  expired in september interim funding extensions have been granted while congress continues to work on a new six year highway bill 
it is expected  but cannot be assured  that new legislation will be enacted during to fund another six year transportation infrastructure program 
over the next few months until funding authority is finalized  state departments of transportation may not let as many contracts until they are fully aware of the funding available to them 
the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract awards 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects and construction manager at risk projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
in light of the rising needs for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current needs to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally 
table of contents mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also a trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by it could dramatically affect the nature of our markets 
in november  voters in maricopa county phoenix  arizona metropolitan area passed a measure to extend  for another twenty years  an existing half cent sales tax dedicated to the construction and maintenance of transportation facilities  including freeways  streets and mass transit 
it is expected that this measure will generate approximately billion of funding over the twenty year period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not have foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we temporarily invest our excess cash and restricted cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
we monitor risk exposure to monies invested in securities in our financial institutions 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations 
we manage our exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in the fair value of our debt obligations would have been approximately  at december  see note notes payable and note line of credit item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
