despite the termination in the third quarter of of two programs with one of our telecommunication clients  which contributed million in revenue for the year ended december   we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to telecommunications and dsl clients will remain fairly constant during due mainly to increased volumes but lower margins as compared to from our dsl modem business  which is still in a strong growth mode 
the telephone and caller id equipment business is mature  yet steady 
retail  catalog and direct marketing

our client contracts do not guarantee volumes 
despite the end of the tactica international  inc business  which represented of total revenues for the year ended december  and the end of the martha stewart living omnimedia business in march  which represented of total revenues for the year ended december   we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to our retail and catalog clients will remain fairly consistent during due to the anticipated additions of new channels  product lines and divisions for existing clients  along with internal growth and a strengthening of the overall economy 
revenues attributable to our direct marketing clients increased in the first half of due to a highly successful new product introduced by one of our newer direct marketing clients  but weakened considerably in the second half as that product matured and the client s advertising for that product was reduced 
the direct marketing vertical was weak throughout all of on october   tactica international  inc tactica  one of the company s direct response clients  filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter in us bankruptcy court 
on october  the bankruptcy court approved  on an interim basis  a stipulation and consent order stipulation entered into between tactica and innotrac  whereby tactica has acknowledged the validity of innotrac s claim and innotrac s first priority security interest in and warehouseman s lien on tactica s inventory held by innotrac 
this stipulation allowed tactica to continue to sell its inventory while reducing the receivables owed by tactica to innotrac 
the stipulation required that the proceeds from the sale of such inventory be split with innotrac on the first million in customer orders and thereafter upon receipt of tactica customer payments 
additionally  tactica was required to prepay innotrac for any services prior to its inventory being shipped 
tactica defaulted on the stipulation and on january   innotrac issued a notice of default to tactica 
in march  innotrac and tactica reached a verbal agreement that would permit innotrac to liquidate the tactica inventory in order to pay down the receivable balance  with any excess proceeds to be remitted to tactica 
innotrac is currently negotiating with the creditor s committee on the terms of the liquidation and an additional amount of proceeds to be remitted to unsecured creditors 
for the year ended december   this client represented of total revenues 
as of march   tactica owed  in principal to innotrac for past fulfillment and call center services 
the company has recorded a reserve associated with this receivable 
based on the stipulation and an appraisal performed by a third party independent appraiser  the reserve was decreased from million at june  to million at september  the reserve was further reduced to million at december  based on the agreement reached with tactica regarding the liquidation of their inventory

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
goodwill represents the cost of an acquired enterprise in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   which changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
innotrac s goodwill carrying amount as of december  and was million 
this asset relates to the goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of universal distribution services uds in december including the earnout payment made to the former uds shareholders in february  and the acquisition of ifulfillment  inc in july in accordance with sfas no 
 the company contracted with an independent third party valuation firm to perform a valuation in the first quarter of the third party valuation supported that the fair value of the reporting unit at january  exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets  including goodwill  and thus no impairment currently exists 
management has reviewed and concurs with the major assumptions used in the third party s valuation at january  the company will perform this impairment test annually as of january or sooner if circumstances dictate 
accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s net deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of million recorded in and the net losses generated in and innotrac has a tax net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years  create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectively 
income taxes associated with future earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax provision of  was offset by a corresponding reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when  and if  the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance can be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the revised statement clarifies and expands sfas no 
s guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability  and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
the revised statement supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
under the provisions of sfas r  the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas no 
 as originally issued  is eliminated  and entities are required to measure liabilities incurred to employees in share based payment transactions at fair value 
the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation plans under apb since the exercise price for all options granted under those plans was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  no compensation cost is recognized 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r the company is permitted to continue the application of apb until the reporting period ended june   at which time the company will adopt the provisions of fas no 
r and expense the unvested awards issued
