item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  predicts  expects  estimates  intends  will  continue  may  potential  should and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including  among others  those discussed in this section as well as under item business and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the risks detailed from time to time in the company s future sec reports 
we are a leading supplier of high performance bioanalytical measurement systems that accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
our systems and consumables enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics  proteomics and parallel chemistry by facilitating the high throughput and cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
our solutions are based on our advanced core technologies that integrate our expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology  and chemistry 
we enable our customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness  which ultimately accelerates the complex process of discovering and developing new drugs 
our customers include leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
the success of our business is impacted by research and development spending trends of these customers  which has been unpredictable over the last three years and remains unpredictable in the near term 
we focus on generating revenue growth through the development of innovative products for these customers 
in each of the last four years  our internal research and development efforts have enabled us to exceed our goal of generating over of annual revenues from products that are introduced in the last three years 
we divide our revenues into two product families based primarily on the customers to which they are sold 
the drug discovery product family includes systems that integrate detection  liquid handling and automation  have price points in excess of  and are primarily sold to large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
product lines included in the drug discovery family are flipr  analyst  ionworks  patchxpress  imagexpress and discovery systems 
the life sciences product family  which includes bench top detection  imaging software and liquid handling products  consists of the spectramax  metamorph  genepix  threshold  skatron and axopatch product lines 
these single purpose instruments generally cost less than  and are sold throughout our entire customer base 
we recognize revenue on the sale of these products  when collectibility is reasonably assured  at the time of shipment and transfer of title to customers and distributors 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
we are deriving an increasing portion of our revenues from overseas operations 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of total revenues in  and in and we currently have sales and services offices in the united kingdom  germany  japan  and south korea 
in addition  we employ sales and service personnel in france  the benelux  scandinavia  spain  australia and china 
additional international sales are conducted through distributors around the world 
we anticipate that international sales will account for an increasing percentage of revenues in the future  and we expect to continue expanding our international operations in order to take advantage of increasing international market opportunities 
our international business exposes us to a number of risks  including political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  the impact of business cycles and downturns in economies outside of the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to export our products or sell into particular jurisdictions  import and export license requirements and restrictions  
table of contents molecular devices difficulties and costs of staffing  managing and monitoring geographically disparate operations  difficulties in maintaining effective communications with employees and customers due to distance  language and cultural barriers  disruptions in international transport or delivery  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights  particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the united states  difficulties in enforcing agreements through non us legal systems  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting receivables  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of axon instruments  inc axon 
this acquisition expands our product portfolio with systems for cellular neurosciences and genomics and combines complementary product lines in high throughput imaging and electrophysiology 
this acquisition did not cause us to create a new business segment 
the total cost of the acquisition was million including cash and stock paid  options assumed  and direct transaction costs 
as a result of the acquisition  we received million in cash that had been on the balance sheet of axon 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of axon have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we allocated the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a valuation of the purchased intangible assets was undertaken by a third party valuation specialist to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of each identifiable asset and in allocating the purchase price among acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to acquired in process research and development projects 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative use 
standard valuation procedures and techniques were utilized in determining the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
to determine the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development  we considered  among other factors  the stage of development of each project  the time and resources needed to complete each project  and expected income and associated risks 
associated risks included the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and the risks related to the viability of and potential changes to future target markets 
the analysis resulted in million of the purchase price being allocated to acquired in process research and development and charged to earnings  using discount rates ranging from to 
the in process research and development acquired from axon consists of projects related to the patchxpress and imagexpress product development initiatives 
we estimated that the in process projects related to each of these products varied from to complete  based on research and development complexity  costs and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
the value assigned to acquired in process research and development was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the acquired in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by axon and its competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on axon s weighted average cost of capital 
the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  the percentage of completion of each project  anticipated market acceptance and penetration  and market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 

table of contents molecular devices critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we apply the provisions of the following authoritative literature in the development of our revenue recognition policies emerging issues task force eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements and there are no rights of return or additional performance guarantees by us 
statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements as determined by means of our quoting process and published price lists 
staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab 
revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of instruments to end users with a one year warranty 
these arrangements include a single element the instrument 
other single element arrangements include the sale of consumables  software  service  installation or training 
arrangements incorporating multiple elements may exist  either through one invoice or through separate invoices entered into with a single customer at or near the same time 
these multiple element arrangements can include any combination of the previously described products or services 
all single element and multiple element arrangements are evidenced by an invoice in response to a written purchase order 
each element of an arrangement is invoiced at fair value as determined by means of our quoting process and published price lists 
standard end user terms include risk of loss transferring to the purchaser at the time of shipment  net day payment terms  no right of return or exchange  no right to upgrades and no acceptance provisions 
we do not enter into arrangements that require performance in excess of our published specifications 
warranty future warranty costs are estimated based on historical experience and provided for at the time of sale 
accounts receivable we sell our products primarily to corporations  academic institutions  government entities and distributors within the drug discovery and life sciences research markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we provide reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions in the customers country or industry  historical losses and customer credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against the reserve 
estimated losses have historically been within our expectations 

table of contents molecular devices inventories inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
such write downs have historically been within our expectations 
goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded value of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of december   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million  and million  respectively 
the determination of the value of such assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests annually and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has occurred 
we assess potential impairments to other intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our business  market condition and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all of a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
equity investments we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in intangible and other assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than percent of voting securities and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
when our ownership exceeds percent of voting securities but is less than percent  or we have the ability to exercise significant influence  the investment is accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  the investee s proportionate share of net income or loss and amortization of the investee s net excess investment over its equity in net assets is included in net income or loss 
as of december   we did not hold any investments accounted for under the equity method 
we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the fair values 
we monitor the preceding factors to identify events or circumstances that would cause us to test for other than temporary impairment and revise our assumptions for the estimated recovery of equity investments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized in the future 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future taxable income 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
we will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances periodically 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects upon our effective tax rate in the future 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  future levels of capital expenditures  international operations and our success in research and development and commercializing products

there was no similar write off in restructuring charge 
in conjunction with the acquisition of axon  we implemented an integration plan which included the termination of axon and molecular devices employees  the relocation or transfer to other sites of employees and the closure of duplicate facilities 
termination costs related to molecular devices employees totaled million and have been expensed as a restructuring charge 
there were no similar restructuring charges in 
table of contents molecular devices gain on sale of equity securities 
in october  serologicals corporation serologicals purchased upstate group  inc upstate  a privately held company in which we held an equity interest 
as a result of the acquisition  we received cash and shares of common stock in serologicals 
subsequently  we disposed of our entire equity interest in serologicals 
the net gain as a result of these transactions was million  which is reported as gain on sale of equity securities in the consolidated statements of income 
there was no similar gain in interest expense 
we incurred  in interest expense on our revolving credit facility entered into to finance our acquisition of axon

the effective tax rates for and are calculated on profit before tax 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments compared to million and million as of december  and december   respectively 

table of contents molecular devices on july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of axon 
in connection with the acquisition of axon  we entered into a new senior unsecured credit facility with union bank of california  na  which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to million 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
all loans outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate plus or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the revolving credit facility may be drawn  paid and reborrowed at our option  and matures on july  we initially used million of this credit facility to partially finance the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to axon shareholders and certain optionholders 
the million drawdown was repaid and the revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the cash provided during was primarily the result of net income of million plus net non cash charges of million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the non cash charges included depreciation and amortization of million  a million charge for acquired in process research and development  million of decreases in deferred tax assets  and million of tax benefits realized as a result of employee stock option exercises  offset by million from the sale of equity securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase between and was primarily due to million used to acquire axon  net of cash received 
offsetting this cash used by investing activities  we received million upon the sale of investments and received million from the sale of our equity investment in upstate 
additional cash used in investing activities included the purchase of property and equipment for million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase between and was due to million spent to repurchase  shares of our common stock  offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock for options exercised and employee stock purchases 
the share repurchases occurred throughout  and accounted for approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  approximately  shares remained available for repurchase at december  under the stock repurchase program initially approved by our board of directors in august in february  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million under our stock repurchase program 
on february   our board of directors again determined to continue the stock repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
we believe that our existing cash and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate our anticipated cash flow from operations is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under item business including  in particular  variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products and collect accounts receivable  the timing of customer orders  competition  risks associated with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  supplier or manufacturing problems or delays  and risks associated with past and potential future acquisitions 
likewise  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on our current plans which may change and assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development  the number and scope of our research and development programs  market acceptance and demand for our products  the costs that may be involved in enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
table of contents molecular devices potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities  the costs associated with repurchasing shares of our common stock  manufacturing capacity requirements  and the costs of expanding our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities both in the united states and abroad 
we have generated sufficient cash flow to fund our capital requirements primarily through operating and financing activities over the last three years 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing in the future to support our existing operations or potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities that may arise 
therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all  and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations our facilities are leased under noncancelable operating leases 
in addition  we have contractual commitments for the purchase of products  components and services ending in as of december   the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in millions payments due by period to to and total thereafter operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations recent accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion 
fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt fas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under fas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by fas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
although expected to be material  we cannot predict the impact of adoption of fas r at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have 
table of contents molecular devices approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and in  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial investments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
foreign currency exchange we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  germany  france  the benelux  canada  japan and south korea  where we sell our products directly in local currencies 
all other foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically been immaterial 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign sales for the fiscal year  indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  norway  switzerland  japan  south korea and australia are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest and investment income our interest and investment income is subject to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with united states banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within days to two years  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at december  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending upon actual balances and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements 
debt and interest expense in connection with the acquisition of axon  we entered into a new senior unsecured credit facility with union bank of california  na  which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to million 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
all loans outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate plus or libor plus 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our debt balance at december   indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as there was no balance outstanding at year end 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on the level of our outstanding debt and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements
