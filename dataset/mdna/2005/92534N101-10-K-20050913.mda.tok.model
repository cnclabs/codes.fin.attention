these non gaap measures are used by management and the company s investors to understand the liquidity trends of the company s marketing margins related to current period operations which are reflected within the operating cash flow section of the cash flow statement 
gaap revenues and marketing expenses are important measures used to understand the marketing margins earned during the period in the income statement 
however  in order to understand the company s operating cash flow  it is important to understand the primary current period drivers of that cash flow 
two of the primary indicators of operating liquidity for the period are revenues before deferral and marketing costs before deferral 
revenues before deferral are revenues before application of sab and represent the revenues billed during the current reporting period less an allowance for membership cancellations 
that is  revenues before deferral for a reporting period include membership fees received in the current reporting period that will be recorded as gaap revenues in future reporting periods and exclude membership fees received in prior reporting periods that are recorded as gaap revenues in the current reporting period 
marketing costs before deferral are marketing costs before the application of sab and sop and represent marketing costs paid or accrued during the current reporting period 
that is  marketing costs before deferral for a reporting period include costs paid or accrued in the current reporting period that will be recorded as gaap marketing expenses in future reporting periods and exclude marketing expenses paid or accrued in prior reporting periods that are recorded as gaap marketing expenses in the current reporting period 
neither revenues before deferral nor marketing costs before deferral exclude charges or liabilities that will require cash settlement 
additionally  these measures are not a substitute for or superior to revenues and marketing expenses determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in light of the difference between revenues before deferral  marketing costs before deferral and their most directly comparable gaap measures  the company uses these measures solely as liquidity measures and not as performance measures 
revenues before deferral for the years ended june   and are calculated as follows in millions revenues change in deferred revenues revenues before deferral marketing costs before deferral for the years ended june   and are calculated as follows in millions marketing expenses change in deferred marketing costs marketing costs before deferral the company s management and investors use ebitda and adjusted ebitda  among other measures  to evaluate the year over year performance of its businesses  to measure that performance compared with internal budgets and to determine compensation under its management incentive plans 
ebitda eliminates the effects of interest and other expense  income taxes  noncash depreciation of tangible assets and noncash amortization of intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic cost of certain capitalized tangible assets and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company s businesses nor does it reflect the effect of interest and taxes 
the company s management evaluates these costs through other financial measures 
adjusted ebitda is calculated using revenues before deferral and marketing costs before deferral instead of gaap revenues and gaap marketing expenses 
adjusted ebitda is useful to management because it eliminates the amortization related to the recognition of gaap revenues and gaap marketing expenses and therefore includes only membership fees received in the current reporting period and marketing costs paid or accrued in the current reporting period 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  operating income  net income  operating cash flows or other measures of financial performance and liquidity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the following tables reconcile ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income for the years ended june in millions for the year ended june  consolidated marketing corporate and total services personals other net income interest and other expense  net provision for income taxes operating income expense depreciation and amortization ebitda change in deferred revenues change in deferred marketing costs adjusted ebitda for the year ended june  consolidated marketing corporate and total services personals other net income interest and other expense  net provision for income taxes operating income expense depreciation and amortization ebitda change in deferred revenues change in deferred marketing costs adjusted ebitda for the year ended june  consolidated marketing corporate and total services personals other net income interest and other expense  net provision for income taxes operating income expense depreciation and amortization ebitda change in deferred revenues change in deferred marketing costs adjusted ebitda management does not allocate interest and other expense  net nor does it allocate provision for income taxes to the individual segments

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry in which the company operates and management s beliefs and assumptions 
these forward looking statements include statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as believe  expect  estimate  project  continue or anticipate 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on many assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that may change 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements
