item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary during fiscal  revenues increased from fiscal primarily due to continued increases in our customer support revenues  as well as favorable foreign exchange rate impacts resulting from the translation of our international revenues into us dollars 
revenue increased percent for services customer support  consulting and education and declined percent for licenses 
europe  middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac reported revenue growth  whereas  the americas us  canada  mexico and latin america revenues declined 
most expenses increased in absolute dollars  but remained fairly consistent year over year as a percentage of revenues 
additionally  our international revenues and profitability benefited from foreign currencies strengthening against the us dollar 
in fiscal  changes in exchange rates resulted in increased revenues of million and increased expenses of million when compared with international results translated at a constant exchange rate 
during fiscal  revenues increased from fiscal primarily due to a slight increase in technology spending  new product introductions  continued increases in our customer support revenues  as well as favorable foreign exchange rate impacts on our international operations 
revenue increased for both licenses and services 
additionally  each geographical region also reported revenue growth 
the benefit of our fiscal cost containment measures continued to be reflected during the year  resulting in increased net income from fiscal our international operations benefited from foreign currencies strengthening against the us dollar 
in fiscal  changes in exchange rates resulted in increased revenues of million and increased expenses of million compared with international results when translated at a constant exchange rate period over period 
as discussed below in the results of operations section  we have seen a generally increasing trend toward multi million dollar licensing arrangements since fiscal seasonality 
our first fiscal quarter license revenues are typically lower than license revenues in the immediately preceding fourth fiscal quarter because our commission plans and other sales incentives are structured for annual performance and contain bonus provisions based on annual quotas that typically are triggered in the later quarters in a year 
in addition  many of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january and it is common for capital expenditures to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first fiscal quarter results will continue

revenues in thousands fiscal year ended january  percentage change fiscal vs 
fiscal percentage change fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenues our revenues are derived from fees for software licenses and services 
services revenues are comprised of customer support  education and consulting 
total revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal was percent  which was comprised of a percent increase in services offset by a percent decrease in licenses 
the increase in services was primarily due to customer support revenues 
revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal was percent  of which percentage points were generated by growth in our customer support revenues with the remainder due to a small increase in license revenue 
management believes the continued growth in customer support revenues is due to the fact that our installed base of customers continues to grow annually with additional license sales and a significant portion of this cumulative installed base renewing their support contracts each year 
geographically  revenue contribution as a percentage of total revenue changed and international revenues international is defined as emea and apac exceeded americas revenues united states  canada  mexico and 
table of contents lain america in fiscal international contributed percent of the revenues in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal there was no significant change in the geographic revenue contribution from fiscal to fiscal the decline in worldwide macroeconomic conditions in the technology industry from through significantly impacted our results 
in addition to the sustained low levels of it spending  we believe the introduction of new products  level of acceptance of our products in the market and competition have also impacted our revenues 
in fiscal  total revenues when translated at a constant exchange rate from the same period in the prior year would have been approximately million  or a percent increase over the same period in fiscal in fiscal  total revenues when translated at a constant exchange rate from the same period in the prior year would have been approximately  million  or a percent increase over the same period in fiscal many factors that impact our growth are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that our revenues will grow in the future 
the following table sets forth the components of deferred revenues in thousands january license fees services total deferred revenues the deferred services revenues are predominantly comprised of deferred customer support revenues but also include deferred consulting and education revenues 
deferred customer support revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
deferred license fees and deferred consulting and education revenues generally are deferred due to revenue recognition requirements under us gaap 
management believes the fluctuation in deferred revenues tends to be seasonal due to the fact that a relatively higher proportion of customer support annual contract renewals occur in the fourth quarter 
deferred revenues increased annually for the periods ended january  and  almost exclusively because of increased deferred customer support revenue 
deferred revenues will fluctuate in the future as a function of the timing and terms of particular transactions and will not necessarily correlate with revenue growth in any given quarter and fluctuations in deferred revenues are not necessarily an indicator of future license revenue 
license fees in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal percentage change fiscal vs 
fiscal percentage change fiscal vs 
fiscal license fees management believes the decline in license revenues from fiscal to fiscal was related to the economic factors  it spending  level of acceptance of our product and competitive conditions  each of which was discussed above under total revenues 
management believes the challenging market conditions in the americas and the rate of market acceptance of weblogic platform impacted fiscal license revenues 
in addition  tuxedo revenues declined approximately percent or million when comparing fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  we had transactions with product revenues greater than million compared to transactions in fiscal there were no individual transactions with a license value greater than million during fiscal  but  we did have one large transaction with a license value greater than million during fiscal these factors were partially offset by positive changes in foreign exchange rates 
fiscal license fees when translated at a constant exchange rate from the same period in the prior year would have been million  or a decline of percent compared to fiscal 
table of contents management believes transactions greater than million constitute a significant portion of total license revenue and the inherent volatility related to the timing of the closing of such transactions increases the risk that reported results may differ from expected results 
management also believes the decline in tuxedo revenue may not necessarily be indicative of a future trend due to historical fluctuations of tuxedo revenue 
the slight increase in license revenues from fiscal to fiscal was due to a positive exchange rate impact and an increase in the number of transactions greater than million 
fiscal license revenues when translated at a constant exchange rate from the same period in the prior year would have been million  or a decrease of percent compared to fiscal the number of transactions with a license value greater than million increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal furthermore  we entered into one large transaction with a license value greater than million during fiscal there was no individual transaction with license value greater than million during fiscal service revenues the following table provides a summary of service revenues in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal percentage change fiscal vs

fiscal consulting and education revenues customer support revenues total service revenues consulting and education revenues consist of professional services related to the deployment and use of our software products 
these arrangements are generally structured on a time and materials basis and revenues are recognized as services are performed 
customer support revenues consist of fees for annual maintenance contracts typically priced as a percentage of the license fee and are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement generally one year 
total services revenues for fiscal and when translated at a constant exchange rate from the same period in the prior year would have been million and million  respectively  an increase of percent and percent increase over the prior fiscal year 
the significant increases in customer support revenues annually from fiscal to fiscal to fiscal was driven primarily by maintenance renewals on our existing installed base of software licenses as well as maintenance contracts sold together with new sales of software licenses 
the increase in consulting and education revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in consulting services performed in the americas and emea 
management believes the increase in consulting revenues from fiscal to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal was due to demand related to our new weblogic products  which were released in july in fiscal  this demand resulted in consulting billable headcount increasing due to additional employees as well as increased use of third party contractors to meet customer requirements 
in addition  we believe consulting revenues increased in fiscal due to improved productivity resulting from a change in our consulting business model which segregates the functions of selling and delivering consulting 

table of contents revenues by geographic region the following tables provide a summary of revenues by geographic region in thousands fiscal fiscal percentage of consolidated total revenues fiscal fiscal percentage of consolidated total revenues fiscal fiscal percentage of consolidated total revenues americas emea apac total revenues for each of the twelve fiscal quarters included in the three fiscal years ended january   international revenues as a percentage of total revenues have ranged between percent to percent for emea and percent to percent for apac 
these ranges are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future depending upon regional economic conditions  foreign currency exchange rates  and other factors 
in fiscal  the percentage of total revenue contribution from the americas and emea shifted slightly when compared to prior years 
the decline in the americas revenues was comprised of a percent decline in license revenue offset by a percent increase in services revenues 
management believes the decline in americas license revenue was due to challenging it market conditions  reduced contribution from large transactions  and the rate of market acceptance of weblogic platform the increase in americas service revenues was due to increases in customer support and consulting and education revenues of percent and percent  respectively 
our revenues in emea in fiscal and were favorably impacted by the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly the euro and the british pound 
in fiscal and fiscal  the increase in revenues due to strengthening foreign currencies in emea was million and million  respectively  when translated on a constant currency basis 
emea s revenues increased by million and million when comparing fiscal to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal the increase in total emea revenues from fiscal to fiscal was due to an increase in revenues for all lines of business in the services organization  offset by a slight decline in license revenues 
the increase in total emea revenues for fiscal to fiscal was due to growth in both the license and services business and was primarily due to strong performances in the north  south and nordic sub regions 
our revenues in apac in fiscal and were favorably impacted by the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly the yen 
in fiscal and fiscal  the increase in revenues due to strengthening foreign currencies in apac was million and million  respectively 
in constant currencies  apac experienced a decline of percent in total revenues comparing fiscal to fiscal and was virtually flat for fiscal to fiscal a significant contributor to the overall decline in apac revenue was a percent decline in license revenues  primarily attributable to declines in japan and the china region  offset by a percent increase in services revenues  which was fairly consistent across the apac region and primarily related to customer support revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues the following table provides a summary of cost of revenues in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal percentage change fiscal vs 
fiscal percentage change fiscal vs 
fiscal cost of license fees cost of services total cost of revenues cost of license fees 
cost of license fees  as referenced in the table above  includes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets including amortization of purchased technology  non compete agreements  customer base  patents  trademarks and distribution rights  direct costs and fees paid to third party contractors in connection with our customer license compliance program  royalties and license fees paid to third parties based on a per copy fee or a prepaid fee amortized straight line over the contractual period  and costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  the printing of user manuals  and packaging  distribution and localization costs 
cost of license fees were percent  percent and percent of license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in the cost of license fees as a percentage of license revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the million decline in charges associated with amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles declined due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in the first half of fiscal  slightly offset by additional amortization of intangible assets associated with a small acquisition in december and a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on our assessment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the impairment represents two small acquisitions where we are no longer utilizing the purchased technology that was acquired 
management believes that cost of license fees will increase slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal due to new royalty agreements that will begin amortizing in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in cost of licenses for fiscal to fiscal was due to million increase in expenses related to the expansion of our compliance program  a million increase in distribution costs and a million increase in third party royalties 
these increases were offset by a million decline in amortization charges related to acquired intangibles 
the increased activity in the compliance program has resulted in the detection of over deployments of our software and has resulted in additional license and support revenue opportunities 
the increase in distribution costs in fiscal was split approximately evenly between americas and international and management believes the increase correlates with the increase in license revenues and localization costs of new products released in july the decline in amortization of acquired intangibles was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during fiscal  partially offset by the increased amortization effect from a number of small acquisitions that took place in early fiscal amortization expense of million was recorded for fiscal associated with intangible assets recorded prior to january  and future amortization expense is currently expected to total approximately million and million for the fiscal years ending january  and  respectively 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods

sales headcount increased by nearly from fiscal to fiscal strengthening foreign currencies against the us dollar also contributed to percent increase in expenses

research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined to percent from percent and percent for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the decline is due to total revenues increasing at a faster rate than the research and development expenses have increased on an annual basis 
research and development expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to the 
table of contents following factors  a million increase in compensation expense due to annual merit increases and additional headcount of approximately employees in fiscal  a million increase related to site transition and consolidation expenses and a million increase related to retention and severance costs associated with redeploying resources from the us to international locations

general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal from fiscal due to increased legal expenses of approximately million principally focused on intellectual property matters as well as a million investment in our international operations 
these expenses were offset by a million decline in equipment expense related to it and a million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
there was also a foreign currency impact of approximately percent which increased expenses based on a constant currency calculation from fiscal compared to fiscal other charges facilities consolidation 
during fiscal  we approved a plan to consolidate certain facilities in regions including the united states  canada and germany 
a facilities consolidation charge of million was recorded 
table of contents using management s best estimates and was based upon the remaining future lease commitments and brokerage fees for vacant facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
in fiscal  an additional million was accrued due to a reassessment of original estimates of costs of abandoning the leased facilities compared to the actual results and future estimates 
during fiscal  due to a decline in employee and contractor hiring and headcount we identified the opportunity to reduce our facilities requirements 
we approved a plan to consolidate six sites in the united states and canada 
a facilities consolidation charge of million was recorded and was comprised of million related to future lease commitments and million of leasehold improvement write offs 
the million of future lease commitments was calculated based on management s estimates and the present value of the remaining future lease commitments for vacant facilities  net of present value of the estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of abandoning the leased facilities identified above  including estimated costs to sublease  were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate industry sources 
as of january   million of lease termination costs  net of anticipated sublease income  remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by fiscal as of january   million is classified as short term and the remaining million is classified in other long term obligations 
if actual circumstances prove to be materially different than the amounts management has estimated  our total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
if we were unable to receive any of our estimated but uncommitted sublease income in the future  the additional charge would be approximately million 
adjustments to the facilities consolidation charge will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
we do not expect the future payments to have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our strong cash position billion of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at january

fiscal interest expense write down of equity investments net gains losses on sale of equity investments foreign exchange loss interest income and other  net total interest and other  net interest expense is correlated with the convertible debt and the long term debt related to the land lease which was paid off and replaced in the third quarter of fiscal with the million of notes payable 
interest expense increased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of our adoption of fin in august  when we accounted for interest on the land lease debt as a component of interest expense 
prior to adopting fin  we classified this interest as an operating expense 
this change was also the primary reason for the increase in the interest expense from fiscal to fiscal the increase in interest income and other  from fiscal to fiscal was due to improved yields and volume on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the decrease in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower returns on our investments due to significant reductions in interest rates that occurred during fiscal  the partial impact of which was felt in fiscal and the full impact of which was felt in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  we recorded the net gain of million related to sales of certain other minority investments to unrelated third parties  which was offset by write down of equity investments related to the remainder of our investment in webgain of million 
during the preparation of our financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal  we concluded that the valuation of the securities was below the aggregate liquidation preference threshold at which bea would begin to participate in a return of its investment 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining net carrying value of million during the first fiscal quarter of we based this conclusion on the fact that we became aware of a lawsuit between webgain and a third party that we believed adversely impacted the valuation of webgain in addition to their adverse financial condition

based upon the available evidence  which includes our historical levels of us taxable income and stock option deductions  we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent that they are dependent upon future taxable income for realization

the operating cash improvement was driven by the following primary factors  a million reduction in period end net accounts receivable 
the decline in net accounts receivable contributed to a six day drop in days sales outstanding dso  and deferred revenues at period end increased million which was largely a result of continued growth in our installed base and customer support renewals  and net income excluding non cash charges increased million due to the increase in net income offset by the decline in depreciation expense and amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets  and a million change in other working capital components principally other long term liabilities  deferred tax liabilities and the non cash effects of exchange rates on other working capital items

revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 

table of contents revenue from software license agreements is recognized when the basic criteria of software revenue recognition have been met ie persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as license revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when licenses are sold together with consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery  provided that the basic criteria of software revenue recognition have been met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  and the consulting services do not provide significant customization of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
we do not provide significant customization of our software products 
the majority of license fees are sold with services and consequently are recognized in this manner 
revenue arrangements with extended payment terms are generally considered not to be fixed or determinable and  we do not generally recognize revenue on these arrangements until the customer payments become due and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in certain regions or countries where collection risk is considered to be high  such as latin america and certain asian and eastern european countries  revenue is generally recognized upon receipt of cash 
we have a number of strategic partnerships that represent our indirect channel including  system platform companies  packaged application software developers  application service providers  system integrators and independent consultants and distributors 
partners either embed or do not embed our software into their own software products 
partners who embed our software are referred to as embedded independent software vendors isv s  and revenue is recognized upon delivery of our software assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
partners who do not embed our software are generally referred to as resellers 
due to the particular risk of concessions with respect to transactions with resellers  we recognize revenue once persuasive evidence of sell through to an end user is received and all other criteria have been met 
our partner license agreements do not provide for rights of return 
services revenues include revenues for consulting services  customer support and education 
consulting services revenues and the related cost of services are generally recognized on a time and materials basis 
revenues from fixed price consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed on a proportional performance basis 
the total amount of revenue recognized under the fixed price consulting contracts was minimal to date 
our consulting arrangements do not include significant customization of our software since our software is essentially a pre packaged off the shelf platform that applications are built on or attached to 
customer support agreements provide technical support and the right to unspecified future upgrades on an if and when available basis 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the support period generally one year 
education services revenues are recognized as the related training services are delivered 
the unrecognized portion of amounts billed in advance of delivery for services is recorded as deferred revenues 
we occasionally purchase software products from vendors who are also our customers 
these transactions have not been frequent 
in such transactions involving the exchange of software products  fair value of the software sold and purchased can not be reasonably estimated 
as a result  we record such transactions at carryover ie net basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and record allowances when collection becomes doubtful due to liquidity and non liquidity concerns 
the allowance includes both an estimate for uncollectible receivables due to customers liquidity concerns and an estimate for uncollectible receivables due to non liquidity types of concerns 
these estimates are based on assessing the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analysis of such factors as our historical collection experience  collection experience within our industry  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  and current economic trends 
the allowance charges associated with non liquidity concerns are recorded as reductions to revenue and allowance charges associated with liquidity concerns are recorded as general and administrative expenses 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at january  to date  our actual losses have been within our expectations 

table of contents income taxes 
realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future us taxable income 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon available evidence  which includes our historical levels of us taxable income and stock option deductions  we have provided a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income at january  the resulting valuation allowance at january  is primarily attributable to accumulated stock option tax deductions and other  acquisition related deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize these deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited to additional paid in capital and goodwill when realized  rather than taken as a reduction of income tax expense 
bea is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
the company s provision for income taxes is based on jurisdictional mix of earnings  statutory rates  and enacted tax rules  including transfer pricing 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes and in evaluating its tax positions on a worldwide basis 
the company believes its tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on the company s effective tax rate 
facilities consolidation charges 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded a facilities consolidation charge for our estimated future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimates used in calculating the charge are reviewed on a quarterly basis and would be revised if estimated future vacancy rates and sublease rates varied from our original estimates 
to the extent that our new estimates vary adversely from our original estimates  we may incur additional losses that are not included in the accrued balance at january  conversely  unanticipated improvements in vacancy rates or sublease rates  or termination settlements for less than our accrued amounts  may result in a reversal of a portion of the accrued balance and a benefit on our statement of operations in a future period 
the maximum future cost associated with these excess facilities  assuming that no future sublease income is realized on these properties  other than for subleases that have been executed prior to january   and assuming that the landlords are unwilling to negotiate early lease termination arrangements  is estimated to be million  which exceeds the accrued balance at january  by million 
intangible assets and goodwill 
we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identified intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as purchased technology and non compete agreements are amortized over time 
goodwill is not amortized but rather it is periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently if events merit 
we perform this test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we have determined that we have only one reporting segment and one reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  which may initially indicate that goodwill could be impaired 
if we determine that such impairment could have occurred  we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill as defined by fas to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
impairment of long lived assets 
we are required to test certain of our long lived assets for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets fas  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be permanently impaired 
the most significant long lived asset that must be tested for impairment under fas is our acre parcel of land in san jose  california the san jose land  which has a carrying value of million including development costs of million at january  in accordance with fas  if we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present  indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the carrying amount of the asset would be compared to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  the fair value would be compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than 
table of contents the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the estimate of future cash flows that will be generated by us is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we are required to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict  particularly because the anticipated period of use for the san jose land extends relatively far into the future 
should different conditions prevail over this extended future period  a material write down of the san jose land of up to million including development costs of million could occur 
related party transactions webgain  inc bea held non voting series a preferred stock in webgain  inc webgain  a privately held software company 
other major shareholders of webgain included venture capital funds managed by warburg pincus llc  of which certain bea directors are managing directors 
during the preparation of our financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal  we concluded that the valuation of the securities was below the aggregate liquidation preference threshold at which bea would begin to participate in a return of its investment 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining net carrying value of million during the first fiscal quarter of we based this conclusion on the fact that we became aware of a lawsuit between webgain and a third party that we believed adversely impacted the valuation of webgain in addition to their adverse financial condition 
in fiscal  we sold a portion of our investment in webgain to wp equity partners 
this transaction resulted in bea recording notes receivable from wp equity partners 
the notes receivable were paid off when they came due on january  we recorded interest income of million in fiscal related to these notes receivable from wp equity partners 
loans to executives and officers we have secured notes receivable from two executives totaling approximately million as of january  we received million in fiscal to pay down a portion of one of the outstanding notes receivable balances 
these notes originated prior to june  and are secured by deeds of trust on real property 
they bear interest of percent and percent per annum  respectively  and are due and payable on april  and may   respectively  or upon the termination of employment with us 
the notes may be repaid at anytime prior to the due date 
subsequent to our year end  in march  one of the executive loans and its accrued interest totaling million was repaid 
in september  the company issued an unsecured line of credit to alfred s 
chuang  our chief executive officer  in the amount of million 
no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit at january  or common board members or executive officers we occasionally sell software products or services to companies that have board members or executive officers who are also on our board of directors 
the total revenues recognized by us from such customers in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
change in accounting principle in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in december this interpretation was superseded with fin r 
the modifications of fin to fin r did not impact our adoption 
since we adopted the interpretation in august prior to fin r and fin r did not impact our adoption  fin is referenced 
table of contents below 
fin required a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbed a majority of the vie s expected losses  received a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual arrangement or other financial interest in the vie 
prior to the adoption of fin  vies were generally consolidated by companies owning a majority voting interest in the vie 
we adopted fin on august   and consolidated the entity the leasing entity from which we leased a acre parcel of land adjacent to our current corporate headquarters in san jose  california the san jose land as of that date  as we determined that the leasing entity was a vie  as defined by fin  and that we absorbed a majority of the leasing entity s expected losses and received a majority of its expected residual returns 
this lease was commonly referred to as a synthetic lease  which represented a form of financing under which an unrelated third party funds the costs of the acquisition of the asset and leases the asset to a lessee bea  and at least percent of the third party funds represented at risk equity 
we originally entered into the lease in february in accordance with fin  we consolidated our interest in the leasing entity including the san jose land  which had a carrying value of million  on august  the san jose land was included in property and equipment  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at january  deferred financing fees of million were also recorded as of august   which represents the unamortized balance of deferred financing fees that were originally incurred by the leasing entity on our behalf 
deferred financing fees were included in other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at january  and will continue to be amortized over the remaining financing term 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reclassified million of previously capitalized development costs  primarily re zoning and architectural fees from current assets to the carrying value of the land 
on august   we also consolidated the leasing entity s debt of million long term debt related to the land lease  of which percent or approximately million was legally structured as a non controlling interest 
this non controlling interest was in substance additional long term debt of ours due to the percent residual value guarantee on the property  the non recourse feature of the underlying debt  and certain other provisions of the lease arrangement  and  accordingly  the non controlling interest was recorded as long term debt  instead of minority interest  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at january  prior to the adoption of fin  we expensed certain non cash interest costs associated with the land lease arrangement during the period from november  to july  totaling million 
these costs were recorded as accrued liabilities for land lease on our balance sheet 
on october   we repaid million of the long term debt related to the land lease  resulting in a remaining debt balance of million as of january   million of which was recorded in current liabilities as explained in the preceding paragraph and million of which was recorded as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in october  we entered into a four year revolving unsecured credit facility with keybank national association  as administrative agent  and various other lenders the credit agreement and borrowed million under the credit agreement in order to  among other things  pay off and terminate the long term debt related to the land lease discussed above 
prior to the adoption of fin  we had previously accounted for our involvement with the leasing entity as an operating lease and  accordingly  the land and related debt obligation were not recorded on our balance sheet prior to august  there was no cumulative effect of the accounting change on august  because the san jose land is a non depreciable asset and the total carrying costs recorded by us in connection with the san jose land from the date the land was acquired in february through july  would have been the same under the fin accounting treatment 
prior to the adoption of fin  the carrying costs associated with the land of approximately million per quarter were accounted for as rent expense  which was recorded as operating expenses and cost of services 
upon adoption of fin on august   these carrying costs are recorded as interest expense 
this change has no impact on reported net income  but did cause both our income from operations and our interest expense to subsequently increase by this amount for the year ended january  
table of contents effect of new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r sfas r share based payment  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expenses in the financial statements 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we currently measure compensation costs related to share based payments under apb  as allowed by sfas  and provide disclosure in the notes to financial statements as required by sfas we are required to adopt sfas r effective february  we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment to apb no 
apb 
this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges when required of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  which provides guidance under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp allows companies additional time to evaluate whether foreign earnings will be repatriated under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and requires specified disclosures for companies needing the additional time to complete the evaluation 
once a decision is made to repatriate the foreign earnings  companies must reflect the deferred tax liabilities attributable to foreign earnings in the period that the decision is made to remit those earnings 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of this fsp to the company 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no

additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
risk factors that may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in our actual or anticipated quarterly revenues and operating results have in the past  and may in the future  prevent us from meeting securities analysts or investors expectations and have in the past  and may in the future  result in a decline in our stock price 
our revenues have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
for example  in the quarters ended april   april  and april   our revenues declined as compared to the 
table of contents previous fiscal quarter  and in the quarters ended october   january   april  and july  our revenues declined as compared to the same quarterly periods in the prior fiscal year 
if our revenues  operating results  earnings or future projections are below the levels expected by investors or securities analysts  our stock price is likely to decline 
moreover  even if our total revenues meet investors and securities analysts expectations  if a component of our total revenues does not meet these expectations  our stock price may decline 
for example  in our quarter ended april   our reported license revenue was several million dollars lower than the level expected by securities analysts 
our stock price declined by approximately percent at the close of trading on the nasdaq national market on the day following our announcement of our quarterly financial results providing this information 
our stock price is also subject to the substantial volatility generally associated with internet  software and technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance  such as the substantial declines in the prices of many such stocks that began in march through  as well as market declines related to terrorist activities and military actions 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future revenues and operating results as a result of many factors  including difficulty predicting the size and timing of customer orders  particularly as we have become more reliant on larger transactions  the seasonality of our sales  which typically significantly adversely affects our revenue in our first quarter  the rate of customer acceptance of our weblogic platform products  weblogic communications platform products and other recently introduced products  and any order delays caused by customer evaluations of these new products  on going difficult economic conditions  particularly within the technology industry  as well as economic uncertainties arising out of possible future terrorist activities  military and security actions in iraq and the middle east in general  and geopolitical instability in markets such as the korean peninsula and other parts of asia  all of which have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce the size of orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could have an adverse impact on our international revenue  particularly in the emea region if the euro were to weaken against the us dollar  the performance of our international business  which accounts for approximately half of our consolidated revenues  changes in the mix of products and services that we sell or the channels through which they are distributed  changes in our competitors product offerings  marketing programs and pricing policies  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements from us or our competitors  any increased price sensitivity by our customers  particularly in the face of the continuing uneven economic conditions and increased competition  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and initiatives  such as our weblogic platform and weblogic communications products and our solutions framework program  on a timely basis and whether any such new products are accepted in the market  the lengthy sales cycle for our products  particularly with regard to weblogic platform sales which typically involve more comprehensive solutions that may require more detailed customer evaluations  our ability to further control costs and expenses  particularly in the face of the on going current difficult economic conditions  loss of key personnel  the degree of success  if any  of our strategy to further establish and expand our relationships with distributors  the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  the terms and timing of financing activities  
table of contents potential fluctuations in demand or prices of our products and services  technological changes in computer systems and environments  our ability to meet our customers service requirements  and costs associated with acquisitions  including expenses charged for any impaired acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast because of the timing  size and composition of our customer orders 
an increasingly material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
for example  in the quarters ended april   july   october  and january  there were   and product transactions each with a value of greater than million  respectively 
increases in the dollar size of some individual license transactions increases the risk of fluctuation in future quarterly results because the unexpected loss of a small number of larger orders can create a significant revenue shortfall 
for example  we believe this reliance on larger transactions adversely impacted our quarters ended april  and july   where our reported license revenue was several million dollars lower than the level expected by securities analysts 
if we cannot generate a sufficient number of large customer orders  turn a sufficient number of development orders into orders for large deployments or if customers delay or cancel such orders in a particular quarter  it may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and  more significantly on a percentage basis  our net income or loss in that quarter 
moreover  we typically receive and fulfill most of our orders within the quarter  and a substantial portion of our orders  particularly our larger transactions  are typically received in the last month of each fiscal quarter  with a concentration of such orders in the final week of the quarter 
as a result  even though we may have substantial backlog at the end of a prior quarter and positive business indicators  such as sales pipeline reports  about customer demand during a quarter  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until very late in the fiscal quarter  and possibly on the final day or days of the fiscal quarter 
not only could this significantly adversely affect our revenues  such shortfalls would substantially adversely affect our earnings because they may occur after it is too late to adjust expenses for that quarter 
moreover  because we have previously implemented significant cost cutting measures  incremental additional cost cutting measures would be particularly difficult to achieve 
the risk of delayed or cancelled orders is also particularly relevant with respect to our increased dependence on large customer orders  which are more likely to be cancelled  delayed or reduced and also have a greater financial impact on our operating results 
moreover  ongoing adverse economic conditions worldwide  particularly those related to the technology industry and the economic and political uncertainties arising out of the ongoing us military activity in iraq  recent and possible future terrorist activities  other potential military and security actions in the middle east  and instability in markets such as the korean peninsula and other parts of asia  have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls 
any revenue shortfall below our expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
the seasonality of our sales typically significantly adversely affects our revenues in our first fiscal quarter 
our first quarter revenues  particularly our license revenues  are typically lower than revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
we believe this is because our commission plans and other sales incentives are structured for annual performance and contain bonus provisions based on annual quotas that typically are triggered in the later quarters in a year 
in addition  most of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january and it is common for capital expenditures to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue 
moreover  because of this seasonality  even if we have a very strong fourth quarter in a particular year  the initial quarters in the next year could nevertheless still be weak on a year over year comparative basis  as well as on a sequential basis 
this risk remains even if the amount of our deferred revenue and backlog is substantial at the close of the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
this seasonality may harm our revenues and other operating results in our first quarter and possibly subsequent quarters as well  particularly if it is worse than we expect 

table of contents if we do not effectively compete with new and existing competitors  our revenues and operating margins will decline 
the market for application server and integration software  and related software infrastructure products and services  is highly competitive 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of this marketplace 
these competitors include ibm  which also offers operating system software and hardware as discussed below  and oracle  which can bundle its competing product with their database and other software offerings at a discounted price 
in addition  certain application vendors  enterprise application integration vendors and other companies are developing or offering application server  enterprise application integration and portal software products and related services that may compete with products that we offer 
further  software development tool vendors typically emphasize the broad versatility of their tool sets and  in some cases  offer complementary software that supports these tools and performs basic application server and integration functions 
these tool vendors offer products that may compete with some of the features of our own product offerings 
finally  internal development groups within prospective customers organizations may develop software and hardware systems that may substitute for those we offer 
a number of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than us 
some of our competitors are also hardware vendors who bundle their own application server  integration software and tool products  or similar products  with their computer systems and database vendors that advocate client server networks driven by the database server 
ibm is the primary hardware vendor that we compete with which offers a line of application server  integration  and related software infrastructure solutions for their customers 
sun microsystems is another hardware vendor which offers a line of application server and related software infrastructure solutions 
ibm s sale of application server and integration functionality along with its proprietary hardware systems requires us to compete with ibm  particularly with regard to its installed customer base  where ibm has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and the integration of its enterprise application server and integration functionality with its proprietary hardware and database systems 
these inherent advantages allow ibm to bundle  at a discounted price  application server and integration solutions with computer hardware  software and related service sales 
in addition  ibm global services  a division of ibm and a large provider of consulting and information technology services  can influence their service customers choice of software products in favor of ibm s 
in addition  these advantages allow ibm to promote their competing products by selling at a discount their mainframe operating system software to their numerous mainframe hardware customers who purchase on a bundled basis ibm application server and integration software 
due to these factors  if we do not sufficiently differentiate our products based on functionality  reliability  ease of development  interoperability with non ibm systems  performance  total cost of ownership and return on investment and establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs  our business  operating results  and financial condition will suffer 
in addition to its current products which include some application server functionality  microsoft has announced that it intends to continue to enhance the application server and integration functionalities in its 
net technologies 
microsoft s 
net technologies use a proprietary programming environment that competes with the java based environment of our products 
a widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net technologies  particularly among the large and mid sized enterprises from which most of our revenues are generated  could curtail the use of java and therefore adversely impact the sales of our products 
the 
net technologies and the bundling of competing functionality in versions of windows can require us to compete in certain areas with microsoft  which has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  its greater name recognition  very large developer community  its substantial installed base and the integration of its broad product line and features into a web services environment 
we need to differentiate our products from microsoft s based on scalability  functionality  interoperability with non microsoft platforms  performance  total cost of ownership  return on investment  ease of development and reliability  and need to establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs 
we may not be able to successfully or sufficiently differentiate our products from those offered by microsoft  and microsoft s continued efforts in the application server  integration and web services markets  as well as their ongoing efforts to enhance and expand the 
net technology program  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of their current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to sell additional software licenses and maintenance  consulting and support services on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
the lengthy sales cycle for our products makes our revenues susceptible to substantial fluctuations 
many of our customers use our products to implement large  sophisticated applications that are critical to their business  and their purchases are often part of their implementation of a distributed or web based computing environment 
customers evaluating our software products face complex decisions regarding alternative approaches to the integration of enterprise applications  competitive product offerings  rapidly changing software technologies and standards and limited internal resources due to other information systems requirements 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and is subject to delays or cancellation over which we have little or no control 
we have recently experienced an increase in the number of million and multimillion dollar license transactions 
for example  in the quarters ended april   july   october  and january  there were   and product transactions  respectively  each with a value at greater than million 
some of our transactions are significantly larger than million  such as in our quarter ended july   when we had a single transaction with a value of over million 
in some cases  the larger size of the transactions has resulted in more extended customer evaluation and procurement processes  which in turn have lengthened the overall sales cycle for our products 
the recent economic downturn in our key markets has also contributed to increasing the length of our sales cycle  and there is a risk that this could continue or worsen 
finally  the introduction of weblogic platform products has contributed to a longer sales cycle due to the fact that it offers a more comprehensive solution that may require more detailed customer evaluations 
delays or failures to complete large orders and sales in a particular quarter could significantly reduce revenue that quarter  as well as subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale would likely be recognized 
if our weblogic platform products do not achieve significant market acceptance  or market acceptance is delayed  our revenues will be substantially adversely affected 
in july  we introduced our weblogic platform group of products  a major new product release which includes weblogic server  weblogic workshop  weblogic integration and weblogic portal more recently  in february we released the first product of our weblogic communications platform 
we have invested substantial resources to develop and market these products  and anticipate that this will continue 
if these products and our other products currently in development do not achieve substantial market acceptance among new and existing customers  due to factors such as any technological problems  competition  pricing  sales execution or market shifts  it will have a material adverse effect on our revenues and other operating results 
for example  we believe the rate of acceptance of  and customer transition to  weblogic platform were contributing factors to our reported license revenue for our quarter ended april  being several million dollars lower than the level expected by securities analysts 
moreover  because the weblogic platform products offer broader solutions and other improvements over our prior products  potential customers may take additional time to evaluate their purchases  which can delay customer acceptance of our weblogic platform products 
if these delays continue or worsen  it will adversely affect our revenues and other operating results 
our international operations expose us to greater management  collections  currency  export licensing  intellectual property  tax  regulatory and other risks 
revenues from markets outside of the americas accounted and of our total revenues in the years ended january  and  respectively 
we sell our products and services through a network of branches and subsidiaries located in countries worldwide 
in addition  we also market our products through distributors 
we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including greater difficulties in maintaining and enforcing us accounting and public reporting standards  greater difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  unexpected changes 
table of contents in regulatory practices and tariffs  longer collection cycles  seasonality  potential changes in export licensing and tax laws  and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights 
also  the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business can significantly impact our revenues 
for example  a strengthening of the us dollar could have an unexpected adverse impact on our international revenue 
this is particularly relevant with regards to our sales generated in the emea region where the us dollar has recently been exceptionally weak relative to european currencies 
the emea region accounted for percent of our revenue in our quarter ended january   and if the value of the us dollar relative to the european currencies were to significantly increase  it would have an unexpected adverse impact on our revenues  profits and other operating results 
also  we are periodically subject to tax audits by government agencies in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  the outcomes of these audits have not had a material impact on us 
it is possible  however  that future audits could result in significant assessments against us or our employees for transfer taxes  payroll taxes  income taxes  or other taxes as well as related employee and other claims which could adversely effect our operating results 
general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets  including the military action in the middle east and geopolitical instabilities on the korean peninsula and other parts of asia may also impact our international revenues  as such conditions may cause decreases in demand or impact our ability to collect payment from our customers 
there can be no assurances that these factors and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues and consequently on our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are derived primarily from a single group of similar and related products and related services  and a decline in demand or prices for these products or services could substantially adversely affect our operating results 
we currently derive the majority of our license and service revenues from bea weblogic server products  bea tuxedo and from related products and services 
we expect these products and services to continue to account for the majority of our revenues in the immediate future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for bea weblogic server products  bea tuxedo or related services  such as a continued or worsened general economic slowdown  future terrorist activities or military actions  any decline in overall market demand  competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  with regard to bea tuxedo  we have recently experienced a decline in the percentage of our license revenue generated by bea tuxedo  as well as a decline in the absolute dollar amount of revenue generated by bea tuxedo 
if this trend were to continue or worsen  it would have an adverse impact on our revenue  profit and other operating results 
changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue and profits 
although we use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in larger license transactions 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and  in certain situations  may require us to defer recognition of revenue on the license 
while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  the american institute of certified public accountants continues to issue implementation guidelines for these standards and the accounting profession continues to discuss a wide range of potential interpretations 
additional implementation guidelines  and changes in interpretations of such guidelines  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or to recognize lower revenue and profits 
moreover  policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  accounting for acquisitions  income taxes  facilities consolidation charges  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
to the extent that management s judgment is incorrect  it could result in an adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under re examination by accounting standard setters and regulators 
these standard setters and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse changes to our accounting policies 

table of contents fasb has adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
r fas r  share based payment  replaces fas which eliminates the ability to account for compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using the fair value based method 
accordingly  we will be required to expense stock options granted in fiscal periods commencing february  when we record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we will have significant compensation charges 
for example  for the year ended january  and january   had we accounted for stock based compensation plans under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb statement no 
 diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by and per share  respectively 
the implementation of recently adopted accounting regulations requiring us to expense stock options will make it substantially more likely that we will experience net losses 
we first reported significant net income under generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended july  however  despite this  we subsequently reported a net loss for the quarter ended october  this was due in part to the asset impairment charges of million related to prior acquisitions 
when we are required by fasb r to expense stock option grants for fiscal periods commencing february   we will have significant accounting charges which will make it substantially more likely we could experience net losses 
moreover  these new accounting changes will make it much more likely that we will experience additional net losses due to such factors as any on going expenses associated with our prior acquisitions  the possibility of future impairment charges and the possibility of future charges related to any future facilities consolidation or work force reductions 
if we are required to remit significant payroll taxes  it will have an adverse impact on our future financial results 
when our employees exercise certain stock options  we are subject to employer payroll taxes on the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
these payroll taxes are determined by the tax rates in effect in the employee s taxing jurisdiction and are treated as an expense in the period in which the exercise occurs 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material  in particular if an increase in our stock price causes a significant number of employees to exercise their options 
however  because we are unable to predict our stock price  the number of exercises  or the country of exercise during any particular period  we cannot predict the amount  if any  of employer payroll tax expense that will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
stock price increases make it more likely that option holders will exercise their options and  accordingly  that we would incur higher payroll taxes 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing this assessment 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
the ongoing us military activity in iraq and any terrorist activities could adversely affect our revenues and operations 
the us military activity in iraq  terrorist activities and related military and security operations have in the past disrupted economic activity throughout the united states and much of the world 
this significantly adversely 
table of contents impacted our operations and our ability to generate revenues in the past and may also again in the future 
an unfavorable course of events in the future related to the ongoing us military activity in iraq  any other military or security operations  particularly with regard to the middle east  any future terrorist activities  or the geopolitical tension on the korean peninsula could have a similar or worse effect on our operating results  particularly if such attacks or operations occur in the last month or weeks of our fiscal quarter or are significant enough to further weaken the us or global economy 
in particular  such activities and operations could result in reductions in information technology spending  order deferrals  and reductions or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services 
any failure to maintain on going sales through distribution channels could result in lower revenues 
to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as computer hardware companies  packaged application software developers  independent software vendors isvs  systems integrators sis and independent consultants  independent software tool vendors and distributors 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in maintaining existing relationships and further establishing and expanding relationships with distributors  isvs  original equipment manufacturers oems and sis 
in particular  we have an ongoing initiative to further establish and expand relationships with our distributors through these sales channels  especially isvs and sis 
a significant part of this initiative is to recruit and train a large number of consultants employed by sis and induce these sis to more broadly use our products in their consulting practices  as well as to embed our technology in products that our isv customers offer 
we intend to continue this initiative and to seek distribution arrangements with additional isvs to embed our weblogic server and other products in their products 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully expand our distribution channels  secure agreements with additional sis and isvs on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and otherwise adequately continue to develop and maintain our relationships with indirect sales channels 
moreover  even if we succeed in these endeavors  it still may not increase our revenues 
in particular  we need to carefully monitor the development and scope of our indirect sales channels and create appropriate pricing  sales force compensation and other distribution parameters to help ensure these indirect channels do not conflict with or curtail our direct sales 
if we invest resources in these types of expansion and our overall revenues do not correspondingly increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we already rely on formal and informal relationships with a number of consulting and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to implementation and support of our products as well as lead generation and assistance in the sales process 
we will need to expand our relationships with third parties in order to support license revenue growth 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our principal competitors 
it is possible that these and other third parties will not provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers  or that we will not be able to maintain an effective  long term relationship with these third parties 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified personnel  it will adversely affect our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase revenue 
we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including our chairman  chief executive officer and president  alfred s 
chuang  other key members of management and other key technical employees 
competition for these types of employees is intense  and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our key employees and that we will not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining qualified candidates in the future 
in addition  as we seek to expand our global organization  the hiring of qualified sales  technical and support personnel has been  and will continue to be  difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain key personnel  and to promptly replace key members of management who have resigned  would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
third parties could assert that our software products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to increased costs and litigation 
we have been and continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business  including claims currently being asserted that our products infringe certain patent rights  such as the claims alleged by software ag and software ag  inc see item in part i entitled legal proceedings for a discussion of 
table of contents the software ag and software ag  inc matters 
it is possible that third parties  including competitors  technology partners  and other technology companies  could successfully claim that our current or future products  whether developed internally or acquired  infringe their rights  including their trade secret  copyright and patent rights 
these types of claims  with or without merit  can cause costly litigation that absorbs significant management time  as well as impede our sales efforts due to any uncertainty as to the outcome  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
these types of claims  with or without merit  could also cause us to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts  cease offering of any subject technology or products altogether  require us to enter into royalty or license agreements  compel us to license software under unfavorable terms  and damage our ability to sell products due to any uncertainty generated as to intellectual property ownership 
if required  we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition  particularly if we are unable to ship key products 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including developments in the internet  changes in the software or technology industry  general market and economic conditions  further terrorist activities  military actions in iraq and the middle east in general  geopolitical instability on the korean peninsula and other parts of asia  and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or our competitors operating performance 
in addition  bea and many other companies in the internet  technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations in their stock prices  including recent rapid rises and declines that often have not been directly related to the operating performance of such companies 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our fluctuating stock price also carries other risks  including the increased risk of shareholder litigation 
for example  following the drop of our stock price in may  bea and a number of our officers and directors were named in class and derivative lawsuits 
although these lawsuits were dismissed  any similar suits in the future could divert management s attention from our business and have an adverse effect on our financial results and operations 
because the technological  market and industry conditions in our business can change very rapidly  if we do not successfully adapt our products to these changes  our revenue and profits will be harmed 
the market for our products and services is highly fragmented  competitive with alternative computing architectures  and characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving and competing industry standards  and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards  or changes in customer requirements could result in a decline in the markets for our existing products or render them obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to timely and effectively enhance existing products such as our weblogic server products and web services features  respond to changing customer requirements  and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and initiatives such as our weblogic platform  weblogic communications platform  weblogic integration  weblogic workshop  weblogic liquid data and weblogic portal products and our solutions frameworks initiatives that keep pace with technological and market developments and emerging industry standards 
in addition  the widespread continued adoption of java technologies and standards is critical to driving sales of our products because they operate in a java based environment 
the widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net technologies  which competes with java based environments and technologies  could curtail the use of java 
a decline in the ability or willingness of sun microsystems  inc  the creator and licensor of a substantial portion of the basic technologies and standards comprising java  to devote resources to promote and facilitate the adoption and further development of java technologies and standards  as well as to make these java technologies and standards available on sufficiently favorable terms  could also curtail the use of java by the software industry  including us 
if the rate of adoption of java technologies and standards were to slow or decline  and we were unable to successfully adapt our products to other technologies and standards  it would adversely affect the sales of our products and services 
it is possible that our products will not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace and that we will not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our existing products or products incorporating new technology on a timely basis 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or lack of customer acceptance of our products  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and 
table of contents financial condition 
in addition  our success is increasingly dependent on our strategic partners ability to successfully develop and integrate their software with the bea products with which it interoperates or is bundled  integrated or marketed 
if their software performs poorly  contains errors or defects or is otherwise unreliable  or does not provide the features and benefits expected or required  it could lower the demand for our solutions and our products and services  result in negative publicity or loss of our reputation  and adversely affect our revenues and other operating results 
if the markets for application servers  application platform  application integration and related application infrastructure software and web services declines or do not grow as quickly as we expect  our revenues will be harmed 
we sell our products and services in the application server  application platform  application integration and related application infrastructure markets 
these markets are characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our success is dependent in large part on acceptance of our products by large customers with substantial legacy mainframe systems  customers establishing or building out their presence on the web for commerce  and developers of web based commerce applications 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the use of the web to run software applications and continued growth in the number of companies extending their mainframe based  mission critical applications to an enterprise wide distributed computing environment and to the internet through the use of application server and integration technology 
the markets for application server  application platform  and integration technology and related services may not grow and could decline 
even if they do grow  they may grow more slowly than we anticipate  particularly in view of the recent economic downturn affecting the technology sector in the united states  asia and europe 
if these markets fail to grow  grow more slowly than we currently anticipate  or decline  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if our products contain software defects  it could harm our revenues and expose us to litigation 
the software products we offer are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects  especially when we first introduce them 
we may need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix any defects or errors 
any defects or errors could also cause damage to our reputation and result in loss of revenues  product returns or order cancellations  or lack of market acceptance of our products 
accordingly  any defects or errors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these risks are all particularly acute with regard to major new product releases  such as weblogic platform  which was introduced in july our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of our customers use of such products in mission critical applications 
if a claimant brings a product liability claim against us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products interoperate with many parts of complicated computer systems  such as mainframes  servers  personal computers  application software  databases  operating systems and data transformation software 
failure of any one of these parts could cause all or large parts of computer systems to fail 
in such circumstances  it may be difficult to determine which part failed  and it is likely that customers will bring a lawsuit against several suppliers 
even if our software is not at fault  we could suffer material expense and material diversion of management time in defending any such lawsuits 
if we cannot successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions  our revenues may decline and expenses may increase 
from our inception in january  we have made a substantial number of strategic acquisitions 
in connection with acquisitions completed prior to january   we recorded approximately million as intangible assets and goodwill of which approximately million has been amortized or written off as of january  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million against certain 
table of contents acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
if future events cause additional impairment of any intangible assets acquired in our past or future acquisitions  we may have to record additional charges relating to such assets sooner than we expect which would cause our profits to decline 
in addition  integration of acquired companies  divisions and products involves the assimilation of potentially conflicting operations and products including the maintenance of effective internal controls for the combined company  which diverts the attention of our management team and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in future quarters 
it is possible that we may not achieve any of the intended financial or strategic benefits of these transactions 
while we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future  there may not be suitable companies  divisions or products available for acquisition 
our acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the risk that we will not successfully assimilate the acquired operations and products  retain key employees of the acquired operations  or execute successfully the product development strategy driving the acquisition 
there are also risks relating to the diversion of our management s attention  and difficulties and uncertainties in our ability to maintain the key business relationships that we or the acquired entities have established 
in addition  we may have product liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products 
acquisitions also expose us to the risk of claims by terminated employees  from shareholders of the acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction 
finally  if we undertake future acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur additional debt obligations  incur large one time expenses  utilize substantial portions of our cash  and acquire intangible assets that would result in significant future amortization expense 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on june   the fasb pronounced under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas that purchased goodwill should not be amortized  but rather  should be periodically reviewed for impairment 
such impairment could be caused by internal factors as well as external factors beyond our control 
the fasb has further determined that at the time goodwill is considered impaired  an amount equal to the impairment loss should be charged as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the timing of such an impairment if any of goodwill acquired in past and future transactions is uncertain and difficult to predict 
our results of operations in periods following any such impairment could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to determine whether goodwill and any assets acquired in past acquisitions have been impaired in accordance with fas and  if so  charge such impairment as an expense 
in the quarter ended october   we took an asset impairment charge of million related to past acquisitions 
we have remaining net goodwill and net acquired intangible assets of approximately million at january   so if we are required to take such additional impairment charges  the amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may use our technology and trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patents may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in particular  we have  in the past  provided certain hardware oems with access to our source code  and any unauthorized publication or proliferation of our source code could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our products  and although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights that we hold 

table of contents if we are unable to manage growth  our business will suffer 
we have experienced substantial growth since our inception in that has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
overall  we have increased the number of our employees from employees in three offices in the united states at january  to approximately  employees in offices in countries at january  our ability to manage our staff and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial  disclosure and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  and information technology infrastructure  particularly in light of the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
in this regard  we are continuing to update our management information systems to integrate financial and other reporting among our multiple domestic and foreign offices 
in addition  we may continue to increase our staff worldwide and continue to improve the financial reporting and controls for our global operations 
we are also continuing to develop and roll out information technology initiatives 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully implement improvements to our management information  control systems  reporting systems and information technology infrastructure in an efficient or timely manner and that  during the course of this implementation  we could discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls  as well as past errors resulting there from 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
we could incur substantial charges to our consolidated statement of operations if we were to commit to a plan to sell and take related actions with regard to the acre parcel of land in san jose  california that is recorded on our balance sheet 
we purchased a acre parcel of land adjacent to our current corporate headquarters in san jose the san jose land to construct additional corporate offices and research and development facilities  however  we have suspended our construction initiatives 
the san jose land is treated as a held and used asset 
if management were to commit to a plan to sell the san jose land  the plan was put in motion and the sale of the san jose land was probable  the san jose land may then meet the criteria to be treated as a held for sale asset and  if the san jose land s fair market value at that time was less than the carrying value of million  we would have to write down the carrying value of the san jose land  which could result in substantial charges to our consolidated statement of operations of up to the carrying value of million 
we will assess the san jose land for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets fas  at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the san jose land may be permanently impaired 
in accordance with fas  if we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present  indicating the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the carrying amount of the asset would be compared to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset  or the relevant asset grouping  is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  the fair value would be compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
to date  no impairment losses on the land have been recorded under fas  however there can be no assurance that we will not be required to record a substantial impairment charge related to the san jose land of up to million if events or circumstances change and we determine that the value of the san jose land is impaired under fas we have a high debt balance and large interest obligations  which constrict our liquidity and could result in substantial future expenses and substantial cash outflows 
at january   we had approximately million of convertible notes outstanding and long term debt of million 
as a result of this indebtedness  we have substantial principal and interest payment obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could significantly harm our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on the convertible notes  the notes payable  and other indebtedness  future capital expenditures  payments on our operating leases and any increased working capital requirements 
to the extent our stock price does not exceed per 
table of contents share between december and december  for a requisite number of trading days to permit us to effectively force the conversion of the notes  we will be required to pay million to repay the convertible notes in december if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the convertible notes and the notes payable at maturity  we could attempt to refinance these debt obligations  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to these debt obligations at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default 
we have adopted a preferred stock rights plan which has anti takeover effects 
we have implemented a preferred stock rights plan 
the plan has the anti takeover effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the existence of the plan could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable

international revenues from each individual country outside of the united states were less than percent of total revenues in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal with the exception of united kingdom with million or percent of the total revenues in fiscal and million or percent of the total revenues in fiscal international sales were made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
fluctuations in the euro  british pound and yen would have the most impact on our future results of operations 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  export license restrictions  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts between our parent company in the united states and our foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall financial results 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than their functional currency 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
the foreign currency gains and losses due to exchange rate fluctuations are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts 
at january   our transaction exposures amounted to million and were offset by foreign currency forward contracts with a net notional amount of million 
based on exposures at january   a percent movement against our portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a gain or loss of approximately million

table of contents interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are primarily invested in interest bearing bank accounts and money market funds at the local operating banks

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas 
all of the cash equivalents  short term investments and short term and long term restricted cash are treated as available for sale under fas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  we reduce our interest rate risk by investing our cash in instruments with remaining time to maturity of less than two years 
as of january   the average holding period until maturity of our cash equivalents  short and long term restricted cash and short term investments was approximately days

the underlying security in these investments has a final maturity extending years or more 
if we were to reflect these investments based on their final maturity date  rather than reset date  these investments would be classified as long term  with the furthest maturity date extending to january  we are exposed to changes in short term interest rates through the notes payable of million  which bear a variable short term interest rate based on the london interbank offering rate libor 
the effective annual interest rate on this debt was approximately percent as of january  the annual interest expense on this debt will fluctuate from time to time depending on changes in libor and changes in our financial position as specified in the loan agreement 
a percent basis point increase in libor will generate an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million 
we are also exposed to changes in short term interest rates through our invested balances of cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  the yields on which will fluctuate with changes in short term interest rates 
a percent basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in an annual reduction of interest income of approximately million 
the annual interest rate on our million convertible notes is fixed at percent through the maturity date in december
