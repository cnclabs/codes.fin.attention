item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a multi national integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases 
our lead product thalomid r thalidomide is currently marketed for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum  or enl 
this product is more widely used off label for treating multiple myeloma and other cancers 
over the past several years  thalomid r net sales have grown rapidly 
the sales growth of thalomid r has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development  which has resulted in a broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline 
these include a pipeline of thalomid r analogs known as imidstm 
revlimid r  one of our clinical stage imids  is now being tested in multiple cancer trials  including ongoing pivotal phase iii special protocol assessment  or spa  trials in multiple myeloma  or mm  and phase ii trials in myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  mds with q deletion chromosomal abnormalities and mm that have the potential to result in fda approval in late or early given revlimid r s safety and efficacy profile  its large sales potential and the cost efficiencies we can achieve from marketing revlimid r through our established sales force  we anticipate the approval and launch of revlimid r  if it occurs  would result in increased revenue and earnings 
we believe that the sales growth of thalomid r  the growth potential for revlimid r  the depth of our product pipeline  and our strong balance sheet position  make us competitive within the biopharmaceuticals sector 
restatement following a review in december of our accounting treatment for the convertible preferred shares and warrants we received in connection with the december  litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed  inc and the children s medical center corporation  or cmcc  where in return for approximately million in cash we acquired all related entremed thalidomide analog patents  terminated the litigation and received preferred shares convertible into  shares of entremed common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of entremed common stock  it was determined that an adjustment to our consolidated financial statements was required for the years ended december  and for more information about the litigation settlement with entremed inc and related agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   based on what we believed was the appropriate accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  we wrote off the entire million relating to the convertible preferred shares  the warrants and the litigation settlement and did not recognize any gains or losses on the warrants during this accounting treatment was based on multiple reasons including entremed s financial condition and its continuing losses  the fact that we included the warrants along with the convertible preferred shares investment in applying the equity method of accounting  under which we wrote off the entire investment in december  and our inability to place a reliable fair value on the warrants given the significant number of shares underlying the warrants and  in our opinion  the inability to convert the underlying shares into cash even if the warrants were to be net share settled without significantly affecting entremed s stock price 
upon further review of the warrant terms  as well as the accounting treatment prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  and related derivative implementation group  or dig  interpretations  we have concluded that the warrants should be accounted for as a derivative instrument and carried on the balance sheet at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
in addition we reviewed the impairment of the investment in the entremed preferred shares 
we have concluded that the investment should not have been written down as of the date of the transaction 
accordingly we have restored the investment of million as of december  and reduced the net loss by a like amount 
under the equity method of accounting  we have recorded our share of the entremed losses in until the investment is written down to zero in the third quarter of we have now restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and the cumulative effect of the restatement through december  is an increase in other assets of million and a decrease in accumulated deficit of million 
equity losses in associated companies of million were recorded for the year ended december  interest and other income increased by million for the year ended december  and litigation settlement and related agreements expense decreased by million for the year ended december  previously reported diluted net earnings per share increased by and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the restatement did not have any impact on previously reported total revenues  reported net cash flows or the operating loss 
the following is a summary of the impact of the restatement on i our consolidated balance sheet at december  and ii our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and we have not presented a summary of the impact of the restatement on our consolidated statements of cash flows for any of the above referenced years because there is no net impact for any such year 
previously in thousands  except per share data reported adjustments as restated year ended december  consolidated statement of operations interest and other income    equity losses in associated companies   income before income taxes    income from continuing operations    net income    per share income from continuing operations per basic income from continuing operations per diluted net income basic net income diluted consolidated balance sheet other assets    total assets    accumulated deficit    total stockholders equity    year ended december  consolidated statement of operations litigation settlement and related agreements    total expenses    operating loss    loss before income taxes    loss from continuing operations    net loss    per share loss from continuing operations basic loss from continuing operations diluted net loss basic net loss diluted refer to note to our consolidated financial statements unaudited of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of the restatement on the and quarterly information 
in addition  certain prior year amounts in notes       and to our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the restatement adjustments described above 
factors affecting future results future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products  the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones  challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs 
the most salient factors are  in the near term  competition with thalomid r  including generic competition  and delays in the introduction of revlimid r and  in the longer term  failure to commercialize our early stage drug candidates 
near term competition with thalomid r while we believe that thalomid r will continue to be used as a treatment in multiple myeloma and that competing products will not eliminate its use  it is possible that competition could reduce thalomid r sales in multiple myeloma 
in addition  generic competition could reduce thalomid r sales 
however  we own intellectual property which includes  for example  numerous us patents covering restrictive drug distribution systems for more safely delivering drugs  including our system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  or steps r  distribution program  which all patients receiving thalidomide in the united states must follow and which are listed in the fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluation  or orange book 
these patents do not expire until the years we also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of thalomid r in oncology 
even if generic competition were able to enter the market  it is unlikely such products could do so before based on a number of factors  including the time needed to commercialize such a product and the fact that challenges to thalomid r will require a generic competitor to make a patent certification of non infringement and or invalidity of our patents listed in the orange book pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  which would then  in turn  entitle us up to a month stay of market approval of that generic equivalent 
by that time  we plan to have at least partially replaced thalomid r sales with revlimid r sales 
on october   we received an approvable letter from the fda relating to our thalomid r multiple myeloma supplemental new drug application  or snda 
the fda letter stated that sufficient support for an accelerated approval could be provided by the results of the completed eastern cooperative oncology group  or ecog  study comparing thalidomide plus dexamethasone to dexamethasone alone in previously untreated multiple myeloma patients 
the submission of this additional data and completion of required responses and its review by the fda may result in an accelerated approval of thalomid r as a treatment for multiple myeloma in the second half of delay in the introduction of revlimid r while we have made progress toward regulatory approval of revlimid r based on ongoing pivotal phase iii special protocol assessment  or spa  trials for revlimid r in multiple myeloma  a delay in the introduction of revlimid r or its failure to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile could adversely affect our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  other factors such as the availability of fda approved competing products for the treatment of mds could impact the market s acceptance of revlimid r 
in addition  our ongoing open label phase ii trials in mds and multiple myeloma have completed their targeted enrollment 
while the submission of an nda based on data from these trials could result in an earlier regulatory approval if the data were to be sufficiently compelling  it should be noted that the fda does not often grant approvals based on phase ii open label data alone 
failure to commercialize early stage drug candidates our long term success and sustainability depends on our ability to advance our earlier stage drug candidates through development and to realize the commercial potential of our broad product pipeline 
company background in  we were spun off from celanese corporation and in july we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
initially  our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
in  we discontinued the biotreatment operations to focus on our programs for developing small molecule compounds for cancer and immunology indications  and on our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program 
between and  our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development 
by  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and  in january we sold the chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation 
revenue from license agreements and milestone payments related to our cancer and immunology programs began to increase at this time 
in july  we received approval from the fda to market thalomid r for use in enl  a complication of the treatment of leprosy  and  in september we commenced sales of thalomid r in the united states 
sales of thalomid r have grown significantly each year  and thalomid r has become our lead product 
in  and we recorded net thalomid r sales of million  million and million  respectively 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering in which we raised proceeds  net of offering expenses  of approximately million 
in april  we signed a licensing and development agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis a license for focalin r  our chirally pure version of ritalin r 
the agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process 
it also provided for celgene to receive royalties on the entire family of ritalin r products 
pursuant to the agreement we retained the rights to focalin r in oncology indications 
in august  we acquired signal pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease 
in december  we acquired anthrogenesis corp  a privately held biotherapeutics company developing processes for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a successful full term pregnancy for use in stem cell transplantation  regenerative medicine and biomaterials for organ and wound repair 
in march  we entered into a three year supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  to distribute  promote and sell alkeran r  ormelphalan  a therapy approved by the fda for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary 
the agreement  which provides us with an fda approved oncology product  requires that we purchase alkeran r from gsk and distribute the products in the united states under the celgene label 
in june  we raised an additional million  net of expenses  through the issuance of million of five year unsecured convertible notes 
in october  through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of penn t limited  or penn t  a worldwide supplier of thalomid r  from a consortium of private investors for a us dollar equivalency of approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired and including working capital adjustments and total estimated transaction costs 
through manufacturing contracts purchased in this acquisition  we are now able to control manufacturing for thalomid r worldwide and we also increased our participation in the potential sales growth of thalomid r in key international markets 
following this acquisition  in december we revised the pharmion product supply agreement acquired in the penn t acquisition 
under the modified agreement  pharmion paid us a one time payment of million in return for a reduction in their total product supply purchase price from percent of pharmion s thalidomide net sales  including cost of goods to percent of net sales 
the collaboration also entails pharmion paying us an additional million over the next three years to extend the two companies existing thalidomide research and development efforts and a one time payment of million for granting pharmion license rights to develop and market thalidomide in three additional asian territories hong kong  korea and taiwan  as well as for eliminating termination rights held by celgene tied to the regulatory approval of thalidomide in europe in november in late  we entered into an agreement providing manufacturers of isotretinoin acutane r a non exclusive license to our system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  or steps  patent portfolio 
the manufacturers of isotretinoin have licensed these patents with the intention of implementing a new pregnancy risk management system to safely deliver isotretinoin in potentially high risk patient populations 
until  we had sustained losses in each year since our incorporation in for the years ended december  and  we posted net income of million and million  respectively  and at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since our inception  we have financed our working capital requirements primarily through product sales  public and private sales of our equity securities and debt  income earned from investment of the proceeds of such securities sales  and revenues from research contracts and license payments 
we expect to make substantial additional expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products 
we expect that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of increases in clinical trial costs  expenses associated with regulatory approval and expenses related to commercialization of products currently in development 
however  we anticipate these expenditures to be more than offset by increased product sales  royalties  revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and investment income 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue total revenue and related percentages for the years ended december   and  were as follows change to to in thousands net product sales thalomid r    focalin r    alkeran r   n a other n a total net product sales    collaborative agreements and other revenue    royalty revenue    total revenue    net product sales compared to thalomid r net sales were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to price increases implemented in the second half of and in the first nine months of the total number of prescriptions  which increased approximately from the prior year period  was offset by lower average daily doses 
focalin r net sales were higher in  as compared to  due to the timing of shipments to novartis for their commercial distribution 
alkeran r net sales were lower in  as compared to  due to supply disruptions earlier in the year  which lead to inconsistent supplies of alkeran r iv and consequently inconsistent end market buying patterns 
other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications  which are generated through our stem cell therapies segment following the december acquisition of anthrogenesis corp 
compared to thalomid r net sales were higher in  as compared to  due to the combination of price increases and oncologists expanded use of the product as a treatment for various types of cancers  especially first line use in multiple myeloma 
thalomid r net sales in also benefited from the market introduction  during the first half of the year  of two new higher strength formulations  which had higher per unit sales prices 
focalin r net sales were lower in  as compared to  due to the timing of shipments to novartis for their commercial distribution 
the alkeran r supply and distribution agreement with gsk was executed in march accordingly  sales for this product are reflected only in the period 
other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications  which are generated through our stem cell therapies segment 
collaborative agreements and other revenue revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources in included a million payment received from novartis related to their focalin r xr nda submission  approximately million related to the pharmion collaboration agreements  primarily thalidomide research and development funding and steps licensing fees  approximately million of umbilical cord blood enrollment  collection and storage fees generated through our stem cell therapies segment  million from steps use licensing fees  and approximately million from other miscellaneous research and development and licensing agreements 
the period included approximately million related to the agreement to terminate the gelclairtm co promotion agreement between osi pharmaceuticals inc and celgene  approximately million of thalidomide research and development funding and steps licensing fees received in connection with the pharmion collaboration agreements  approximately million of reimbursements from novartis for shipments of bulk raw material used in the formulation of focalin r xr and utilized in clinical studies conducted by novartis  approximately million of umbilical cord blood enrollment  collection and storage fees generated through our stem cell therapies segment  and million from other miscellaneous research and development and licensing agreements 
the period included approximately million for amortization of an up front payment and a million milestone payment received from novartis pharma ag in connection with the serm license agreement  million of licensing fees from pharmion  and million of other milestone and other miscellaneous payments 
royalty revenue royalty revenue reflects royalties received from novartis on sales of their entire family of ritalin r drugs 
the increases in royalty revenue were due to increases in the royalty rate on both ritalin r and ritalin r la as well as increases in ritalin r la sales by novartis 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands cost of goods sold    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of net product sales compared to cost of goods sold increased in from  primarily as a result of higher royalties on thalomid r  partially offset by lower alkeran r costs 
as a percentage of net product sales  however  cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower alkeran r costs 
profit margins on thalomid r remained flat  as the increase in cost of goods sold resulting from higher royalties were offset by higher net sales which were due to price increases implemented in the second half of and in the first nine months of compared to cost of goods sold increased in from  primarily due to significant growth in thalomid r sales volumes  higher royalties on thalomid r product sales and the introduction of alkeran r 
cost of goods sold also increased as a percentage of net product sales primarily because of the introduction of alkeran r  which has a significantly higher cost structure than thalomid r 
the increase in the percentage  however  was partially offset by higher gross profits on thalomid r due to price increases initiated during the year and by lower sales of focalin r which also has a higher reported cost structure than thalomid r 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor fees paid principally to contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs  costs of drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs  costs of other consumable research supplies  regulatory and quality expenditures and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities 
research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands research and development expenses    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenue compared to research and development expenses increased by million in from  primarily due to increased spending in various late stage regulatory programs 
these included phase ii regulatory programs for revlimid r in mds and mm  as well as ongoing revlimid r phase iii spa trials in mm 
compared to research and development expenses increased in from  primarily due to the initiation of several large studies related to our thalomid r and revlimid r clinical programs in the second half of research and development expenses in consisted of approximately million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million spent on other human pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality and regulatory affairs  million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs 
these expenditures support multiple core programs  including thalomid r  revlimid r  actimid tm  cc  pde tnf alpha inhibitors  other investigational compounds  such as kinase inhibitors  benzopyrans  ligase inhibitors and tubulin inhibitors  and placental and cord blood derived stem cell programs 
in  approximately million was spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million was spent on other human pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality and regulatory affairs  million was spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million was spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs 
in  approximately million was spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million was spent on other human pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality and regulatory affairs  million was spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million was spent on agro chemical programs 
for information about the commercial and development status and target diseases of our drug compounds  refer to the product overview table contained in part i  item i of this annual report 
in general  the estimated times to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows estimated completion clinical phase time phase i years phase ii years phase iii years due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical testing and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects is not reasonably estimable 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development  which would significantly impact the costs incurred in completing a project 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for sales and marketing and customer service personnel and other commercial expenses to support our sales force 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  outside services for legal  audit  tax and investor activities and allocations of facilities costs  principally for rent  utilities and property taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenue compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in from  as a result of an increase of approximately million in general administrative and medical affairs expenses primarily due to higher headcount related expenses and an increase of approximately million in sales force expenses primarily due to the creation of a sales operations group 
the sales operations group  among other things  manages pricing and reimbursement  corporate accounts  customer service and government affairs  as well as sales fleet expenses 
compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased in from  primarily due to first time expenses of approximately million related to our stem cell therapies segment following the december acquisition of anthrogenesis corp  an increase of approximately million in commercial expenses related to the expansion of the sales and marketing organization and an increase in customer service staff  and an increase of approximately million in general administrative and medical affairs expenses 
litigation settlement and related agreements in december  we entered into a series of agreements with entremed  inc and children s medical center corporation  or cmcc  terminating ongoing litigation relating to patents for thalidomide analogs and directly granting to us an exclusive license issued by cmcc for the rights to those patents 
under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with entremed  we paid entremed million for all thalidomide analog patents and associated clinical data and records  and the termination of any litigation surrounding those patents 
under the terms of a securities purchase agreement with entremed  we acquired from entremed  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase an additional  common shares for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately million 
the series a convertible preferred stock is convertible  at our option into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share provided  however  that the conversion price in effect from time to time shall be subject to certain adjustments 
dividends are payable prior and in preference to the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution to the holders of common stock 
we have the right to one vote for each share of common stock into which such share of series a convertible preferred stock could then be converted and with respect to such vote we have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of shares of common stock 
we completed an assessment of the estimated realizable value of the investment 
after assessing the level of our ownership interest in entremed  its history of operating losses and the fact that entremed is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in research and development activities with proposed products and research programs in the early stage of clinical development  the entire amount of such preferred stock was written down 
as restated  we ascribed a value of million to the convertible preferred stock 
we signed an exclusive license agreement with cmcc that terminated any existing thalidomide analog agreements between cmcc and entremed and directly granted to celgene an exclusive worldwide license for the analog patents 
we paid cmcc million in december and million in january under the agreement 
another million is payable between and the present value of these payments totaled million and was expensed in additionally  we entered into a five year sponsored research agreement with cmcc whereby we have committed million per year in funding 
additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs 
prior to the restatement  we recorded a charge to earnings for the cost of these agreements and related expenses of million in including the write down of the entremed convertible preferred stock and certain legal expenses incurred in connection with the settlement 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  vest after six months from the date of grant and expire after seven years from the date of grant 
the warrants also include a net settlement feature and as discussed in note  it was subsequently determined that they should be accounted for as a derivative 
we ascribed a value of million to the warrants as of december   which represents their fair value at such date 
acquired in process research and development on december   we completed the acquisition of anthrogenesis corp  which now operates as celgene cellular therapeutics  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  under which approximately million was allocated to ipr d and charged to expense at the acquisition date 
for more information on the anthrogenesis acquisition  refer to notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased approximately to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to changes in the fair value of the entremed warrants 
in  we recorded unrealized losses of million related to these warrants whereas  in we recorded unrealized gains of million 
this reduction was partially offset by higher returns on our cash and marketable securities portfolio which was largely due to higher average balances of cash and marketable securities as a result of the issuance of million of convertible notes  on june   as well as cash generated through operations and foreign exchange gains 
interest and other income increased approximately to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to unrealized gains of in the fair value of the entremed warrants partially offset by lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in equity in losses of associated companies as restated see further discussions contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote of our consolidated financial statements  during under the equity method of accounting we recorded million for our share of the entremed losses 
interest expense interest expense in was approximately million and includes twelve months of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the million of convertible notes issued on june  interest expense in was approximately million and only includes seven months of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the million of convertible notes issued on june  interest expense in was immaterial 
income tax benefit provision in  we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million  which reflects an effective underlying tax rate of 
our rate rose in from primarily due to federal tax expense and decreases in the valuation allowance available to offset income tax expense 
in  our income tax provision was approximately million and included income tax expense of million for federal and state purposes  offset by a tax benefit of million from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
in  we recorded a net income tax benefit of approximately million  which reflected income tax expense of million for state purposes offset by a tax benefit of million from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations and per common share amounts for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands  except per share amounts as restated as restated income loss from continuing operations    per common share amounts basic diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock utilized to calculate per common share amounts basic    diluted    compared to income from continuing operations increased in from due to an increase in total revenue of approximately million attributable primarily to an increase in thalomid r net sales partly offset by higher operating expenses of approximately million and a decrease in interest and other income  net of approximately million attributable to a million decrease in fair value of entremed warrants versus a prior year increase of million partly offset by an increase in interest income and foreign exchange gains and the inclusion in of equity losses of associated companies of million 
compared to in  we recorded income from continuing operations for the first time since our inception in income from continuing operations increased in from due to an increase in total revenues of approximately million attributable primarily to an increase in thalomid r net sales and first time alkeran r sales that resulted from executing the alkeran r supply and distribution agreement with gsk in march of and a million increase in interest and other income  net primarily due to a million increase in the fair value of entremed warrants 
partially offsetting these increases were higher operating expenses of approximately million and the inclusion in of equity losses of associated companies of million 
impacting the to operating expenses comparison were aggregate one time costs of approximately million incurred in the period million from the write off of acquired in process research and development related to the anthrogenesis acquisition and million associated with the litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed  inc and cmcc 
gain on sale of chiral assets in january  we completed the sale of our chiral intermediate business to cambrex corporation 
pursuant to the minimum royalty provisions of the agreement  we received approximately million and million in and  respectively 
for more information on the disposition of the chiral intermediates business  refer to note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher earnings  the receipt of million in connection with the december thalomid r development and commercialization collaboration with pharmion and a decrease in net working capital levels 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased approximately million from the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher earnings and the inclusion of million of spending in the period related to the litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed  inc and cmcc  partially offset by an increase in net working capital levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in included in the activities were cash outflows of million for the october acquisition of penn t  million for an investment made in royalty pharma strategic partners  lp  which is classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet  and million for capital expenditures 
partially offsetting these outflows were cash inflows of approximately million from net marketable securities sales 
included in the activities were cash outflows of million for net marketable securities purchases  million for the purchase of a pharmion corporation senior convertible note and million for capital expenditures 
in  approximately million of net cash was provided by investing activities  which was due to cash inflows of approximately million from net marketable securities sales  offset by cash outflows of million for capital expenditures  million related to the december acquisition of anthrogenesis and million for the value ascribed to the entremed convertible preferred shares and warrants received in connection with the december  litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed 
the company previously followed the common practice of classifying its investments in auction rate notes as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet 
it was determined that these instruments are not cash equivalents and therefore  the company has made a reclassification to its consolidated balance sheet as of december  in order to conform to the current year s presentation 
the reclassification resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a corresponding increase in marketable securities available for sale as of december  of approximately million 
the reclassification resulted in a net decrease of million in net cash provided by investing activities in  which was comprised of the following components  an increase in the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million and an increase in the purchase of marketable securities of approximately million 
the company did not hold such securities in net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  and included cash inflows from the exercise of common stock options and warrants of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in were cash inflows of million from net proceeds of the issuance of our convertible notes on june  currency rate changes negatively impacted our cash and cash equivalents balances by million in at december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  an increase of million from december  levels and reflects the inclusion of  shares of pharmion corporation common stock  of which  shares were obtained in connection with the march  conversion of the pharmion convertible note and  shares were obtained in connection with the september  exercise of pharmion warrants 
at december   the pharmion common stock investment classified in marketable securities had an estimated fair value of million 
we expect increased research and product development costs  clinical trial costs  expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products and capital investments 
however  existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale  combined with expected net product sales and revenues from various research  collaboration and royalties agreements are expected to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period less than more than in millions year years years years total convertible note obligations operating leases alkeran r supply and distribution agreement employment agreements other contract commitments convertible note obligations in june  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of unsecured convertible notes to qualified institutional investors 
the convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of payable semi annually commencing december  the convertible notes have a stock split adjusted conversion rate of per share  which represented a premium to our closing stock price of  after adjusting prices for the two for one stock split effected on october   on may  the debt issuance costs related to these convertible notes  which totaled approximately million  are classified under other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized over five years  assuming no conversion 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the noteholders can convert the notes at any time into  shares of common stock at the conversion price 
in addition  the noteholders have the right to require us to redeem the notes in cash at a price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed  plus accrued interest  prior to maturity in the event of a change of control and certain other transactions defined as a fundamental change within the agreement 
we have registered the notes and common stock issuable upon conversion with the securities and exchange commission  and we are required to use reasonable best efforts to keep the related registration statement effective for the defined period 
pursuant to the indenture governing the notes  we may not merge or transfer substantially all assets  as defined  unless certain conditions are met 
operating facilities leases we lease an aggregate of  square feet of laboratory and office space in warren  new jersey  under various leases with unaffiliated parties  which have lease terms ending between june and july with renewal options ranging from either one or two additional five year terms 
annual rent for these facilities is approximately million 
we also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes  insurance  utilities  maintenance and other operating costs 
we also lease an  square foot laboratory and office facility in north brunswick  new jersey  under a lease with an unaffiliated party that has a term ending in march with two five year renewal options 
annual rent for this facility is approximately million 
in november  we purchased land and several buildings in summit  new jersey  which will enable us to consolidate four new jersey locations into one corporate headquarters and provide the room to accommodate our anticipated growth 
as a result  we are currently exploring available to reduce or eliminate the financial impact of existing lease commitments on redundant facilities 
in connection with our acquisition of anthrogenesis in december  we assumed two separate leases in the same facility for office and laboratory space in cedar knolls  new jersey and have subsequently entered into one additional lease for additional space in the same facility 
the leases are for an aggregate  square feet with annual rent of approximately million 
we also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes  insurance  utilities  maintenance and other operating costs 
the leases have terms ending between september and april with renewal options ranging from either one or two additional five year terms 
in november of  anthrogenesis entered into a lease for an additional  square feet of laboratory space in baton rouge  louisiana 
the lease has a five year term with a three year renewal option 
annual rent for this facility is approximately million 
we lease a  square foot laboratory and office facility in san diego  california from an unaffiliated party  which has a term ending in august with one five year renewal option 
annual rent for this facility is approximately million and is subject to specified annual rental increases 
under the lease  we also are required to reimburse the lessor for real estate taxes  insurance  utilities  maintenance and other operating costs 
for a schedule of payments related to operating leases  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
alkeran r purchase commitments in march  we entered into a three year supply and distribution agreement with gsk to distribute  promote and sell alkeran r melphalan  a therapy approved by the fda for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary 
under the terms of the agreement  we purchase alkeran tablets and alkeran for infusion from gsk and distribute the products in the united states under the celgene label 
the agreement requires that we purchase certain minimum quantities each year for an initial three year term under a take or pay arrangement aggregating million over such period and is automatically extended by successive one year periods  unless at least one year prior to the renewal date  either party advises the other party that it elects not to extend the agreement 
at december   the remaining minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled million 
employment agreements we have employment agreements with certain officers and employees 
employment contracts provide for base compensation and an annual target bonus based upon achievement of our performance measures and annual increases in base compensation reflecting annual reviews and related salary adjustment 
the outstanding commitment for base compensation related to employment contracts as of december  was approximately million for and million for excluding any change in control provisions 
other contract commitments we signed an exclusive license agreement with cmcc  terminating any existing thalidomide analog agreements between cmcc and entremed and directly granting to us an exclusive worldwide license by cmcc for the analog patents 
under the agreement  we are required to pay cmcc million between and  the present value of which was expensed in additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs 
on october   the company  through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  acquired all of the outstanding shares of penn t limited  or penn t  a worldwide supplier of thalomid r  from a consortium of private investors 
penn t was subsequently renamed celgene uk manufacturing ii  limited  or cuk ii 
in connection with the acquisition  we and cuk ii entered into a technical services agreement with penn pharmaceutical services limited  or ppsl  and penn pharmaceutical holding limited pursuant to which ppsl provides the services and facilities necessary for the manufacture of thalomid r and other thalidomide formulations 
the total cost over the five year minimum agreement period is approximately million 
in october  we signed an agreement with institute of drug technology australia limited  or idt  for the manufacture of finished dosage form of thalomid r capsules 
the agreement requires minimum payments for thalomid r capsules of million for the three year term commencing with the fda s approval of idt as an alternate supplier 
the agreement provides us with additional capacity and reduces our dependency on one manufacturer for the production of thalomid r 
as of december   the fda has not approved such alternate supplier 
financial outlook in our january  earnings release  we set forth our initial earnings estimate for the full year although we believe that the january  estimate continues to reflect our current thinking  there can be no assurance that revenues or earnings will develop in the manner projected or if the analysis  on which the projection were based  were to be redone on the date hereof that there would be no change in the guidance 
revenues our initial financial guidance anticipates total revenue in the range of million  with thalomid r revenues targeted in the range of million 
our revenue forecast for the ritalin r family of drugs remains at approximately million  which includes a payment for the approval of focalin r xr 
our initial financial guidance does not include revlimid r product sales  nor does it include expenses associated with the potential commercial launch of revlimid r 
as regulatory timelines become more certain we will update this guidance 
r d expenses research and development expenses are expected to increase to the million range in important components of the increased spending include expansion of both united states and european regulatory programs directed toward hematological and malignant blood disorders  spending for the investigation of agents in solid tumor clinical trials  and the potential advancement of compounds in our discovery programs  including pde tnf alpha inhibitors  kinase inhibitors  ligase inhibitors  benzopyrans and placental derived stem cells into our pre clinical and clinical development pipeline 
sg a expenses selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase to the million range in  which includes increased spending for the commercial support of thalomid r and alkeran r and expand our commercial and manufacturing capabilities in the united kingdom and switzerland 
this guidance excludes the potential costs of employee s stock options 
new accounting principles in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which employee services are received in exchange for either equity instruments of the company  liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  that was provided in statement as originally issued 
instead  under sfas no 
r companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions measured at fair value 
this statement is effective for quarters ending after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 
emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  or eitf  was issued in february eitf stipulates disclosure requirements for investments with unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the provisions of eitf are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have complied with the disclosure provisions of eitf in september  the fasb staff issued two proposed fasb staff positions  or fsp proposed fsp eitf issue a  which provides guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases  and proposed fsp eitf issue b  which delays the effective date of issue for debt securities that are impaired because of interests rate and or sector spread increases 
we are currently monitoring these developments to assess the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations 
eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
in april  the eitf issued statement no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by a company that has issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to the right to participate in dividends when  and if  declared 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying the definition of a participating security and how to apply the two class method 
eitf was effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  and was required to be retroactively applied 
we evaluated the terms of our convertible notes and debentures and determined that none of these instruments qualified as participating securities under the provisions of eitf as a result  the adoption of eitf had no impact on the company 
eitf issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock  or eitf  is effective in the fourth quarter of eitf states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock 
eitf also provides characteristics to be evaluated in determining whether an investment in other than common stock is in substance substantially similar to an investments in that entity s common stock and thus  accounted for under the equity method 
for investments that are not common stock or in substance common stock  but were accounted for under the equity method  eitf requires discontinued use of the equity method of accounting prospectively for reporting periods beginning after september  previously recognized equity method earnings and losses should not be reserved 
based on the above guidance  the company concluded that is entremed preferred stock investments  which had previously been written down to zero under the equity method of accounting  was not in substance common stock as defined in eitf and therefore  discontinued use of the equity method of accounting beginning on october  prospectively  the company will account for such investment under the cost method since the preferred stock is not publicly traded 
this change does not impact the carrying value of the entremed preferred stock investment and accordingly  did not have an impact on the conpany s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition on collaboration agreements we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas 
for the early stage compounds  the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development 
the agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events  and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives fda marketing approval 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
continuation of certain contracts is dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones  however  none of the payments received to date are refundable regardless of the outcome of the project 
revenue under research contracts is recorded as earned under the contracts  as services are provided 
sab no 
updates the guidance in sab no 
and requires companies to identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in quarters beginning after june  if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
prior to the adoption of eitf  revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  were recognized when and if the milestones were achieved 
gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks we record an allowance for sales returns based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned 
we record medicaid rebate accruals based on historical payment data and estimates of medicaid beneficiary utilization 
we record chargeback accruals based on actual sales to customers who are covered under federally qualified programs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accounting for long term incentive plans the recorded liability for long term incentive plans was million as of december  plan payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the plan and to of the participant s salary for the plan and the maximum potential payouts are million and million for the and plans  respectively 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or  if higher  an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control 
business combinations the penn t and anthrogenesis acquisitions completed in october and december  respectively  have been accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method 
under sfas  the purchase price is allocated to the assets received and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
the initial purchase price allocations may be adjusted within one year of the purchase date for changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the resulting goodwill  which represents the excess of costs of an acquired entity over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and intangible assets are accounted for under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale  warrants to purchase up to  shares of entremed common stock and unsecured convertible notes issued by the company 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us government agency mortgage obligations  us government agency bonds  corporate debt securities and  shares of pharmion common stock 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended to be used to meet our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of all debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses  is included in interest and other income 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of the company s investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows duration fixed rate securities variable to to to to rate in thousands year years years years securities total principal amount       fair value       average interest rate pharmion common stock in march  we converted our million pharmion senior convertible note investment  which had accrued interest of approximately million  into  shares of pharmion common stock 
additionally  in september  we exercised a total of  warrants to purchase shares of pharmion common stock  which we had received in connection with previous transactions with pharmion corporation  ie  the november license agreement and the april securities purchase agreement 
as a result of these transactions  at december   we held a total of  shares of pharmion corporation common stock  which had an estimated fair value of approximately million based on the closing price reported by the national association of securities dealers automated quotations  or nasdaq system  and  which exceeded the cost by approximately million 
the amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost ie  the unrealized gain was included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in pharmion s common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment 
entremed warrants in connection with the december   litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed corporation and cmcc  we received warrants to purchase  shares of entremed common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire seven years from the date of grant 
based on entremed s closing stock price on december   of  the intrinsic value of the warrants is approximately million and the fair value using a black scholes options pricing model is estimated to be approximately million 
since the warrants give us the right  but not an obligation  to purchase the shares of entremed common stock  the warrants can never result in a cumulative negative charge to earnings 
convertible debt in june  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of unsecured convertible notes 
the convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of payable semi annually 
the convertible notes can be converted at any time into  shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of per share for more information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of million by approximately million  which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of the company s common stock to per share as of december  assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value  and an increase in the company s stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value
