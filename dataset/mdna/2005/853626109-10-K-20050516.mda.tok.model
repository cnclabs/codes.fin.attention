smsc competes in the semiconductor industry  which has historically been characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  price erosion and periods of mismatched supply and demand 
these and other risks and uncertainties  including potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation  are discussed in further detail within the section entitled other factors that may affect future operating results which appears at the end of this item other cautionary statements and risks and uncertainties may also appear elsewhere in this report 
overview description of business smsc provides semiconductor systems solutions for high speed communication and computing applications 
through the integration of its digital  mixed signal and analog design capabilities and software expertise  smsc delivers complete solutions that monitor and manage computing systems and connect peripherals to computers  to consumer electronics platforms and to one another 
the company addresses computing  communications and consumer electronics markets through leading positions in input output and non pci ethernet products  innovations in usb and other high speed serial solutions  and integrated networking products employed in a broad range of applications 
smsc is a fabless semiconductor supplier  whose products are manufactured by world class third party semiconductor foundries and assemblers 
the company conducts a significant portion of its final testing requirements in the company s own state of the art testing operation 
the company is based in hauppauge  new york with operations in north america  taiwan  japan  korea  china  singapore and europe 
smsc operates engineering design centers in new york  arizona  texas and germany 
key indicators management measures the condition and performance of the company s business in numerous ways 
among the key quantitative indicators generally used in this regard are bookings  sales and revenues  gross profit and operating expenses relative to sales and revenues 
the company also carefully monitors the progress of its product development efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of sales and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
smsc believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual future results may differ from these estimates  and to the extent that such differences are material  future reported operating results may be affected 
revenue recognition sales and revenues and associated gross profit from shipments to the company s distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are deferred until the distributors resell the products 
shipments to distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are made under agreements allowing price protection and limited rights to return unsold merchandise 
in addition  smsc s shipments to its distributors may experience short term fluctuations as distributors manage their inventories to current levels of end user demand 
therefore  smsc considers the policy of deferring revenue on shipments to distributors to be a more meaningful presentation of the company s operating results 
it allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that smsc sells through distribution channels and it better focuses the company on end user demand 
this policy is a common practice within the semiconductor industry 
the company s revenue recognition is therefore highly dependent upon receiving pertinent and accurate data from its distributors  in a timely manner 
distributors routinely provide the company with product  price  quantity and end customer data when products are resold  as well as report the quantities of the company s products that are still in their inventories 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  the company uses this data and applies judgment in reconciling any differences between the distributors reported inventories and shipment activities 
although this information is reviewed and verified for accuracy  any errors or omissions made by the company s distributors and not detected by the company  if material  could affect operating results 
shipments made by the company s japanese subsidiary to distributors in japan are made under agreements that permit limited or no stock return or price protection privileges 
smsc recognizes revenue from product sales to distributors in japan  and to original equipment manufacturers oems  at the time of shipment  net of appropriate reserves for product returns and allowances 
for these revenues  the company must make assumptions and estimates of future product returns and sales allowances  and any differences between those estimates and actual results  if material  could affect that period s operating results 
inventories the company s inventories are comprised of complex  high technology products that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market  and are reviewed for product obsolescence and impairment in value  based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
the company often receives orders from customers and distributors requesting delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times that are shorter than the manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to its customers  the company builds and stocks a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may or may not materialize 
historically  forecasts of customer demand  particularly at a part number level  are challenging and can vary significantly from actual future demand 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  customers may be allowed to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
these dynamics create risks that the company may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories 
when it is determined that inventory is stated at a higher value than that which can be recovered  the company writes this inventory down to its estimated realizable value with a charge to cost of goods sold 
while the company endeavors to appropriately forecast customer demand and stock commensurate levels of inventory  unanticipated inventory write downs in the future may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimated losses are based upon historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company performs credit evaluations of its customers financial condition on a regular basis  using information provided by the customers as well as publicly available information  if any 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in the customer s inability to make payments within approved credit terms  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets  are monitored and reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimated cash flows are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to factors such as technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the company s business model or operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is below the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill is tested for impairment in value annually  as well as when an event or circumstance occurs indicating a possible impairment in value 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  during which no impairment in value was identified 
unless an indicator of impairment is identified earlier  the next goodwill impairment review will be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal marketable and non marketable long term equity investments are also monitored for indications of impairment in value 
the company records an impairment charge against these investments when the investment is judged to have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
judgments regarding the value of non marketable equity investments are subjective and dependent upon management s assessment of the performance of the investee and its prospects for future success 
during the third quarter of fiscal  impairment charges totaling million were recorded against two such investments  both of which were subsequently sold during fiscal as of february   the company has no significant long term equity investments 
income taxes accounting for income tax obligations requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates  for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets resulting from these differences must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
at february   the company had million of deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities  all of which are considered fully realizable 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient future taxable income for purposes of realizing its deferred tax assets include increased competition  a decline in sales and revenues or gross profit  loss of market share  delays in product availability  and technological obsolescence 
legal contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies require management to assess the likelihood and possible cost of adverse judgments or outcomes 
liabilities for legal contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
there can be no assurance that any third party assertions against the company will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may subject the company to royalty obligations  product redesigns or discontinuance of products  any of which could adversely impact future gross profits 
results of operations sales and revenues the company s sales and revenues for fiscal were million  including million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues  compared to fiscal sales and revenues of million  which included million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues 
fiscal sales and revenues of million included million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues 
non pc i o products contributed of total product sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  as the company experienced strong demand in its non pc i o product lines  product sales for which grew by during fiscal non pc i o products include networking  connectivity and other products 
the company attributes the growing demand to the impact of new design wins  broader product offerings in these product lines  and the company s ongoing focus on aggressively identifying and pursuing market opportunities in its non pc i o product lines  which is consistent with the company s diversification goals 
despite an increase of more than in unit pc i o shipments during fiscal  as the company maintained its leadership in the market for these devices  product sales from pc i o products declined in fiscal  compared to fiscal  largely reflecting the impact of selling price attrition 
the company s pc i o business is concentrated in top tier  mainstream pc suppliers who are able to exert significant pressure on selling prices 
the company s pc i o product sales were also adversely impacted in fiscal by an accounts receivable collectibility issue with one of its taiwan based component distributors 
during the closing process for the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that this long time customer  whose credit history with the company had consistently been excellent  was experiencing financial distress and a lack of liquidity 
generally accepted accounting principles preclude the recognition of revenue when collectibility is not reasonably assured  and therefore the company did not recognize approximately million of product sales  of which the majority were pc i o products  to this distributor during the second half of fiscal the inventory for these product sales  which had a cost of approximately million  had already been shipped to and resold by the distributor prior to identification of the collectibility issue 
the financial condition of this former customer has continued to deteriorate and future collectibility of its obligations to smsc remains uncertain 
therefore  the million of inventory shipped to this customer  but not yet paid for  is reflected within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal the company aggressively arranged alternate channels for delivery of products to its end customers  and no disruption occurred in the supply of the company s products 
product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase reflected higher product sales in all of smsc s major product categories  in terms of both units and dollars 
new design wins and increased pc demand  following sluggish fiscal demand which reflected  in part  that period s business downturn in the semiconductor market  helped to drive growth in sales of pc i o products  which increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the company s non pc i o products achieved higher fiscal product sales reflecting the impact of new product introductions 
product sales of non pc i o products increased in fiscal over fiscal intellectual property revenues include million and million in fiscal and  respectively  received from intel corporation pursuant to the terms of a september business agreement 
intellectual property revenues for fiscal include payments under this agreement of million in each of the year s four fiscal quarters  and in the prior fiscal year include the agreement s initial payment of million in the third quarter and a payment of million in the fourth quarter 
sales and revenues by geographic region for the past three fiscal years were as follows in thousands for the years ended february or  north america    taiwan    japan  china and other asia pacific    europe and rest of world    intellectual property revenues received from intel are included within north america  accounting for the increase in north american sales and revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal although intellectual property revenues from intel declined in fiscal  pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreement  overall north american sales and revenues increased in fiscal reflecting increased shipments to a us based customer 
for product sales to electronic component distributors  their geographic locations  as reflected in the preceding table  may be different from the geographic locations of their end customers 
the company expects that international shipments  particularly to asia  will continue to represent a significant portion of its sales and revenues for the foreseeable future 
a significant portion of the world s high technology manufacturing and assembly activity occurs in asia  where many of the company s significant customers conduct business 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  including mask and tooling costs  costs for assembly  packaging  and mechanical and electrical testing  manufacturing overhead  quality assurance and other support overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product royalties paid to suppliers of intellectual property incorporated into the company s devices  and provisions for excess  slow moving or obsolete inventories 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales and revenues  compared to million  or of sales and revenues  in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales and revenues 
excluding the impact of intellectual property revenues  gross profit was of product sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to experience a change in its product mix  with more of its product sales being derived from non pc i o products 
while in the past  non pc i o products traditionally produced higher gross profit margins than pc i o products  the company introduced certain new products during fiscal into a very competitive market that currently generate lower gross profit margins than other non pc i o products 
accordingly  the company is not currently realizing the overall increased gross profit percentage at the level that would otherwise be expected from a higher product sales mix of non pc i o products 
the company is working on increasing its margins through design changes  enhanced product features and cost saving initiatives  as it continues expanding its new product offerings in these competitive markets 
the company also recorded higher charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting several customer product transitions occurring more rapidly than anticipated 
the slight improvement in gross profit percentage on product sales in fiscal  to  as compared to achieved in fiscal excluding intellectual property revenues in both periods  reflected the combination of lower wafer and assembly costs  an increase in unit production  lower inventory obsolescence charges  and a product mix shift towards non pc i o products 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware  subcontractor costs and device prototyping costs 
the company s r d activities are performed by highly skilled and experienced engineers and technicians  and are primarily directed towards the design of new integrated circuits and the development of new software drivers  firmware and design tools and blocks of logic  as well as ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 
the company intends to continue its efforts to develop innovative new products and technologies and believes that an ongoing commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership and compete effectively 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 
r d expenses for fiscal were million  or approximately of sales and revenues  compared to million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal this increase includes million of higher compensation and benefit costs driven by engineering staff additions  million of higher depreciation expense associated with investments in advanced semiconductor design tools and million of higher device prototype costs 
a portion of the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of sales and revenues in the current fiscal year  compared to fiscal  results from the higher intellectual property revenues reported in the prior year 
r d expenses for fiscal were million  or approximately of sales and revenues  compared to million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal fiscal r d expenses included a full year of expenses associated with the company s june acquisition of gain technology corporation gain  compared to nine months of such expenses in fiscal including the impact of gain  the increase in fiscal reflects the impact of engineering staff additions  which resulted in million in additional compensation and benefit costs  and million of additional costs associated with investments in advanced design tools 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal  and million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal the increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  includes million of higher legal fees  primarily associated with litigation  million of higher expenses associated with expanded worldwide resources in sales and marketing and million of higher consulting and professional fees  primarily associated with projects to achieve compliance with provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  includes million of higher expenses associated with expanded worldwide resources in sales and marketing 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  represents the amortization of intangible assets associated with the company s june acquisition of gain 
gains on real estate transactions during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its remaining parcel of idle real estate in hauppauge  new york  for net proceeds of million  after transaction costs 
this property had a carrying value of approximately million 
the contract of sale required the company to complete the remediation of certain soil contamination of uncertain origin identified at this property  at its expense 
in recognition of both the uncertain cost and uncertain completion date of the soil remediation obligation at that time  the company did not reflect the impact of this transaction within its statement of operations for the third quarter of fiscal the company subsequently completed the project during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and received final regulatory approval thereafter 
accordingly  the company recognized a gain of million on this transaction  after related soil remediation project costs  in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company sold certain portions of its hauppauge  new york real estate holdings  for aggregate proceeds of million  net of transaction costs 
these transactions resulted in an aggregate gain of million  million of which related to property in which the company had no continued interest and was recognized within the company s fiscal first quarter operating results  and million of which related to property that the company leased back from the purchaser and was therefore deferred 
this deferred gain is being recognized within the company s operating results as a reduction in rent expense on a straight line basis over a month period beginning in june  consistent with the term of the lease 
the company s remaining rent obligation over the term of this lease is approximately million 
settlement charge in june  smsc was named as a defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by analog devices  inc adi  which alleged that some of the company s products infringed one or more of three of adi s patents  and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
in september  the company filed an answer in the lawsuit  denying adi s allegations and raising affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and adi reached a settlement of this dispute  under which both parties agreed to dismiss all claims against each other 
as part of the agreement  the company made a one time payment of million to adi  which is reported as a settlement charge on the company s consolidated statement of operations for fiscal also as part of the settlement  adi granted the company a royalty bearing license to the patents in question 
the company does not expect royalties incurred under the license to have a material impact on future results of operations 
other income and expense the increase in interest income  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily reflects the impact of higher average interest rates during fiscal the modest decline in interest income  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflects a decline in interest rates on investments during fiscal  partially offset by higher levels of investments 
during fiscal  the company sold its remaining equity investment in chartered semiconductor manufacturing  ltd 
chartered  realizing losses of million  which are included within other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was nominal in both fiscal and provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate reflects statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates  the impact of certain permanent differences between the book and tax treatment of certain expenses  and the impact of tax exempt income and various income tax credits 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal  which reflects the impact of million of income tax credits  and million and million of tax benefits associated with export sales and tax exempt income  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  which resulted in an effective income tax rate of against million of income before income taxes 
this provision included million of income tax credits  million of tax benefits associated with export sales and a benefit of million associated with better than anticipated settlements of previously open tax audits 
the provisions for  or benefits from  income taxes from continuing operations have not been reduced for approximately million  million and million of tax benefits in fiscal  and respectively  derived from activity in stock based compensation plans 
these tax benefits have been credited to additional paid in capital 
discontinued operations the company had been involved in an arbitration proceeding with accton technology corporation accton and smc networks  inc networks  relating to claims associated with the october purchase of a majority interest in networks by accton from smsc 
the divestiture was accounted for as a discontinued operation  and accordingly  costs associated with this action  net of income taxes  were reported within loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
these costs totaled million and million  before applicable income tax benefits  in fiscal and  respectively 
in september  the arbitration panel issued its decision in this action  which directed the release of an escrow account to smsc and awarded certain other payments among the parties 
in december  the parties reached a final settlement of the award  resulting in smsc receiving million in cash  including the escrow account  and realizing a pre tax gain of million  which is included within loss from discontinued operations for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company currently finances its operations through a combination of existing resources and cash generated by operations 
the company had no bank debt during fiscal  or the company s cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments including investments in marketable securities with maturities in excess of one year  if any were million at february   compared to million at february  operating activities generated million of cash during fiscal  compared to million of cash generated in fiscal this decrease in operating cash flow during fiscal reflects million of higher intellectual property payments received during fiscal  as well as higher operating expenses incurred during fiscal  including a million litigation settlement payment 
the company also financed larger increases in accounts receivable and inventories during fiscal  compared to similar activity during fiscal fiscal operating activities generated million of cash 
investing activities provided million of cash during fiscal  due principally to a net decrease of million in short term and long term investments  and million of proceeds from the sale of real estate  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
investing activities consumed million of cash during fiscal  due principally to a net increase of million in short term and long term investments  million of capital expenditures and million used to purchase the minority investment interest in smsc japan  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of real estate 
investing activities consumed million of cash during fiscal  including million of cash used for the acquisition of gain and million of capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal included million of proceeds from exercises of stock options  partially offset by million of treasury stock purchases and million of debt repayments 
financing activities provided million of cash during fiscal  including million of proceeds from exercises of stock options  which were driven by increases in the market price of the company s common stock during certain periods of fiscal  partially offset by million of debt repayments 
financing activities consumed million of cash during fiscal  including million for purchases of treasury stock and million for debt repayments  partially offset by million of proceeds from exercises of stock options 
the company s inventories were million at february   compared to million at february  this increase resulted from the replenishment of depleted buffer stock inventories during fiscal  higher product demand expected in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the first quarter of fiscal  and certain accelerated purchases of high volume parts in response to apparent shortages in the supply chain during the middle of fiscal accounts receivable increased from million at february  to million at february  as noted within the sales and revenues section of this discussion  the company experienced a collectibility issue with one of its taiwan based distributors during the second half of fiscal upon identification of this issue  the company discontinued using this distributor  and redirected all of the business previously conducted with this distributor to different customers  some of which were new customers 
accounts receivable at february  includes certain accounts receivable from these new customers  to the extent that they were granted credit terms 
the company s accounts receivable portfolio remains almost entirely current as of february   and  as compared to the february  portfolio  has shifted towards accounts with shorter credit terms  which has the impact of reducing overall accounts receivable 
offsetting the effect of this credit term shift is the impact of a reduction in unclaimed pricing credits by distributors during fiscal smsc accrues a liability for distributor pricing credits when a distributor ships the company s products and earns such credits  but the issuance of the actual credit memo to the distributor is dependent upon the distributor s submission of an appropriate claim to smsc 
delays in distributors claims for these credits typically result in lower than expected accounts receivable balances  since the delays result in full collections for certain invoices against which the distributor is actually entitled to  but has not yet claimed  a pricing credit 
it has been the company s experience that all such pricing credits are ultimately claimed  although the timing of the claims varies by distributor 
these pricing credits are recorded as a reduction of product sales when accrued  and the resulting reserves for pricing credits and other allowances are accounted for as reductions of accounts receivable 
total current liabilities increased from million at february  to million at february   primarily reflecting a million increase in accounts payable associated with a higher level of inventory 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  of which million was paid in cash 
the current year s capital investments include expenditures of million for advanced design tools  which are being financed by the suppliers with payment terms extending through september the company acquired million and million of advanced design tools during fiscal and  respectively  under similar agreements  for which the vendors also provided extended payments 
payments under these agreements are reported within cash flows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were predominantly for production test equipment  advanced semiconductor design tools and investments in intellectual property 
capital expenditures were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  including the aforementioned vendor financed design tools 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal will exceed those incurred during fiscal  resulting from an expansion of the company s primary facility in hauppauge  new york  construction on which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal this project will expand the facility from its current  square feet to approximately  square feet  allowing consolidation of the company s hauppauge operations into a single facility  currently expected to occur during fiscal the company currently expects the cost of this building expansion to be between million and million  of which million has been expended  and is classified as construction in progress  at february  approximately million of the expenditures for this project are expected to occur during fiscal there were no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of february  during fiscal  the company filed claims for million of federal income tax refunds  which resulted from the carry back of several capital losses realized during fiscal against capital gains reported in previous fiscal years 
refunds of million were received against these claims during fiscal  and receipt of the remaining million refund is dependent upon completion of the related irs audit 
for income tax purposes  the company has approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards as of february   which are available to offset ordinary taxable income generated in fiscal and beyond 
smsc maintains a common stock repurchase program  as approved by its board of directors  which authorizes the company to repurchase up to three million shares of its common stock on the open market or in private transactions 
as of february   the company had repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of million under this program  including  shares repurchased at a cost of million in fiscal no shares were repurchased under this program during fiscal in march  the company announced the acquisition of of the outstanding common stock of oasis siliconsystems holding ag oasis  a leader in the development and marketing of integrated circuits that enable the networking and transport of digital audio  video  data and control information among multimedia devices within an automobile 
oasis is based in karlsruhe  germany and is supported by an engineering team based in austin  texas and several other offices worldwide 
the cost of the acquisition was approximately million  including approximately million of cash  million shares of smsc common stock  valued at million  and an estimated million of direct acquisition costs  including legal  banking  accounting and valuation fees 
included with the net assets acquired from oasis was approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  so smsc s net cash outlay for the transaction  including transaction costs  was approximately million 
up to million of additional consideration  payable in cash and smsc common stock  may be issued to oasis former shareholders during fiscal upon satisfaction of certain future performance goals 
the company s contractual payment obligations and purchase commitments as of february  were as follows in thousands payment obligations by period within between between total year and years and years thereafter operating leases    other obligations   inventory and other purchase commitments   total    inventory and other purchase obligations include purchase commitments for processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
the company depends entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture its silicon wafers and provide assembly services  as well as for certain of its test services 
due to the length of subcontractor lead times  the company orders these materials and services well in advance  and generally expects to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
for purposes of the preceding table  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the company cannot cancel these obligations without incurring cost 
non cancelable purchase orders for manufacturing requirements are typically fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons  generally three months or less 
the company has additional purchase orders  not included within the table  that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the company has considered in the past  and will continue to consider  various possible transactions to secure necessary foundry manufacturing capacity  including equity investments in  prepayments to  or deposits with foundries  in exchange for guaranteed capacity or other arrangements which address the company s manufacturing requirements 
the company may also consider utilizing cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company may evaluate potential acquisitions of or investments in such businesses  products or technologies owned by third parties 
the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents  liquid investments  cash flows from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to finance the company s operating and capital requirements through the end of fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

the personal computer industry demand for many of the company s products depend largely on sales of personal computers and peripheral devices 
reductions in the rate of growth of the pc market could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  as a component supplier to pc manufacturers  the company may experience greater demand fluctuation than its customers themselves experience 
also  some of the company s products are used in pcs for the consumer market  which can be more volatile than other segments of the pc marketplace 
the pc industry is characterized by ongoing product changes and improvements  much of which is driven by several large companies whose own business strategies play significant roles in determining pc architectures 
future shifts in pc architectures may not always be anticipated or be consistent with the company s product roadmaps 
product development and technological change the company s prospects are highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels  with acceptable margins 
the success of new products depends on various factors  including timely completion of product development programs  market acceptance of the company s and its customers new products  securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers  achieving acceptable wafer fabrication yields by the company s independent foundries and the company s ability to offer these new products at competitive prices 
the company s products are generally designed into its customers products through a competitive process which evaluates the company s product features  price  and many other considerations 
in order to succeed in having the company s products incorporated into new products being designed by its customers  the company must anticipate market trends and meet performance  quality and functionality requirements of such customers and must successfully develop and manufacture products that adhere to these requirements 
in addition  the company must meet the timing and price requirements of its customers and must make such products available in sufficient quantities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
the company s future growth will depend  among other things  upon its ability to continue to expand its product lines and products into new markets 
to the extent that the company attempts to compete in new markets  it may face competition from suppliers that have well established market positions and products that have already been proven to be technologically and economically competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in displacing these suppliers in the targeted applications 
price erosion the semiconductor industry is characterized by intense competition 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry generally  and for the company s products in particular  have declined significantly over the life of each product 
while the company expects to reduce the average selling prices of its products over time as it achieves manufacturing cost reductions  competitive and other pressures may require the reduction of selling prices more quickly than such cost reductions can be achieved 
if not offset by reductions in manufacturing costs or by a shift in the mix of products sold toward higher margin products  declines in the average selling prices could reduce gross margins 
business concentration in asia a significant number of the company s foundries and subcontractors are located in asia 
many of the company s customers also manufacture in asia or subcontract manufacturing to asian companies 
a significant portion of the world s personal computer component and circuit board manufacturing  as well as personal computer assembly  occurs in taiwan  and many of the company s suppliers and customers are based in  or do significant business in  taiwan 
this concentration of manufacturing and selling activity in asia  and in taiwan in particular  poses risks that could affect the supply and cost of the company s products  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  economic and trade policies and the political environment in taiwan and other asian communities 
reliance upon subcontract manufacturing the vast majority of the company s products are manufactured and assembled by independent foundries and subcontract manufacturers 
this reliance upon foundries and subcontractors involves certain risks  including potential lack of manufacturing availability  reduced control over delivery schedules  the availability of advanced process technologies  changes in manufacturing yields and potential cost fluctuations 
during downturns in the semiconductor economic cycle  reduction in overall demand for semiconductor products could financially stress certain of the company s subcontractors 
if the financial resources of such independent subcontractors are stressed  the company may experience future product shortages  quality assurance problems  increased manufacturing costs or other supply chain disruptions 
forecasts of product demand the company generally must order inventory to be built by its foundries and subcontract manufacturers well in advance of product shipments 
production is often based upon either internal or customer supplied forecasts of demand  which can be highly unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations 
because of the volatility in the company s markets  there is risk that the company may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories 
this inventory risk is increased by the trend for customers to place orders with shorter lead times and the customers ability to cancel or reschedule existing orders 
strategic relationships with customers the company s future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain of its customers 
if these relationships are not maintained  or if these customers develop their own solutions  adopt a competitor s solution  or choose to discontinue their relationships with smsc  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
in the past  the company has relied on its strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in its target markets 
the company intends to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future 
these relationships often require the company to develop new products that typically involve significant technological challenges 
the customers frequently place considerable pressure on the company to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  the company may have to devote a substantial portion of its resources to these strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay completion of other important development projects 
customer concentration a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of the company s sales and revenues 
the company s sales and revenues from any one customer can fluctuate from period to period depending upon market demand for that customer s products  the customer s inventory management of the company s products and the overall financial condition of the customer 
shipments to distributors a significant portion of the company s product sales are made through distributors 
the company s distributors generally offer products of several different suppliers  including products that may be competitive with the company s products 
accordingly  there is risk that these distributors may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell the company s products 
in addition  the company s agreements with its distributors are generally terminable at the distributor s option 
no assurance can be given that future sales by distributors will continue at current levels or that the company will be able to retain its current distributors on acceptable terms 
a reduction in sales efforts by one or more of the company s current distributors or a termination of any distributor s relationship with the company could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
strategic business acquisitions the company has made strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies in the past and may continue to pursue such acquisitions in the future as business conditions warrant 
business acquisitions can involve numerous risks  including unanticipated costs and expenses  risks associated with entering new markets in which the company has little or no prior experience  diversion of management s attention from its existing businesses  potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization  potential dilution of future earnings  and future impairment and write offs of purchased goodwill  other intangible assets  and fixed assets due to unforeseen events and circumstances 
protection of intellectual property the company has historically devoted significant resources to research and development activities and believes that the intellectual property derived from such research and development is a valuable asset that has been  and will continue to be  important to the company s success 
the company relies upon nondisclosure agreements  contractual provisions and patent and copyright laws to protect its proprietary rights 
no assurance can be given that the steps taken by the company will adequately protect its proprietary rights 
during its history  the company has executed patent cross licensing agreements with many of the world s largest semiconductor suppliers  under which the company receives and conveys various intellectual property rights 
many of these agreements are still effective 
the company could be adversely affected should circumstances arise which cause certain of these agreements to terminate prematurely 
infringement and other claims companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  the company has received notices claiming that the company has infringed upon or misused other parties proprietary rights 
the company has also in the past received  and may again in the future receive  notices of claims related to business transactions conducted with third parties  including asset sales and other divestitures 
if it is determined that the company s products or processes were to infringe on other parties intellectual property rights  a court might enjoin the company from further manufacture and or sale of the affected products 
the company would then need to obtain a license from the holders of the rights and or reengineer its products or processes in such a way as to avoid the alleged infringement 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain any necessary license on commercially reasonable terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be able to reengineer its products or processes to avoid infringement 
an adverse result in litigation arising from such a claim could involve the assessment of a substantial monetary award for damages related to past product sales which could have a material adverse effect on the company s result of operations and financial condition 
in addition  even if claims against the company are not valid or successfully asserted  defense against the claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and resources 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company is dependent in large part on the continued service of its key management  engineering  marketing  sales and support employees 
competition for qualified personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry  and the loss of current key employees  or the inability of the company to attract other qualified personnel  including the inability to offer competitive stock based and other compensation  could hinder the company s product development and ability to manufacture  market and sell its products 
internal controls over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires the company to evaluate the effectiveness of its system of internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  beginning with fiscal  and to include a report by management assessing the effectiveness of its system of internal controls over financial reporting within its annual report 
section also requires the company s independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of the company s system of internal controls over financial reporting 
the company s management does not expect that its system of internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must recognize that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  involving the company have been  or will be  detected 
these inherent limitations include faulty judgments in decision making and breakdowns that may occur because of simple error or mistake 
controls can also be circumvented by individual acts  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot provide assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
although the company s management has concluded that its system of internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of february   there can be no assurance that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the system of internal controls over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in the company s system of internal controls over financial reporting would require management and the company s independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate the company s system of internal controls as ineffective 
this in turn could lead to a loss of public confidence  which could adversely affect the company s business and the price of its common stock 
corporate governance in recent years  the nasdaq national market  on which the company s common stock is listed  has adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased  and may continue to increase  the scope  complexity and cost of the company s corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices 
as a result  the company s board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other corporate officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and officers  which would adversely affect its business 
further  these developments could affect the company s ability to secure desired levels of directors and officers liability insurance  requiring the company to accept reduced insurance coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
changes in accounting for equity compensation the company has historically used stock options as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board has recently adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles that will require a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning in fiscal to the extent that this or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  the company may incur increased compensation costs 
the company may also consider changes to its equity compensation strategy and find it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect the company s business 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock can fluctuate significantly on the basis of such factors as the company s or its competitors announcements of new products  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or in the financial results of other semiconductor companies  changes in the expectations of market analysts or investors  or general conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the financial markets 
in addition  stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has often had a significant impact on the stock prices of high technology companies  at times for reasons that appear unrelated to performance 
environmental regulation environmental regulations and standards are established worldwide to control discharges  emissions  and solid wastes from manufacturing processes 
within the united states  federal  state and local agencies establish these regulations 
outside of the united states  individual countries and local governments establish their own individual standards 
the company believes that its activities conform to present environmental regulations and the effects of this compliance have not had a material effect on the company s capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
while to date the company has not experienced any material adverse impact from environmental issues  no assurances can be given as to the impact of future environmental compliance requirements 
should environmental regulations be amended or an unforeseen circumstance occur  it could subject the company to fines  require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the primary objective of smsc s investment portfolio management is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  investments are placed with high credit quality issuers and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer is limited 
as of february   the company s million of short term investments consisted primarily of investments in corporate  government and municipal obligations with maturities of between three and twelve months at acquisition 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at february   the company estimates that the fair values of these short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
equity price risk the company is not exposed to any significant equity price risks at february  foreign currency risk the company has international sales and expenditures and is  therefore  subject to certain foreign currency rate exposure 
the company conducts a significant amount of its business in asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  most of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with its foundry  test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
most transactions in the japanese market made by the company s subsidiary  smsc japan  are denominated in japanese yen 
smsc japan purchases a significant amount of its products for resale from smsc in us dollars  and from time to time has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with these product purchases 
no such contracts were executed during either fiscal or  and there are no obligations under any such contracts as of february  the company has never received a cash dividend repatriation of cash from smsc japan
