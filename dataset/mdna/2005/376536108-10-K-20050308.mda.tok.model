overview we were incorporated under the general corporation law of the state of maryland on february  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial rental property and selectively making long term mortgage loans collateralized by industrial and commercial property 
we expect that a large portion of our tenants and borrowers will be small and medium sized businesses that have significant buyout fund ownership and will be well capitalized  with equity constituting between and of their permanent capital 
we expect that other tenants and borrowers will be family owned businesses that have built significant equity from paying down the mortgage loans securing their real estate or through the appreciation in the value of their real estate 
we seek to enter into purchase agreements for real estate that have triple net leases with terms of approximately years  with rent increases built into the leases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
at december   we owned twelve properties and had one mortgage loan 
we have also acquired two properties subsequent to december  we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
we conduct substantially all of our activities through  and all of our properties are held directly or indirectly by  gladstone commercial limited partnership  a delaware limited partnership formed on may   which we refer to as our operating partnership 
we control our operating partnership through our wholly owned subsidiary gladstone commercial partners  llc  which serves as the operating partnership s sole general partner  and we also own all limited partnership units of our operating partnership 
we expect our operating partnership to issue limited partnership units from time to time in exchange for industrial and commercial real property 
by structuring our acquisitions in this manner  the sellers of the real estate will generally be able to defer the realization of gains until they redeem the limited partnership units 
limited partners who hold limited partnership units in our operating partnership will be entitled to redeem these units for cash or  at our election  shares of our common stock on a one for one basis at any time 
whenever we issue common stock for cash  we will be obligated to contribute any net proceeds we receive from the sale of the stock to our operating partnership and our operating partnership will  in turn  be obligated to issue an equivalent number of limited partnership units to us 
our operating partnership will distribute the income it generates from its operations to gladstone commercial partners  llc and its limited partners  including us  on a pro rata basis 
we will  in turn  distribute the amounts we receive from our operating partnership to our stockholders in the form of quarterly cash distributions 
we have historically operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify as a reit for federal tax purposes  thereby generally avoiding federal and state income taxes on the distributions we make to our stockholders 
gladstone management corporation  a registered investment adviser and an affiliate of ours  serves as our external adviser our adviser 
our adviser is responsible for managing our business on a day to day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions and dispositions that it believes meet our investment criteria

each building is a single tenant facility and each was fully occupied at the time of purchase under previously existing leases with remaining terms of approximately five years  which were assigned to us at the time of purchase 
both leases contain an option to renew for an additional five years 
the leases provide for aggregate annual rents of approximately   from the pennsylvania property and  from the north carolina property

on october   we acquired four separate properties from a single seller a  square foot commercial manufacturing building in mt 
pocono  pennsylvania  a  square foot commercial manufacturing building located in norfolk  virginia  a  square foot commercial manufacturing building located in montreal  quebec  and a  square foot commercial manufacturing building located in granby  quebec

the lease provides for annual rents of approximately  through  with prescribed escalations thereafter 
expenses prior to october   our adviser had an expense sharing arrangement with gladstone capital advisers  a wholly owned subsidiary of our affiliate  gladstone capital corporation  through which our entire workforce was employed 
under that relationship  our adviser reimbursed gladstone capital advisers for a portion of gladstone capital advisers total payroll and benefits expenses based on the percentage of total hours worked by gladstone capital advisers employees on our matters on an employee by employee basis and a portion of gladstone capital advisers total overhead expense based on the percentage of total hours worked by all gladstone capital advisers employees on our matters 
in turn  subject to the terms and conditions of our advisory agreement  our adviser passed these charges on to us 
effective october   the expense sharing arrangement with gladstone capital advisers was terminated  and all of our personnel are now directly employed by our adviser 
pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement  we continue to be responsible for a portion of our adviser s total payroll and benefits expenses based on the percentage of time our adviser s employees devote to our matters on an employee by employee basis and a portion of our adviser s total overhead expense based on the percentage of time worked by all of our adviser s employees on our matters 
the termination of the arrangement between our adviser and gladstone capital advisers is not expected to materially change the level of our expenses 
during the year ended december  and the period february  inception to december   payroll and benefits expenses  which are part of the management fee paid to our adviser  were approximately  and  respectively 
the actual amount of payroll and benefits expenses which we will be required to reimburse our adviser in the future is not determinable  but we currently estimate that during the year ending december  this amount will be approximately  this estimate is based on our current expectations regarding our adviser s payroll and benefits expenses and the proportion of our adviser s time we believe will be spent on matters relating to our business 
to the extent that our adviser s payroll and benefits expenses are greater than we expect or our adviser allocates a greater percentage of its time to our business  our actual reimbursement of our adviser for our share of its payroll and benefits expenses could be materially greater than we currently project 
under the terms of our advisory agreement  we will only be required to reimburse our adviser for our portion of its general overhead expenses if the amount of payroll and benefits we reimburse to our adviser is less than of our average invested assets for the year 
additionally  we will only be required to reimburse our adviser for overhead expenses up to the point that reimbursed overhead expenses and payroll and benefits expenses  on a combined basis  equal of our average invested assets for the year 
however  to the extent that payroll and benefits reimbursements exceed the annual management fee cap of  these payroll amounts will be reimbursed by us 
our adviser will bill us on a monthly basis for these amounts 
our adviser must reimburse us annually for the amount by which amounts billed to and paid by us exceed this limit during a given year 
to the extent that overhead expenses payable or reimbursable by us exceed this limit and our independent directors determine that the excess expenses were justified based on unusual and nonrecurring factors which they deem sufficient  we may reimburse our adviser in future years for the full amount of the excess expenses  or any portion thereof  but only to the extent that the reimbursement would not cause our overhead expense reimbursements to exceed the limitation in any year 
to date  the advisory fee has not exceeded the annual cap 
during the year ended december  and the period february  inception to december   the amount of overhead expenses that we reimbursed our adviser was approximately  and  respectively 
the actual amount of overhead expenses for which we will be required to reimburse our adviser in the future is not determinable  but we currently estimate that during the year ending december  this amount will be approximately  under the terms of the advisory agreement  we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include  legal  accounting  tax preparation  consulting and related fees 
during the year ended december  and the period february  inception to december   the total amount of these expenses that we incurred was approximately  and   of which related to our initial public offering and was charged to additional paid in capital  and the remainder of which related to direct expenses was charged to operating expenses  respectively 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
during the year ended december  and the period from inception through december   we passed all such fees along to our tenants  and accordingly we did not incur any such fees during this time 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans we make  and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
critical accounting policies management believes our most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition including straight line rent  purchase price allocation  accounting for our investments in real estate  provision for loans losses  the accounting for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  income taxes and stock based compensation 
each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
management relies on its experience  collects historical data and current market data  and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition rental revenues include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease 
because certain of our leases contain rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset  and include in revenues  deferred rent receivable that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
deferred rent receivable in the accompanying balance sheet represents the cumulative difference between rental revenue as recorded on a straight line basis and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the lease terms 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  to what extent the deferred rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review deferred rent receivable on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of deferred rent with respect to any given tenant is in doubt  we would record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the specific rent receivable  which would have an adverse effect on our net income for the year in which the reserve is increased or the direct write off is recorded and would decrease our total assets and stockholders equity 
management considers its loans and other lending investments to be held for investment 
we reflect held for investment investments at amortized cost less allowance for loan losses  acquisition premiums or discounts  deferred loan fees and undisbursed loan funds 
on occasion  we may acquire loans at small premiums or discounts based on the credit characteristics of such loans 
these premiums or discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the lives of the related loans 
loan origination or exit fees  as well as direct loan origination costs  are also deferred and recognized over the lives of the related loans as yield adjustments 
if loans with premiums  discounts  loan origination or exit fees are prepaid  we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase in the prepayment gain or loss 
interest income is recognized using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis 
prepayment penalties or yield maintenance payments from borrowers are recognized as additional income when received 
purchase price allocation we record above market and below market in place lease values for owned properties based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize the capitalized above market lease values as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we amortize the capitalized below market lease values presented in the accompanying balance sheet as value of assumed lease obligations as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
since our strategy to a large degree involves sale leaseback transactions with newly originated leases at market rates  the above market and below market in place lease values are generally not significant 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations  the total amount of other intangible assets acquired are further allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from six to eighteen months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which generally range from five to twenty years 
the value of customer relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
investments in real estate we record investments in real estate at cost and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
we expense costs of repairs and maintenance as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because  if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate  we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that the operations related to properties that have been sold or that we intend to sell be presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented  and properties we intend to sell be designated as held for sale on our balance sheet 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
provision for loan losses our accounting policies require that we reflect in our financial statements an allowance for estimated credit losses with respect to mortgage loans we have made based upon our evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with our private lending assets 
we have extended one mortgage loan and have not experienced any actual losses in connection with our lending investments 
management reflects provisions for loan losses on a portfolio basis based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying our investments 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
accounting for derivative financial investments and hedging activities we will account for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  using sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  will be considered cash flow hedges 
we will formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
we will periodically review the effectiveness of each hedging transaction  which involves estimating future cash flows 
cash flow hedges will be accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
amounts will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  will be considered fair value hedges under sfas no 
as of december   we were not a party to any separate derivatives contract 
certain of our leases and loans contain embedded derivatives  principally libor floors  which do not require separate accounting 
income taxes our financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have operated and will operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit and  as a result  we do not expect to pay substantial corporate level income taxes 
many of the requirements for reit qualification  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distributions to our stockholders 
stock based compensation we currently apply the intrinsic value method to account for the issuance of stock options under our equity incentive plan in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  where appropriate 
in this regard  the substantial portion of these options were granted to individuals who are our officers and who qualify as leased employees under fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
accordingly  because the grants were at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the stock at date of grant  we did not record any expense related to the issuance of these options under the intrinsic value method 
we will adopt sfas no 
r  share based payment effective july   which will require us to begin expensing stock options as compensation cost 
dependent upon the method chosen by our management for implementation of sfas no 
r  prior periods may need to be adjusted 
results of operations for the period from february  inception to december  results of operations for the period from february  inception to december  are not comparative because operations had only recently begun and there was minimal activity during this period 
for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   we earned  of rental revenue  representing twelve months of rent from our raleigh  north carolina property  eleven months of rent from our canton  ohio property  eight months of rent from our akron  ohio property  six months of rent from both our charlotte and canton  north carolina properties  five months of rent from our lexington  north carolina and snyder township  pennsylvania properties  approximately four months of rent from our austin  texas property  and approximately three months of rent from our norfolk  virginia  mt 
pocono  pennsylvania  granby  quebec  and montreal  quebec properties 
we recorded interest income of  for the year ended december   which represents months of interest income on the mortgage loan that we extended for the purchase of a sterling heights  michigan commercial property 
expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  were  operating expenses mainly consist of the management advisory fee  depreciation and amortization  insurance  professional fees and general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   the management advisory fee was  the management advisory fee consists of the reimbursement of expenses  including direct allocation of employee salaries and benefits  as well as general overhead expense  to our adviser in accordance with the terms of the advisory agreement 
depreciation and amortization expenses of  were recorded for the year ended december  insurance expense was  and professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees  were  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  and consisted mainly of directors fees and stockholder related expenses 
because we have only recently begun our operations  we do not believe that our current level of operating expenses relative to revenues is indicative of our operating expenses in the future 
as we continue to expand our real estate investments  we expect our revenues and operating expenses to increase and that ultimately our annual management advisory fee will be approximately of our invested assets 
interest income during the year ended december   we earned interest income on cash and cash equivalents of  this interest represents the interest earned on the investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in short term investment grade securities  primarily us treasury bills 
as we increase our portfolio of investments in real estate and mortgage loans with cash on hand  we anticipate that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents will decrease 
during the year ended december   we earned interest income on employee loans of  this interest represents the interest earned on a loan extended to an employee in september of in connection with the exercise of stock options 
this loan was granted at an interest rate of  which was approved as a fair market rate by our board of directors 
net income for the year ended december   we recorded net income of  based on the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   the basic and diluted earnings per weighted average common share were both 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents available to make investments and fund our continuing operations  a decrease of million from million at december  the funds on hand were predominantly raised though our initial public offering in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  consisting primarily of net income  increases in rent received in advance and security deposits and an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in amounts due our adviser  increases in mortgage interest receivable  increases in deferred rent receivable and an increase in other assets 
net cash used in operating activities during the period february  inception through december  was  consisting primarily of the a net loss and an increase in prepaid expenses  partially offset by and increase in amounts due our adviser 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million  which consisted of our purchases of the canton  ohio commercial office and warehouse property in january  the akron  ohio commercial office and laboratory space in april  the charlotte  north carolina commercial office space in june  the canton  north carolina commercial warehouse and manufacturing property in july  the lexington  north carolina and snyder township  pennsylvania properties purchased in august of  the austin  texas flexible office space in september  the norfolk  virginia  mt 
pocono  pennsylvania  granby  quebec  and montreal  quebec commercial manufacturing buildings in october  and our extension of a mortgage loan of approximately million on the sterling heights  michigan commercial property in february net cash used in investing activities during the period from inception through december  was million  consisting of the purchase of the raleigh  north carolina commercial office property in december financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
these amounts consisted primarily of the dividend payments to our stockholders 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the period from inception through december  and consisted of the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the initial issuance of common stock from our founder in connection with our formation 
future capital needs we had a purchase commitment for a single property at december  in the aggregate amount of million  where a deposit had been placed on the real estate as of december  this purchase closed on february  on february   we also purchased another property  from a different seller  for a total purchase price of million  utilizing available cash on hand 
as of march   we have invested approximately million  or  of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in real properties and mortgage loans 
investments in fourteen real properties account for approximately million of the currently invested net proceeds  and an investment in one mortgage loan accounts for approximately million of the currently invested net proceeds 
during the remainder of and beyond  we expect to complete additional acquisitions of real estate and to extend additional mortgage notes 
we expect to finance these activities as we have in the past  using the remaining funds on hand raised through our initial public offering in however  once the net proceeds of our initial public offering have been substantially invested  we intend to acquire additional properties by borrowing all or a portion of the purchase price and collateralizing the loan with mortgages secured by some or all of our real property  or by borrowing against our existing line of credit 
if we were unable to make any required debt payments on any borrowings we make in the future  our lenders could foreclose on the properties collateralizing their loans  which could cause us to lose part or all of our investments in such properties 
we also may issue additional equity securities in the future to finance future investment although there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on favorable terms if at all 
line of credit on february  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by branch banking trust company  which provides us with up to million of financing 
the line of credit matures on february  we have the option of increasing the line of credit up to an additional million  for a total of million  upon agreement of the syndicate of banks 
the interest rate charged on the advances under the facility is based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and adjusts periodically 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a fee of per year 
our ability to access this funding source is subject to our continuing to meet customary lending requirements such as compliance with financial and operating covenants and meeting certain lending limits 
for example  as is customary with such line of credit facilities  the maximum amount we may draw under this agreement is based on the percentage of the value of our properties meeting agreed upon eligibility standards that we have pledged as collateral to the banks 
as we arrange for long term mortgages for these properties  the banks will release the properties from the line of credit and reduce the availability under the line of credit by the advanced amount of the removed property 
conversely  as we purchase new properties meeting the eligibility standards  we may pledge these new properties to obtain additional advances under this agreement 
based on our completion of the documentation of the initial collateral pools in accordance with the banks eligibility criteria  as of march   we may draw up to million under this agreement 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period more than contractual obligations total less than year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total this does not include the portion of the operating lease on office space  which is currently on a month to month basis  that is allocated to us by our adviser in connection with our advisory agreement 
the purchase obligations reflected in the above table represents committiments outstanding at december  to purchase real estate  which were subsequently closed in february funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed funds from operations ffo  as a relative non gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo  as defined by nareit  is net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income loss and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
comparison of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
diluted funds from operations per share diluted ffo per share is ffo divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis during a period 
we believe that ffo and diluted ffo per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for evaluating our ffo results in the same manner that investors use net income and earnings per share eps in evaluating net income available to common shareholders 
in addition  since most reits provide ffo and diluted ffo per share information to the investment community  we believe ffo and diluted ffo per share is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other reits 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo and that diluted eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to diluted ffo per share 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our ffo for the year ended december  and for the period from february  inception through december  to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income  and a computation of diluted ffo per weighed average common share and diluted net income per weighted average common share

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
we currently have one variable rate loan and certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates 
we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable 
we are also exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the holding of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  interest bearing investments 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase in the one month libor rate by would increase our net income by approximately  or over the next twelve months  compared to net income for the year ended december  a hypothetical decrease in the one month libor by would have no impact on our net income over the next twelve months  due to the existing minimum interest rates in place on the loans and in our leases 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan and lease portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our short term line of credit or long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have purchased two properties in canada  and the monthly rental payments on these properties are received in canadian dollars 
in order to mitigate the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations  we are currently exploring the possibility of securing one or more loans on the real estate properties in which the mortgage payments would be denominated in canadian dollars 
until one or more loans has been secured on the properties  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  exchange rate movements to date have not had a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
for the year ended december   we had no foreign currency transaction gains or losses in connection with the translation of monthly rental payments denominated in a foreign currency 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
