item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report 
overview qmed r  inc was incorporated in new jersey in and reincorporated in delaware in interactive heart management corp 
ihmc r is a wholly owned subsidiary of qmed  which was incorporated in ihmc developed and often co markets with qmed health care information and communication services to health plans  governments and private companies 
the services of qmed include ohms cvd r online health management system for cardiovascular disease which is an integrated cardiovascular disease management system 
ohms cvd includes related systems to assist health plans  government organizations and employer groups in managing the care  and cost of diabetes  cardiovascular conditions  including coronary artery disease cad  stroke  heart failure chf  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes 
these systems are designed to aid health care physicians in the optimal use of evidence based medical management for patients with these conditions including co morbidities  as well as those at high risk of developing these conditions 
the net impact of this approach is the improvement in health and the associated reduction in mortality  morbidity and cost 
as of november   we had contracts to provide these services to two medicare demonstration projects and licensed health plans in states covering approximately million health plan members 
our disease management program is for members identified with chronic disease conditions as well as being at high risk for significant and costly episodes of care 
the program is supported by technology that is designed to deliver the best clinical and financial outcomes to our customers 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which are based upon current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in order for us to utilize the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  investors are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors  among others  set forth below  and consequently  actual operations and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
the important factors include o our ability to renew and or maintain contracts with our customers under existing terms or restructure these contracts on terms that would not have a material negative impact on our results of operations  o our ability to execute new contracts for health plan disease management services  o the risks associated with a significant concentration of our revenues with a limited number of health plan customers  o the timing and costs of implementation  and the effect  of regulatory rules and interpretations relating to the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act  o our ability to effect estimated cost savings and clinical outcome improvements under health plan disease management contracts and reach mutual agreement with customers with respect to cost savings  or to effect such savings and improvements within the timeframes contemplated by us  o the ability of our health plan customers to provide timely  complete and accurate data that is essential to the operation and measurement of our performance under the terms of our health plan contracts and our accurate analysis of such data  o our ability to resolve favorably contract billing and interpretation issues with our health plan customers  o our ability to effectively integrate new technologies into our care management information technology platform  o our ability to obtain adequate financing to provide the capital that may be needed to support the growth of our health plan operations and financing or insurance to support our performance under new health plan contracts  o unusual and unforeseen patterns of healthcare utilization by individuals within the health plans with chronic conditions  including coronary artery disease cad  stroke  heart failure hf  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes with which we have executed disease management contracts  o the impact of the introduction of new technologies  o the ability of the health plans to maintain the number of covered lives enrolled in the plans during the terms of the agreements between the health plans and us  o our ability to attract and or retain and effectively manage the employees required to implement our agreements with health plan organizations  o the impact of future state and federal healthcare legislation and regulations on our ability to deliver services  o the financial health of our customers and their willingness to purchase our services  o the impact of litigation or arbitration  o our ability to accurately estimate our performance and revenue recognition under the terms of our contracts  o our ability to develop new products and deliver outcomes on those products  o our ability to implement our strategy within expected cost estimates  o general economic conditions we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended november  the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we enter into contractual arrangements with health plans and government agencies to provide disease management services 
fees under our health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
the pmpm rates usually differ between contracts due to the various types of health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare advantage 
these contracts are generally for terms of one to three years with provisions for subsequent renewal  and typically provide that all or a portion of our fees may be performance based 
performance based contracts have varying degrees of risk associated with our ability to deliver the guaranteed financial cost savings 
in most cases we guarantee a percentage reduction of disease costs compared to a prior baseline year determined by actuarial analysis and other estimates used as a basis to measure performance objectives 
the measurement of our performance against the base year information is a data intensive and time consuming process that is typically not completed until six to eight months after the end of the contract year 
we bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due based on previous months membership  which always includes the amount  if any  that may be subject to refund for retroactive member terminations and a shortfall in performance 
we adjust or defer revenue for contracts where we believe performance is short of contractual obligations  possibly resulting in a refund of fees or where fees generated may be subject to further retroactive adjustment associated with a contract or plan s decision to completely terminate its coverage in a geographic market as well as general membership changes 
for example  general terminations can be due to death  member change of health plan  etc 
we recognize revenue  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
 as follows we recognize the fixed portion of our monthly fee as revenue during the period we perform the services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on indicators of performance to date in the contract year  and we recognize previously recorded deferred revenue upon final settlement of the contract measurement year 
adjustments for shortfalls in performance targets under the terms of the contract or other factors affecting revenue recognition are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are provided and are adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
we assess our estimates by analyzing various information including but not limited to  medical claims data  prior performance under the contract and review of physician and patient participation levels 
we review these estimates periodically and make adjustments  as interim information is available 
we determine our level of performance at interim periods based on medical claims data  achievement of physician and patients participation levels or other data supplied by the health plan 
in the event these interim performance measures indicate that performance targets are not being met or sufficient data is unavailable  fees  which could be subject to refund  are not recorded as revenue but rather are recorded as a current liability entitled contract billings in excess of revenues 
under performance based arrangements  the ability to make estimates at interim periods can be challenging due to the inherent nature of the medical claims process and the lag time associated with it 
in most cases  complete paid claims data is not available until up to six months after claims are incurred 
although interim data measurements are indicative of performance objectives  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the settlement process under a contract  which includes the settlement of any performance based fees and involves reconciliation of health care claims and clinical data  is generally not completed until sometime after the end of the contract year 
data reconciliation differences between the company and the customer can arise due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions and or data discrepancies  for which the company negotiates with the plan until agreement is reached with respect to identified issues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from three health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from four health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from two health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax expense provision 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered 
the company assesses the likelihood of our deferred tax assets being recovered from future taxable income 
the company then provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which the company does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
any decrease in the valuation allowance could have a material impact on net income in the period in which such determination is made 
health plan contracts most of our revenues in fiscal through were generated from programs designed to assist health plans in improving the quality of care for health plan members with diseases such as diabetes  coronary artery disease  stroke  heart failure  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes 
these programs are designed to improve care and to reduce healthcare costs 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our future revenue growth will continue to result from providing disease management services to health plans 
we also believe that a greater portion of our future revenue will be from contracts with cms 
we first introduced a coronary artery disease program with a medical group in since that time  we added diabetes  heart failure  stroke  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes to our program 
during fiscal  we were awarded a medicare coordinated care demonstration project  which is designed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of reimbursing disease management services in the medicare fee for service model 
enrollment of patients under this program began in fiscal during fiscal  we received an accreditation by the national committee on quality assurance 
in october  we  together with two other entities  were selected to participate in a disease management program for the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
the program commenced in january of our disease management services include the stratification of high risk patients  contact with their primary care physicians  review of patient chart information  contact and assessment with the patient and coordination of care with the primary care physician 
fees under our health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
the pmpm rates usually differ between contracts due to the various types of health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare 
these contracts are generally for terms of one to three years with provisions for subsequent renewal  and typically provide that all or a portion of our fees may be performance based 
we earn performance based fees upon achieving a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs  in addition to clinical and other criteria  compared to a baseline year 
the membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of our health plan customers can result in a cyclical reduction of lives under management  especially during our first quarter 
employers typically make decisions about health insurance carriers at the end of each calendar year 
health plans also assess the types of markets they service as well as the contractual arrangements of medical groups within those markets 
in any event  all of these factors will have an effect on membership as of january of each year 
a health plan s decision to exit markets or non renewal of contracts with their medical groups will result in a loss of covered lives under management as of january although these decisions may also result in a gain of members  the process of identification and enrollment will typically lag by six months or longer 
the result of these cyclical changes has not had a material impact on the company s revenues or results of operations 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from pacificare of california  pacificare of texas  and healthpartners  inc of minnesota  each of which comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from pacificare of california  pacificare of texas  pacificare of oregon  and pacificare of colorado  each of which comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from pacificare of california and regence of oregon  each of which comprised more than of the company s revenues 
our strategy is to develop additional cms contracts including both large scale demonstrations for our full suite of interventions as well as providing other cms demonstrations with our already successful front end enrollment process  add contracts with new health plans to provide disease management services  to further develop and expand our cardiovascular disease management business within existing customers  to add disease states to our platform  and to pursue other opportunities within the healthcare industry 
we anticipate that we will utilize our state of the art medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering disease management services 
we anticipate that significant investments will continue to be made during fiscal in the development of the clinical programs  the associated information technology support for these expanded initiatives  and that many of these investments will be made prior to the initiation of revenues from contracts 
it is also anticipated that some of these new capabilities and technologies may be added through strategic alliances with other entities 
we anticipate that additional disease management contracts that we may sign with health plans and governmental agencies may take one of several forms  including per member per month payments to us  some form of shared savings of overall enrollee healthcare costs  fee for services for enrolled members  or some combination of these arrangements 
we anticipate that under most contracts  some portion of our fees will be at risk and subject to our performance against financial cost savings and clinical improvements 
when appropriate we will defer a portion of this revenue 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

the direct costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue once a marketplace and contract matures with a significant number of members being enrolled 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased approximately  or compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to costs associated with compliance with the provisions under the sarbanes oxley act of approximately  costs associated with negotiating and signing new disease management services contracts of approximately  and an increase in both executive and administrative staff of approximately  these increases were partially offset by the reduction of costs associated with the end of a lease on old corporate office space of approximately  and a reduction in insurance costs of approximately research and development expenses for fiscal were flat compared to fiscal we continue to focus our efforts on the development of new  advanced software programs to assist in the identification and evaluation of patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  and security and information technology 
certain costs associated with the development of new product software to be incorporated into our disease management programs are capitalized and amortized over a year useful life 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of the ohms cvd system

our effective tax rate for fiscal is a negative 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets and the sale of certain state tax benefits 
current period income tax expense of  represents minimum state tax liabilities 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal increased approximately  or over fiscal this increase consists of approximately million of additional revenue related to expansion of existing contracts and a new contract entered into during fiscal this increase was offset by a reduction of revenue of approximately million related to market exits under an existing disease management program in california and the termination of disease management programs under heartmasters agreements with regence of oregon and washington  and approximately million related to a difference in estimated versus actual cost savings measures under a contract with a customer 
gross profit margins for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal this decrease was due to the increased costs associated with our expansion into new market places related to new contracts and the difference in estimated verses actual cost savings measures under a contract with a customer described above

the direct costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue once a marketplace and contract matures with a significant number of members being enrolled 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased approximately  or compared to fiscal the increase was included costs associated with a retroactive insurance premium of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding this insurance premium  increased approximately  or compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in both executive and administrative staff  professional fees related to general corporate matters and office rent and depreciation associated with new office furniture and equipment at our new headquarters in eatontown 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased approximately  or compared to fiscal during the past year we have continued to focus our efforts on the development of new  advanced software programs to help us better identify  locate and evaluate patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  and security and information technology 
certain costs associated with the development of new product software are capitalized and amortized over a year useful life 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of the ohms cvd system 
the company incurred a litigation settlement expense of  in and no expense in litigation settlements represent costs associated with settlement of certain outstanding legal proceedings  which have either reached settlement during the period or have reached a point at which the outcome can be reasonably estimated 
loss on operations of joint venture for fiscal increased to approximately  from  in in  this loss was generated primarily from legal fees associated the arbitration between regence of washington and oregon and heartmasters llc 
our effective tax rate for fiscal is a negative 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets 
current period income tax expense of  represents minimum state tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our principal sources of working capital have been the proceeds from public and private placements of securities 
since our inception  sales of securities  including the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  have generated approximately  less applicable expenses 
we had working capital of approximately million at november  compared to approximately million net of an approximate  reserve related to the settlement with the regence group at november  and ratios of current assets to current liabilities of as of november  and as of november  the working capital increase of approximately  was due to a private placement equity transaction on october   whereby the company sold common stock for approximately million  net of expenses  and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of approximately  this increase was partially offset by a net loss of approximately million and capital expenditures of approximately  in september we entered into a  line of credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association 
the line is collateralized by securities owned by the company and expires on september  outstanding balances under the loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lower of the bank s reference rate minus or libor plus 
as of november  no debt was outstanding and the entire  was available under this credit line 
on december   the company issued shares of the company s common stock in a private placement for approximately million  net of expenses 
had this transaction been completed on november  working capital would have increased to approximately million 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with cash and investments  and availability under our credit line will be sufficient to fund our current level of growth and our existing commitments 
however  to the extent the expansion of our operations requires significant additional resources or certain forms of financial guarantees to assure our performance under the terms of new health plan contracts  we may be required to seek additional financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us 
material commitments the following schedule summarizes our contractual cost obligation as of november  in the periods indicated 
contractual obligations payments due by period after total less than year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations    operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations    additional factors that may affect future results future operating results 
future operating results  which reflect management s current expectations may be impacted by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated herein 
these factors include worldwide economic and political conditions  terrorist s activities  industry specific factors  and governmental agencies 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
as demand for our services has increased in recent periods  our quarterly revenue and operating results have become highly dependent on the timing of contracts signed and programs implemented during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our revenue  research and development costs 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems  and problems with the redesign and implementation of these new systems could interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to enhance our current systems in order to improve our operating efficiency and expand the range of disease management services we offer 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
as part of this effort  we are implementing software applications to manage our business operations 
failure to smoothly and successfully implement this and other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run our business 
in addition  any failure or significant downtime in our new information systems could prevent us from efficiently implementing disease management programs  reconciling cost savings and could harm our business 
if we do not introduce successful new disease management services in a timely manner  our services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
our services are for industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to o properly identify customer needs  o innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  o successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  o differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  o price our services competitively  and o anticipate our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past year  and our attrition rate has dropped  there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including o the retention of key employees  o the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  o the retention of key customers  and o the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits from such transactions  our financial position results and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to curtail operations  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant federal  state and local  health and safety  health information disclosure  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
litigation regarding patents or intellectual property could be costly and time consuming 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share
