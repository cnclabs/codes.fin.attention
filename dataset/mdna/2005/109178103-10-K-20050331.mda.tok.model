onshore texas gulf coast the onshore texas gulf coast region is a high potential  multi pay province that lends itself to d seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity 
in addition  certain sand reservoirs display seismic bright spots  which can be direct hydrocarbon indicators and can result in greatly reduced drilling risk 
however  bright spots are not always reliable as direct hydrocarbon indicators and do not generally assess reservoir productivity 
we believe our established d seismic exploration approach  combined with our exploration staff s extensive experience and accumulated knowledge base in this province  particularly given our recent drilling successes  provides us with significant 
table of contents competitive advantages 
the majority of our onshore texas gulf coast activity is currently concentrated in the vicksburg and frio trends 
over the past three years approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic have been allocated to our onshore texas gulf coast region where we have completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
production from our onshore texas gulf coast province represented of our average daily production in  up from in during  we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of in this province 
ten of these wells were exploratory  nine were developmental and we operated of the wells that we drilled 
during  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic in our onshore texas gulf coast province 
for  we are currently planning to spend approximately million on drilling  land and seismic 
approximately of this will be allocated to land and seismic expenditures with the remaining allocated to the drilling of wells and other development activities 
approximately million of our planned drilling expenditures will be allocated to drill seven exploration wells with an average working interest of and to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  the remaining million of our drilling expenditures will be allocated to drill ten development wells with an average working interest of and other development drilling activities 
within the gulf coast  approximately of our drilling capital expenditures were allocated to the vicksburg trend and were allocated to the frio trend 
in  our development drilling was focused principally in the vicksburg trend in brooks county  texas in our home run  floyd fault block and floyd south fields 
in addition  we significantly increased our working interest and net reserves in the triple crown field with the successful completion of our triple crown north well  the d 
j 
sullivan c our decision to drill the d 
j 
sullivan c late in coincided with the closing of a joint venture with an industry participant  where we were able to increase our working interest from to in acres on the northeast side of our diablo project 
much of our exploratory activity in the vicksburg trend has been driven by other similar joint ventures with our industry participant  which has substantial acreage holdings in the area 
we expect to drill up to eight development wells in the triple crown north joint venture area of the triple crown field over the next several years 
we also expect to drill up to four development wells on acreage adjacent to our triple crown field 
two additional joint ventures with the same industry participant resulted in two unsuccessful wells drilled in the sullivan e was drilled in early as part of a joint venture where we had the opportunity to earn an interest in  acres in an untested fault block on the southeast side of our diablo project 
the d 
j 
sullivan a was drilled in late as part of a joint venture where we had the opportunity to earn an interest in approximately  acres on an untested vicksburg structure several miles to the east of our diablo project 
we do not anticipate drilling additional wells as part of either of these two joint ventures at the present time 
however  we continue to have discussions with our industry participant about other exploratory joint venture opportunities in the area  and expect to continue to expand our activities in the trend 
in total  we drilled six vicksburg trend wells during  including two exploratory and four development wells 
for  we currently plan to spend million to drill five development wells in our home run  floyd fault block and triple crown fields  to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  and for other development activities 
we will retain an average working interest of in these development wells 
in the frio trend  we made a new field discovery with the successful completion of our appling deep field discovery well  the sartwelle the sartwelle was a deep frio test in our bayou bengal project 
our bayou bengal project is a square mile d seismic project located primarily in calhoun county  texas that we completed in early we expect to drill up to six development wells in the appling deep field over the next several years 
through year end  we had drilled a total of six wells in our bayou bengal project  with six wells planned for two of these six planned wells will be deep  higher risk and higher reserve potential frio tests similar to the sartwelle as was the case in 
table of contents  in we will continue to actively drill wells in our other existing frio d seismic projects including general patton  millennium and jughole 
we are currently drilling another of our higher risk and higher reserve potential frio tests in our millennium project area which is in the same area in which we discovered our providence field in we retain a working interest in the wyse  which will test the lower frio adjacent to the bcfe rugely field 
furthermore  in we intend to drill exploration wells in two of our recently completed d seismic projects 
the first project  our square mile alamo project  and the second project that began in late and completed in early  our square mile general lee project  are both located in the same geographic region as our bayou bengal project 
we have recently closed on a third new frio d seismic project  encompassing approximately  option acres located along the lower texas gulf coast 
we expect to begin interpreting d seismic data from this project by the second quarter of  and believe that it is likely that we will have additional drilling projects available in this area later in in total  we drilled frio trend wells during  including eight exploratory and five development wells 
for  we have budgeted to spend million to drill six exploration wells with an average working interest of  and five development wells with an average working interest of  to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  and for other development activities 
anadarko basin the anadarko basin is located in northwest oklahoma and the texas panhandle 
we believe this prolific natural gas producing province offers a combination of lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons  as well as higher reserve potential in the deeper sections that have been relatively under explored 
we believe our drilling programs in the anadarko basin and west texas generally provide us with longer life reserves and help to balance our drilling program in the prolific  but generally shorter reserve life  onshore texas gulf coast province 
the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the anadarko basin can provide excellent targets for d seismic imaging 
in addition  drilling economics in the anadarko basin are enhanced by the multi pay nature of many of these prospects  with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as alternatives in the event the primary target zone is not productive 
our recent activity has been focused primarily in the hunton  springer channel and springer bar trends 
however  given the success of several our recent development wells in our hobart granite wash trend in hemphill county  texas  developmental activity in this field could accelerate during the second half of over the past three years approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic have been allocated to our anadarko basin region where we have completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
we also have one exploration well  the mills ranch that began drilling in and is currently in progress 
production from the anadarko basin represented of our average daily production in  up from in during  we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
five of these wells were exploration wells and were developmental 
we operated of the wells that we drilled in the anadarko basin in and are the operator of the mills ranch in total  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic during in our anadarko basin province 
for  we are currently planning to spend approximately million on drilling  land and seismic 
approximately million of this will be allocated to land and seismic expenditures  with the remaining million allocated to the drilling of wells and other development activities 
approximately million of our planned drilling expenditures will be allocated to drill seven exploration wells with an average working interest of and to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  the remaining million of our planned drilling expenditures will be allocated to drill ten development wells with an average working interest of and to other development drilling activities 
furthermore  approximately million of our drilling expenditures budgeted for our anadarko 
table of contents basin province are allocated to the hunton trend  million is allocated to the springer trends and million is allocated to the granite wash trend 
within the anadarko basin  approximately of our capital expenditures were allocated to the hunton trend  to the springer trends and to the granite wash trend 
within our hunton trend  our first development well drilled on the eastern end of the roughly five mile long mills ranch field was the mills ranch s 
in order to minimize drilling cost  the well was a reentry of a previously abandoned arbuckle well 
the well was spud in january and was targeting to drill through both the hunton and arbuckle formations  reaching an estimated total depth of  in the second quarter 
unfortunately in may  after drilling into our primary hunton pay interval  the drill pipe became stuck and the well had to be sidetracked  requiring us to re drill approximately  feet 
the sidetracking operation delayed the completion of the well until september and precluded us from reaching our secondary arbuckle objective 
the well was put on production in late september and initially produced at a gross rate of mmcfe per day 
however  production from the well has declined dramatically and at year end the well was only producing mmcfe per day 
we are currently evaluating what options we have to enhance the performance of the well 
a second mills ranch field well  the mills ranch  was spud in november on the western side of the field where we have completed two prior hunton wells 
this well targets the arbuckle and shallower potential pay intervals and is expected to reach total depth in the second quarter of at present  one additional hunton arbuckle well is scheduled for this well is a high risk and high reserve potential exploration test of another structure in the area 
this well is expected to spud by mid year and is estimated to reach total depth in the fourth quarter of in the texas panhandle of the anadarko basin  we have drilled six recent wells to evaluate the economics of a potentially extensive drilling program in the granite wash formation 
we have approximately  contiguous gross acres in the area 
adjacent acreage has and continues to experience extensive drilling by other operators 
most of this acreage has been developed on acre spacing  although some acreage is being developed on acre spacing 
we are currently evaluating the results of the five most recently drilled granite wash wells  with the last two wells having experienced higher initial producing rates 
we currently have three wells budgeted for the area in the second half of however  should results merit  we may accelerate development of the acreage during the second half of development on acre spacing would require up to potential wells  while development on acre spacing could require as many as potential wells 
west texas west texas is predominantly an oil producing province with generally longer life reserves than that of the onshore texas gulf coast 
our drilling activity in our west texas province has been focused primarily in various carbonate reservoirs  including the canyon reef and fusselman formations of the horseshoe atoll trend  the canyon reef of the eastern shelf  and the mississippian reef of the hardeman basin  at depths ranging from  to  feet 
over the past three years approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic have been allocated to our west texas province where we have completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
production from west texas represented of our average daily production in down from in during we completed one gross well net in two attempts for a completion rate of 
both of these wells were exploration wells and were operated by us 
in total  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic during in our west texas province 
for  we are currently planning to spend approximately million on drilling  land and seismic 
approximately  of this will be allocated to land and seismic expenditures  million will be allocated to drill three exploration wells with an average working interest of and the remainder will be allocated to other development activities 

table of contents given our large inventory of d seismic data in west texas  our strong historical results in the province  and the currently strong oil prices  we have begun to focus more of our resources on exploiting our west texas asset base 
we expect this more intense focus to positively impact our drilling program by late and d seismic exploration we have accumulated d seismic data covering approximately  square miles million acres in over geologic trends in seven basins and seven states 
we typically acquire d seismic data in and around existing producing fields where we can benefit from the imaging of producing analog wells 
these d defined analogs  combined with our experience in drilling wells in our d project areas  provide us with a knowledge base to evaluate other potential geologic trends  d seismic projects within these trends and prospective d delineated drilling locations 
through our experience in the early and mid s  we developed an expertise in the selection of geologic trends that we believe are best suited for d seismic exploration 
in and we invested approximately million in d seismic and land in plays that we believed were providing optimal d delineated drilling economics 
since we have continued to add to our d seismic database within our core trends on a more conservative pace 
we have used the experience that we have gained within our core trends to enhance the quality of subsequent projects in the same trend and other analogous trends  to lower finding and development costs  to compress project cycle times and to enhance our return on capital 
over the last fourteen years we have accumulated substantial experience exploring with d seismic in a wide range of reservoir types and geologic trapping mechanisms 
in addition  we typically acquire digital data bases for integration on our computer aided exploration workstations  including digital land grids  well information  log curves  production information  geologic studies  geologic top data bases and existing d seismic data 
we use our knowledge base  local geological expertise and digital data bases integrated with d seismic data to create maps of producing and potentially productive reservoirs 
as such  we believe our d generated maps are more accurate than previous reservoir maps which generally are based on subsurface geological information and d seismic surveys  enabling us to more precisely evaluate recoverable reserves and the economic feasibility of projects and drilling locations 
historically  we have acquired most of our raw d seismic data using seismic acquisition vendors on either a proprietary basis or through alliances affording the alliance members the exclusive right to interpret and use data for extended periods of time 
in addition  we have participated in non proprietary group shoots of d seismic data commonly referred to as spec data when we believe the expected full cycle project economics were justified  and we have exchanged certain interests in some of our non core proprietary seismic data to gain access to additional d seismic data 
in most of our proprietary d data acquisitions and alliances  we have selected the sites of projects  primarily guided by our knowledge and experience in the core provinces we explore  established and monitored the seismic parameters of each project for which data was shot  and typically selected the equipment that was used 
combining our geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  we manage the majority of our projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  we manage the negotiation and drafting of virtually all of our geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because we generate most of our projects  we can often control the size of the working interest that we retain as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 
consistent with our business strategy  we have increased the working interest we retain in our projects  based upon capital availability and perceived risk 
our average working interest in our d seismic projects acquired during  and was  and  respectively 
the d seismic we acquired during   and was primarily through the exchange of certain rights in some of our non core d seismic projects 
most of these exchanges did not include an industry participant  therefore we retained potentially all interest in any prospects generated from the newly acquired d seismic data 

table of contents in early  we acquired approximately square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our general patton project located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in this project to an industry participant on a promoted basis and thus retained a working interest in the project 
in and early  we acquired approximately square miles of non proprietary and square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our bayou bengal project  also located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in bayou bengal to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
during  we acquired approximately square miles of non proprietary and square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our alamo project located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in alamo to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest in the project 
in late and early  we acquired approximately square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our general lee project  also located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in general lee to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest

table of contents oil and natural gas reserves our estimated total net proved reserves of oil and natural gas as of december   and  pre tax pv value  standardized measure and the estimated future development cost attributable to these reserves as of those dates were as follows 
at december  estimated net proved reserves oil mbbls natural gas mmcf natural gas equivalent mmcfe proved developed reserves as a percentage of net proved reserves pre tax pv in millions standardized measure in millions estimated future development cost in millions base price used to calculate reserves a natural gas per mmbtu oil per bbl a these base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well by well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate our reserves at these dates 
the reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc  our independent petroleum consultants  and are part of reports on our oil and natural gas properties prepared by cawley  gillespie 
we do not report reserve information to any other government agency 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the securities and exchange commission  estimates of our net proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
estimated quantities of net proved reserves and future net revenues there from are affected by oil and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve data set forth in the cawley  gillespie report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers  including those used by us  may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and other factors 
the revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
our estimated net proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal agency 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows 
estimates with respect to net proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial

table of contents item legal proceedings we are  from time to time  party to certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not expect these matters to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on november   we filed a lawsuit in the district court of travis county  texas  against steve massey company  inc the petition claims massey furnished defective casing to us  which ultimately led to the casing failure of our palmer well and the loss of the palmer as a producing well 
in  the parties agreed in principle to settle the case on terms favorable to us 
we received approximately  as a result of this settlement 
the amount of the settlement reduced capitalized well cost 
in addition  massey relinquished its  counterclaim 
on october   relatives of a contractor s employee filed a wrongful death action against us and three other contractors in the district court of matagorda county  texas in connection with the employee s death at our burkhart r location 
on march   a jury determined that we had no liability in the accidental death of the contractor s employee 
the trial judge  however  granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial 
we expect the new trial to take place in june we believe we have adequate insurance to cover any potential damage award subject to a  deductible 
at this point in time  we cannot predict the outcome of this case 
in september  we filed suit in the district court of matagorda county  texas  against one of our contractors in connection with the drilling of the burkhart r well  claiming that contractor breached its contract with us and negligently performed services on the well 
we believe the contractor s actions damaged us by approximately  the contractor counterclaimed  claiming it is entitled to recover approximately  for services rendered 
in april  the case was settled  resulting in a payment by the contractor to our co participants and us of  in addition  the contractor relinquished its counterclaim against us 
based on the amount of the settlement  the additional costs that were covered by insurance  and the insurer being subrogated to our claim  we did not receive any incremental recovery as a result of the settlement 
prior to drilling  the operator of the stonehocker well disputed our ownership in the well 
in march  a motion to determine election was filed with the oklahoma corporation commission 
in january  an administrative law judge with the oklahoma corporation commission ruled in our favor 
the operator of the stonehocker appealed the ruling and the appellate referee with the oklahoma corporation commission affirmed the original ruling in march the full commission panel reviewed the reports of the referee and the original administrative law judge and affirmed those rulings 
the operator then filed an appeal with the oklahoma supreme court 
in january  the parties settled the dispute 
the operator agreed to recognize our full interest in the stonehocker well  and also agreed to reverse certain charges made under the operating agreements of six additional wells in which we own an interest 
a company that relinquished its ownership interest in the nold s well as a result of a non consent election in the re completion of the well asserted that it did not relinquish its entire interest  but rather became subject only to a percent payout provision 
in november  this company filed a lawsuit in the district court of brazoria county  texas  against us for breach of contract 
if the suit was successful  it could have resulted in a judgment of as much as  in april  we settled the case  agreeing to pay the company  in return for the company s assignment of all its right  title and interest in the unit for the well 
in december  we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the western district of texas against another company and a former employee concerning the defendants misappropriation of our trade secrets and breach of confidentiality obligations 
defendants denied any wrongdoing and asserted a counterclaim against us for alleged tortuous interference with an existing business relationship between the company and its employee 
in april  we settled the case 
the company agreed not to compete 
table of contents against us in a specified area for two years  assigned us a small overriding royalty in three tracts  paid us  and released its counterclaim 
as of december   there are no known environmental or other regulatory matters related to our operations that are reasonably expected to result in a material liability to us 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures
