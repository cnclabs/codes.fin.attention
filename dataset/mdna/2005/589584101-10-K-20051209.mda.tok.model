critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition meridian s revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in 
table of contents handling meridian s products 
management estimates rebate accruals based on historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to these rebate accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
meridian s rebate accruals were  at september  and  at september  life science revenue for contract services may come from standalone arrangements for process development and or optimization work contract research and development services  or multiple deliverable arrangements that include process development work followed by larger scale manufacturing contract manufacturing services 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  using the principles in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
inventories meridian s inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis  except for certain inventories in the viral antigens business for which cost is determined on a last in  first out basis 
meridian establishes reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory writedowns would be required and this would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
changes to inventory reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
for the viral antigens purchase business combination  meridian elected to use last in  first out accounting for inventories for financial reporting purposes 
under last in  first out accounting  the stepped up inventory value will be charged to earnings in periods in which inventory quantities decline below those on hand at the acquisition date 
to date  inventory quantities have remained above levels on hand at the acquisition date 
intangible assets meridian s intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
table of contents by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from the analyses required by sfas no 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
there have been no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
meridian s ability to recover its intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  meridian s provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
meridian prepares estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of meridian s tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
meridian s deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of 
table of contents taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in meridian s foreign subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid in applicable foreign jurisdictions 
from time to time  meridian s tax returns in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
meridian s tax provisions take into consideration the judgmental nature of certain tax positions through the establishment of reserves for differences between the probable tax determinations and the as filed tax positions of certain assets and liabilities 
meridian believes that it has complied with all tax laws and regulations to which it is subject 
to the extent that tax benefits result from the completion of these examinations or the passing of statutes of limitation  they will affect the provision in the period known 
meridian believes that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition  results of operation or cash flows
