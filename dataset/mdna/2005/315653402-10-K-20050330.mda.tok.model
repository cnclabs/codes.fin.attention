item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we deploy  own and operate fiber optic networks designed to provide comprehensive broadband connectivity for data  voice and video transmission to other telecommunications service providers in major metropolitan areas 
we have experienced significant operating losses  net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to continue to experience such losses as we continue to operate our business 
we also have a limited operating history 
consequently  prospective investors have limited operating history and financial data upon which to evaluate our performance 
the telecommunications industry continues to experience a period of uncertainty and rationalization 
many companies in our industry are in financial distress  and some of our largest customers have filed for bankruptcy 
we have been negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that are impacting our industry 
expectations for growth in demand for broadband services have not materialized  resulting in significant excess capacity in existing communications networks 
this excess supply of bandwidth and the intense competition among industry participants has produced substantial pressure on the pricing of our services with decreases of up to in recurring monthly charges 
in addition  customer contracts and services have been cancelled  resulting in a loss of recurring revenues to us 
we are unable to determine the extent to which additional contracts or services that we provide to our customers will be cancelled  and we cannot forecast our ability to replace those cancelled contracts with new contracts 
as a result  our revenues  business operations and liquidity may continue to be negatively affected by the market environment 
factors affecting future operations revenues 
we generate revenues from selling network capacity and related services to other communications service providers 
revenues are derived from three general types of services on net transport services 
our transport services include the offering of broadband circuits on our metropolitan transport networks and fibernet in building networks fins 
over our metropolitan transport networks  we can provision circuits from one of our carrier point facilities to another carrier point facility or to an on net building via an interconnection with our fin in that building 
we can also provision circuits vertically between floors in a carrier point facility or an on net building 
off net transport services 
we provide our customers with circuits on networks that we do not own 
we sell this connectivity to our customers by purchasing the underlying circuits from other wholesale telecommunications carriers 
colocation services 
our colocation services include providing customers with the ability to locate their communications and networking equipment at our carrier point facilities in a secure technical operating environment 
we can also provide our customers with colocation services in the central equipment rooms of certain of our on net and off net buildings 
typically  if a customer colocates its equipment at our facilities  our agreement with them also permits them to use our transport services 

table of contents communications access management services 
our access management services include providing our customers with the non exclusive right to market and provide their retail services to tenants in our on net and off net buildings 
customers typically enter into an agreement with us to gain access to all or a significant number of our properties 
for certain of our on net and off net buildings  we have the exclusive right to manage communications access 
once a customer has entered into an agreement with us for access services  we typically require that customer to utilize our in building networking infrastructure for connectivity to its retail customers  if such networking infrastructure is available 
our revenues are generated on a non recurring and monthly recurring basis under contracts with our customers 
the terms of these contracts can range from month to month to fifteen years in length 
throughout  we continued to experience a trend of entering into shorter term contracts with our customers 
our customers typically elect to purchase services on a month to month basis or for a contracted period of one year 
our revenues are generated in the united states of america 
our services are typically sold under fixed price agreements 
in the case of transport services  we provide an optical circuit or other means of connectivity for a fixed price 
revenues from transport services are not dependent on customer usage or the distance between the origination point and termination point of a circuit 
the pricing of colocation services is based upon the size of the colocation space or the number of colocation units  such as cabinets  provided to the customer 
revenues from access management services are typically determined by the square footage of the commercial office properties to which a customer purchases access 
the pricing of all of our services have declined over the past year  with transport services experiencing the greatest decreases 
we expect our operating results to continue to be impacted by decreases in the prices of our services 
the growth of our revenues is dependent upon our ability to provide additional services in our existing facilities 
we also believe that the majority of the growth in our revenues will come from our existing customers 
consequently  our growth in revenues is dependent on the underlying growth of our customers businesses and their need for our services within the facilities that we already operate 
we continue to add additional customers  particularly domestic subsidiaries of internationally based carriers 
however  we believe the number of companies that are potential customers is decreasing  due to the industry rationalization 
in addition  we currently do not anticipate expanding our network infrastructure to other carrier point facilities or on net buildings and off net buildings 
within each of our existing facilities  our revenues will depend upon the demand for our services  the competition that we face and our customer service 
we typically begin our sales cycle by entering into a master services agreement 
this document outlines the operating specifications and commercial standards that are required of us by the customer 
customers can order a specific circuit or colocation space  or  alternatively  they can purchase general availability on our networks or in our facilities on a recurring basis 
during the past year  customers have primarily purchased services from us only on an as needed basis  when their networks requirements mandate an immediate need for additional services 
they have not elected to purchase general availability on our networks  nor have they purchased services on a speculative basis 
we have also experienced significant disconnections of services  as customers groom their networks to eliminate excess capacity 
this loss of revenues has had a significantly negative impact on our financial results and may continue 
currently our colocation and access services produce less than one third of our revenues 
in the future we anticipate generating significantly more of our revenues from transport services than from colocation or access management services 
the scalability of our network architecture allows us to increase transport capacity to a greater degree than is possible with our colocation and access services 
our transport services have been negatively impacted by customers disconnecting higher bandwidth circuits they are purchasing from us and replacing them with lower bandwidth circuits to more efficiently manage the 
table of contents access costs of their networks 
the new transport services that we are providing typically are for lower bandwidth circuits  as our customers expand their network connections on a more limited basis 
the growth in transport revenues that we have experienced on a quarterly basis in and is a result of an increase in the number of circuits we have provisioned  offsetting our disconnections and price declines 
our network solutions services provides our customers with circuits on networks that we do not own 
we purchase circuits from other wholesale telecommunications carriers and sell this connectivity to our customers 
we offer network solutions services in markets that we currently serve  other metropolitan markets that we do not serve with our own networks  and on a long haul basis to connect metropolitan areas 
our colocation services have not experienced the same level of disconnections and price declines as our transport services 
the physical constraints of available colocation space in our facilities and our competitors facilities have limited the supply imbalance that has developed in the connectivity market 
in addition  unlike the fluctuations in demand for bandwidth based upon end user usage  demand for colocation space is more stable because of the consistent need for a location to locate networking equipment 
as a result  prices for colocation have not decreased as much as those of bandwidth  and carriers are less likely to terminate colocation contracts 
contrarily  the growth prospects of our colocation services are not as great as those of our transport services  as we are limited in the amount of colocation space that we can sell without making a significant investment in an additional colocation facility 
our ability to expand the capacity of our transport networks is much greater due to technological advancements in more efficient usage of fiber optics  such as dense wave division multiplexing or dwdm 
our access management services business has been steadily declining  and we expect it to continue to decline 
the revenues that we are generating from this type of service are from long term contracts entered into in prior years 
we do not expect to sign any new contracts for access management in the near future 
the remaining terms of our existing access management service contracts range from a month to month basis to expiration in cost of services 
cost of services is associated with the operation of our networks and facilities 
the largest component of our cost of services is the occupancy expenses at our carrier point facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
these occupancy expenses primarily represent rent expense under direct leases with landlords 
they also include charges for colocation space in other carriers facilities and cross connection fees to interconnect our networks with other carriers networks 
other specific cost of services include maintenance and repair costs  utility costs and license fees 
our license agreements for our on net and off net buildings require us to pay license fees to the owners of these properties 
in addition  our leases at hudson street in new york city also require us to pay license fees 
these license fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the revenues that we generate in each particular building 
our cost of services also include the charges that we incur by purchasing connectivity from other wholesale telecommunications carriers to provide our customers with transport services that are not on our networks 
as we provide additional  off net transport services  we will purchase more connectivity from other carriers 
other than our license fees and off net connectivity charges  our cost of services is generally fixed in nature 
with the exception of off net transport  we do not anticipate that cost of services will change commensurately with any change in our revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally include all of our personnel costs  occupancy costs for our corporate offices  insurance costs  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
personnel costs  including wages  benefits and sales commissions  are our largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
all of our personnel costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not allocate any personnel cost relating to networks operations or sales activities to cost of services 
we have employees as of december  compared to as of december  prospectively  we believe that our personnel costs will increase moderately 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses  represent the second largest component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
these fees  which primarily are attributed to our 
table of contents required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings and financial statement audits  could increase prospectively due to the enhanced regulations regarding corporate governance and compliance matters 
other costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as insurance costs  may increase due to changes in the economic environment and telecommunications industry 
stock related expense 
stock related expense relates to the granting of stock options and restricted stock to our employees 
we make equity grants to our employees in order to attract  retain and incentivize qualified personnel 
these costs are non cash charges that are amortized over the vesting term of each employee s equity agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of our network equipment and infrastructure  computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements  as well as the amortization of certain deferred charges 
we commence the depreciation of network related fixed assets when they are placed into service and depreciate those assets over periods ranging from three to years 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results from operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  an allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when earned as services are provided throughout the life of each sales order with a customer 
the majority of our revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under sales orders that are typically one year in length 
certain of our contracts require us to invoice our customers for the periods ranging from one year to the full term of the contract 
we record deferred revenue for the amount of an invoice that has not been recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue is recorded for the full value of the contract at contract inception  only if we are contractually entitled to invoice the customer for the full value of the contract and the customer had paid such invoice 
we have one reciprocal agreement  whereby we purchase services from one of our customers under a single agreement 
at the beginning of  we had two such reciprocal agreements  but one was terminated during the services provided and obtained through these agreements were priced at fair value as of the date of the agreement 
we recognized the transport and colocation revenues from these agreements in accordance with our stated revenue recognition policy  and we concurrently recorded the expenses for colocation services as cost of services in our statements of operations 
none of the expenses associated with our reciprocal agreements are capitalized 
all of the costs are expensed as incurred 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in and million of our cost of services 
for the year ended december   we had one reciprocal agreement which accounted for million  or  of revenues and million of our cost of services 
for the year ended december   we had one reciprocal agreement which accounted for million  or  of revenues and million of our cost of services 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant number of our customers have filed for bankruptcy or are otherwise in significant financial distress 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment or telecommunications industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the telecommunications industry and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during  the economic environment and the telecommunications industry  in particular  did not rebound as expected 
the dramatic change in the operating environment for our industry over the past few years resulted in significantly less demand and lower prices for our services than we had expected  and we also determined that the recovery in demand and pricing that we anticipated would not occur in the near term 
although we concluded that the prospects for the industry  and our business in particular  were not worse than we had forecasted in  we once again revised our forecasts for revenues at certain facilities  as we concluded that they would not be achieved 
in conjunction with our reassessment of certain revenue forecasts  we revised our business plan and conducted reviews of our assets and operations 
the revisions to the business plan primarily included further reductions in forecasts of revenues and capital expenditures 
the projected amounts of certain cost of services and overhead expenses were reduced as well to reflect the decrease in our expected business activity  although not commensurately with revenues and capital expenditures 
we used an undiscounted forecasted cash flow model to determine if there was an impairment based on the cash flows expected to be generated from the assets related to these facilities  and used a discounted cash flow model to measure the impairment 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an asset impairment of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
during  we settled a dispute with a dark fiber provider that had filed for bankruptcy  which resulted in the impairment of previously purchased dark fiber miles 
we agreed to concede our claim to unutilized dark fiber miles  or of the total dark fiber acquired from this provider in december for million 
we also agreed to pay  to settle a trade payable dispute with this provider  for which we had accrued million as a liability 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million due to the write off of million of dark fiber included in network infrastructure  million of related accumulated depreciation and a million reduction in accrued liabilities from this settlement for charges for network infrastructure that were previously capitalized and impaired 

table of contents during  we did not renew two of our off net property leases 
as a result  we abandoned the assets associated with these two properties 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million due to the write off of million of network infrastructure and million of related accumulated depreciation 
during and  we recovered approximately million and million  respectively  from the sale of assets previously written off as impaired 
the proceeds were recorded as a recovery of impairments previously recorded 
impairment of goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to june  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability 
any write down of goodwill would be charged as a cumulative change in accounting principle upon adoption of the new accounting standard if the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles exceeds its fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we considered then current information  including an analysis of our market value as a result of our recapitalization  and determined that there is no additional impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and determined that we did have an impairment of goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million to eliminate our remaining goodwill 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the operating assets of gateway 
realty 
new jersey 
llc  also known as gateway colocation  and we recorded million in goodwill as a result of this transaction 
in june  our settlement agreement with a dark fiber provider required us to record an impairment to property  plant and equipment 
per sfas no 
 impairment and disposal of long lived assets  this asset impairment required us to perform a test for impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
as such  we performed our test for recoverability of goodwill from the acquisition of gateway colocation  and determined that million of goodwill was impaired 
we recorded a charge to eliminate all of our goodwill 
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  we increased the number of our customers from at the end of to at the end of  with the addition of many domestic subsidiaries of internationally based carriers to our customer base 
we believe that there are greater opportunities to serve domestic subsidiaries of foreign telecommunications companies in our gateway markets  as domestic carriers consolidate and rationalize 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in revenues due to an award from an arbitration proceeding  in which we were the prevailing claimant 
revenues recognized in connection with this award accounted for of revenue for upon confirmation of the award  we recognized this amount as revenue during the year ended december  for services previously provided and earned 
of the total award payment  million related to payment for services previously provided and earned  and we recognized 
table of contents this amount as revenues during the year 
the remaining million was for the reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding 
we have recorded this reimbursement as a reversal of previously accrued expenses included in selling  general and administrative expenses in also in connection with this arbitration award  we recognized an additional million in revenues that were previously deferred 
we did not recognize revenues related to this arbitration proceeding or the disputed contract in prior periods as the collectibility of amounts due under the contract was in doubt 
revenues were generated by providing transport  colocation and communications access management services to our customers 
we recognized million in on net transport service revenues in  up from million in off net transport service revenues for were million  up from million in revenues from colocation and other services increased to million in from million in  and revenues from communications access management services declined to million in from million in the vast majority of our transport and colocation services are provided within and between our carrier point facilities in the new york city market 
transport revenues increased as we provided a greater number of lower bandwidth circuits to our customers  offsetting the disconnections and price decreases that we have been experiencing 
we benefited from growth in transport services from our existing customer base  as well as through the addition of new customers 
prospectively  we expect that the current trends in our transport services will continue 
colocation revenues were generated as we leased additional caged space  cabinets and racks in our facilities to our customers 
since we are approaching capacity at some of our colocation facilities  we may have to invest in expanding these facilities to offer additional space to our customers 
to this end  we have expanded our meet me room facility at hudson street in new york city  and this project was substantially completed at the end of we expect transport services to grow at a faster rate than colocation 
our network infrastructure has significant capacity to provide additional broadband transport connectivity  and our colocation facilities are approaching more stabilized utilization rates 
the decrease in access revenues was due to the severe decline in the market for building centric services and the resulting bankruptcies of many building centric service providers  many of which were our customers 
we do not expect to sell any additional access services  and we believe our existing contracts for access services will not be renewed when they expire 
for fiscal years and  there were no individual customers that accounted for over of our revenues 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in  consistent with million  or  of revenues in cost of services 
cost of services  associated with the operation of our networks and facilities  were million in  compared to million in the majority of our cost of services is occupancy expenses  consisting of rent and utility costs  for our carrier hotel facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
other cost of services includes license fees  maintenance and repair costs and off net connectivity charges 
occupancy expenses represented of cost of services or million in  as compared to or million in license fees were of cost of services in  or million  compared to of cost of services in  or million 
license fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the revenues we generate in the respective facility  as per our lease agreement with the facility  and they are expensed in cost of services as the corresponding services are provided 
on september   we amended our lease agreements for our facilities at hudson street in new york city 
the amendments include a reduction in the license fee  and an increase in the total annual rent amount from million to million 
we expect the effect of these amendments will be a reduction in future rent expense at these facilities  as the reduction in the license fee percentage should offset the increase in base rent 
maintenance and repair costs were of cost of services in  compared to of cost of services in  and they will continue to represent a relatively small and fixed component of cost of services 
off net connectivity charges were of cost of services in or million  versus of cost of services in or million 
these charges will increase commensurately with our growth in off net transport services 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for personnel costs represented of selling  general and administrative expenses in and in professional fees were of selling  general and administrative expenses in  compared to in we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in stock related expense 
stock related expense for was million  compared to million for this non cash expense relates to the amortization of restricted stock granted to our employees 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
in  we settled a dispute with a dark fiber provider that had filed for bankruptcy  which resulted in the impairment of previously purchased dark fiber miles 
we agreed to concede our claim to unutilized dark fiber miles  or of the total dark fiber acquired from this provider in december for million 
we also agreed to pay  to settle a trade payable dispute with this provider  for which we had accrued million as a liability 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million due to the write off of million of dark fiber included in network infrastructure  million of related accumulated depreciation and a million reduction in accrued liabilities from this settlement for charges for network infrastructure that were previously capitalized and impaired 
also during the year ended december   we did not renew two of our off net property leases 
as a result  we abandoned the assets associated with these two properties 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million due to the write off of million of network infrastructure and million of related accumulated depreciation 
also during  we recovered million due to the disposition of equipment that was previously impaired 
in  we recorded an asset impairment of million as a result of our revised business plan and forecast of revenues reflecting the continued adverse business environment and industry conditions 
included in this charge in is a recovery of million due to the disposition of equipment that was previously impaired 
we recorded no other reserves  accruals or other liabilities related to these write offs 
impairment of goodwill 
during  our settlement agreement with a dark fiber provider required us to record an impairment to property  plant and equipment 
per sfas no 
 impairment and disposal of long lived assets  this asset impairment required us to perform a test for impairment of goodwill under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as such  we performed our test for the recoverability of goodwill from the acquisition of gateway colocation  and determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a million impairment for the year ended december in  we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million 
this goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our acquisition in of a minority interest in local fiber  llc held by a third party 
sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to december  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability at least on an annual basis 
we recorded this impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million  compared to million for this slight increase is due to the acquisition of gateway colocation and customer specific capital expenses incurred throughout the year 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
we recorded a non cash charge of million related to the partial extinguishment of our credit facility on january  we recorded a loss for the fair value given in excess of the amount of debt extinguished and related pro rata write off of original issue discount and deferred financing charges 
the fair value given in exchange for million in indebtedness was million shares of common stock  the issuance of million warrants with an exercise price of per share and the re pricing of the 
table of contents exercise price of million existing warrants from to per share 
also included in this loss is million in fees associated with the consummation of the recapitalization 
as this extinguishment of debt represented approximately of our outstanding balance  we wrote off the same percentage of deferred financing charges and original issue discount of million and million  respectively  which is also included in our calculation of loss on early extinguishment of debt 
on march   we entered into an agreement to terminate all of our capital lease obligations for a payment of  this termination of our capital lease obligations resulted in a gain on early extinguishments of debt of approximately million  partially offsetting our earlier loss 
we did not have any early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  for interest income is generated on our cash and restricted cash balances which are at variable rates of interest and are invested in short term  highly liquid investments 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment of million of principal on our outstanding debt during the year ended december  all of our indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate  so we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
we anticipate that interest expense will remain consistent with prior periods  as higher interest rates will be off set by our rate reduction from libor basis points to libor basis points on may  net loss applicable to common stockholders 
we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million in compared to a loss of million in the decrease in the net loss applicable to common stockholders is a result of the aforementioned changes in our operations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  we increased the number of our customers from at the end of to at the end of  with the addition of many international carriers to our customer base

table of contents for fiscal year  there were no individual customers that accounted for over of our revenues 
during  two customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in  down from million  or  of revenues in in  we terminated one of our reciprocal agreements leaving only one agreement in place during in july we negotiated a revised pricing structure with a significant customer for the services that we provided to it  although we previously were not obligated to do so 
in addition  this customer subsequently terminated certain services that we were providing 
the impact to revenues attributable to these two events was approximately a and a million reduction in revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impact of these events does not put us in a loss position with respect to the remaining services with this customer 
cost of services 
cost of services  associated with the operation of our networks and facilities  were million in  compared to million in the majority of our cost of services is occupancy expenses  consisting of rent and utility costs  for our carrier hotel facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
other cost of services includes license fees  maintenance and repair costs and off net connectivity charges 
occupancy expenses represented of cost of services in and increased by only over license fees  which were of cost of services in  increased by over from because a greater proportion of our revenues were generated in facilities in which our agreements with the building owners mandate these license fees 
license fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the revenues we generate in the respective facility  as per our lease agreement with the facility  and they are expensed in cost of services as the corresponding services are provided 
we expect license fees to represent an equivalent percentage of cost of services  prospectively 
maintenance and repair costs were of cost of services in  and although these costs decreased by from  they will continue to represent a relatively small and fixed component of cost of services 
off net connectivity charges also were of cost of services in we did not incur these expenses in  as we did not provide this type of transport service 
going forward  these charges will increase commensurately with our growth in off net transport services 
we negotiated certain non recurring concessions from vendors in the amount of million  which reduced cost of services for the year ended december  these items were expensed in prior periods and included in our cost of services 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million of our cost of services for the year ended december  and million for the same period in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for personnel costs represented of selling  general and administrative expenses in and were unchanged from professional fees  which were of selling  general and administrative expenses in  increased by million over due primarily to the legal costs of an arbitration proceeding in which we were the claimant

stock related expense for was million  compared to million for this non cash expense relates to the amortization of stock options granted below fair market value and restricted stock granted to our employees 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
in  we recorded an asset impairment of million as a result of our revised business plan and forecast of revenues reflecting the continued adverse business environment and industry conditions 
included in this charge in is a recovery of million due to the 
table of contents disposition of equipment that was previously impaired 
in  we also recorded an asset impairment of million to reflect our business plan and forecast of revenues at that time 
included in this charge in is a recovery of million due to the disposition of equipment that was previously impaired 
we also recorded a write off of property  plant and equipment of million in april we recorded this write off of capital assets due to the termination of several property leases and license agreements for network facilities 
there was no cost to us to abandon these assets  nor do we expect to receive any proceeds or other consideration from the abandonment of these assets 
we recorded no other reserves  accruals or other liabilities related to these write offs 
impairment of goodwill 
in  we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million 
this goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our acquisition in of a minority interest in local fiber  llc held by a third party 
sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to december  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability at least on an annual basis

we received these proceeds from financing activities primarily in connection with our recapitalization transactions  which occurred in october and january on january   we completed a series of transactions with the lenders under our credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of three debt exchange agreements between us and each of bank one  na  nortel networks inc and td securities usa inc  we issued  shares of our common stock to these lenders at a price of per share  in satisfaction of approximately million of indebtedness  representing all of the outstanding principal indebtedness and accrued interest owing to these lenders under our credit facility 
we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement  dated as of january   with certain investors  pursuant to which we issued to the investors in a private offering an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  for an aggregate cash consideration of million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we also issued warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share with a term of five years 
concurrently with the other transactions occurring on january   the investors also purchased  shares of common stock from the three lenders departing from the credit facility in a privately negotiated transaction for an aggregate cash consideration of million 
in connection with the purchase agreement with the investors  we entered into a registration rights agreement  dated as of january   with the investors  which required us to file a resale registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the registration of all of the shares of common stock issued under the purchase agreement and the shares that the investors purchased from the departing lenders

the share information discussed above and below has been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split 
on june   we executed the loan documentation necessary to establish a subordinated credit facility to provide the funding for the purchase of up to million of our common stock  under a stock repurchase program 
repurchases could have been made from time to time until december  through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block trades or otherwise 
repurchases were subject to the availability of stock  prevailing market conditions  trading price of the stock and our financial performance 
the repurchase program did not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and could have been discontinued or suspended at any time 
any shares repurchased in the program would have been treated as shares of common stock held in treasury 
as of december   there were no outstanding amounts under this subordinated credit facility and no repurchases of common stock had been made 
on december   this subordinated credit facility expired and was not renewed 
on june   we commenced our previously approved exchange offer for certain of our outstanding warrants 
holders of certain of our outstanding warrants were given the opportunity to exchange their currently outstanding warrants for shares of our common stock as if the exercise price of their warrants was per share if such warrants were exercised in full on a cashless basis 
the offer was implemented to  among other things  satisfy certain of our obligations undertaken with respect to our recapitalization transactions  which occurred in october and january the offer expired on august  the warrants issued in connection with the recapitalization transactions that we completed in october and january did not participate in the offer to exchange 
in connection with this offer we exchanged  warrants for  shares of common stock 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the operating assets of gateway 
realty 
new jersey 
llc  also known as gateway colocation 
gateway colocation operates a  square foot communications hub and colocation facility located at halsey street in newark  new jersey 
the transaction was structured as an acquisition of assets  and the purchase price paid at closing consisted of million shares of our common stock with a fair value of million on the closing date and approximately  in cash 
the purchase agreement also includes an earn out payment based upon the achievement of certain financial objectives with respect to the revenues generated by the facility 
more specifically  the earn out payment will be based on the gross revenues  on an annualized basis  for a particular month designated by gateway colocation during the twenty four month period immediately subsequent to closing 
the earn out payment  if payable  will be paid in shares of our common stock 
however  the issuance of such additional shares  in the aggregate with the shares of common stock issued on january   will not exceed of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the closing date without first receiving stockholder approval 
we have agreed to file with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued at closing  and have also agreed to file a registration statement with respect to the resale of shares issued  if any  pursuant to the terms of the earn out provision 
as of december   there were no additional shares required under the earn out provision

also on january   in an unrelated transaction  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with certain investors  pursuant to which we issued to the investors  in a private offering  an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements  we also issued to such investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share with a term of three and one half years 
in 
table of contents connection with the purchase agreements  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors  which required us to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the resale of i the shares of common stock issued to the investors and ii the shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued to the investors 
these shares were included in a registration statement that was declared effective on april  we utilized a portion of the gross proceeds to repay million of term loan indebtedness underlying the credit facility and to cancel million of letters of credit by providing cash securing deposits in lieu thereof 
we also permanently reduced our availability to issue letters of credit by million 
in doing so  we satisfied the mandatory automatic reductions of commitments of the credit facility for  as discussed below 
by canceling the letters of credit  million of restricted cash previously held as cash collateral was made available for general corporate purposes 
furthermore  we repaid million of outstanding revolving loan indebtedness  which is available to be redrawn in the future subject to compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
in connection with the consummation of both the gateway colocation acquisition and equity financing on january   we entered into certain transactions with the lenders under our credit facility 
we executed an eleventh amendment to the credit agreement  pursuant to which  among other things  the lenders consented to the above referenced transactions 
the eleventh amendment also revised the automatic reductions of the commitments underlying the credit facility that are required on a quarterly basis beginning on march  expressed as a percentage of the aggregate outstanding commitments  the automatic reductions were revised to a total of in  in  in and at maturity on march  in addition  the eleventh amendment also incorporated adjustments to the financial covenants of the credit facility 
as a condition to the lenders entering into the eleventh amendment  we agreed to reduce the exercise price of certain previously issued outstanding warrants held by the lenders to purchase approximately  shares of common stock from per share to per share  which were immediately exercised by the lenders 
we compared the value of the warrants prior to repricing with the value of the warrants after the repricing using the black sholes option pricing model and determined that there was no difference in value 
therefore the repricing of warrants had no impact on our consolidated financial statements

we recorded this reimbursement as a reversal of previously accrued expenses included in selling  general and administrative expenses in also in connection with this arbitration award  we recognized an additional million in revenues that were previously deferred 
we did not recognize revenues related to this arbitration proceeding or the disputed contract in prior periods as the collectability of amounts due under the contract was in doubt

cec provides managed network services in the new york metropolitan area 
in order to finance the acquisition of cec described above  on december   we entered into a securities purchase agreement as amended  the investor purchase agreement  with certain investors for the sale of up to million in shares of a newly issued series k convertible preferred stock the series k preferred  and common stock warrants the warrants 
the series k preferred and the warrants are convertible and exercisable at a price of per share of common stock  and may be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances

the compliance levels and calculation of such levels with respect to those covenants are as defined in the credit agreement underlying our credit facility  as amended  which is on file with the securities and exchange commission 
non compliance with any of the covenants  requirements  or other terms and conditions under the credit agreement constitutes an event of default and potentially accelerates the outstanding balance of the credit facility for immediate payment

however  from time to time  we may consider private or public sales of additional equity or debt securities and other financings  depending upon market conditions  in order to provide additional working capital or finance the continued operations of our business  although there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully consummate any such financing on acceptable terms  if at all

certain facts that may affect future results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking 
table of contents statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed below 
as a result  our future operations involve a high degree of risk 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors affecting our business condition in addition to the other information and factors included in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects we are an early stage company  and we expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we did not begin to engage in our current business until and did not begin to offer our services until the first quarter of our limited operating history makes the evaluation of our future prospects very difficult 
we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
as an early stage organization  we are at a competitive disadvantage to larger  more established competitors 
we anticipate that this competitive disadvantage may persist for the foreseeable future 
if we do not successfully address these risks  our business may suffer 
we have and may continue to experience operating losses  net losses and a cash flow deficit 
we may not achieve or sustain operating income  net income or positive cash flow from operations in the future 
since our inception we have incurred operating losses and net losses both on an annual and quarterly basis 
we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur operating losses and net losses in  and we may not for the foreseeable future 
in  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million 
in  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million 
in  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million 
you should also be aware that our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the economic and competitive conditions in the communications and networking industries  any operating difficulties  increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that may adversely affect us  changes in technologies creating alternative services to our services or making our services and networks obsolete  any delays in implementing any strategic projects  and our ability to operate our networks in a reliable and cost effective manner 
the sector in which we operate is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we face competition from many entities with significantly greater financial resources  well established brand names and larger customer bases 
the entities that compete with us include mobile and fixed wireless service providers  local telephone companies  long distance companies  competitive access providers  competitive local exchange carriers and competitive colocation providers 
the numerous companies that compete in our market expose us to severe price competition for our services 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if additional competitors focus on our market opportunity  there may be intensified price competition which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  we may experience an increased number of service disconnections 

table of contents in the communications industry  continued pricing pressure from our competitors and an excess of network capacity continue to cause prices for our services to decline 
in  we continued to experience decreases in the prices of our services of up to in recurring monthly charges 
we anticipate that prices for broadband network services  in general  and for our services  in particular  will continue to decline dramatically over the next several years due primarily to the following price competition as various service providers continue to sell services at greatly reduced process to absorb significant excess capacity in existing networks and continue to install additional networks that compete with our networks  recent technological advances that permit substantial increases in the transmission capacity and more efficient utilization of both new and existing fiber  and strategic alliances  consolidations or similar transactions that increase customers purchasing power 
many of our customers and vendors are experiencing financial difficulties and have filed or may file for bankruptcy protection 
the recent general economic weakness has severely impacted the telecommunications industry 
the expected demand for broadband connectivity has not been realized in many segments of the market 
as a result  there has been an industry wide slowdown in capital spending and a large number of industry related bankruptcy filings 
many of our customers and vendors are currently experiencing financial distress  and some of them have filed for bankruptcy protection 
we have contracts with communications providers that have filed for relief from creditors under the bankruptcy code  as well as contracts with other communications providers who may still yet file for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  there is a significant doubt that some of our customers or vendors will perform their obligations under our contracts with them 
in bankruptcy proceedings  the debtor  or trustee  as the case may be  has the right to  among other things  reject certain contracts 
in the past  bankruptcy courts have determined that certain of our contracts with our customers constitute executory contracts  and the contracts were rejected 
as a result  we received an unsecured claim for damages against the debtors  and all rights and privileges under the contracts were terminated  including payment for services rendered 
there can be no assurance that additional customers or vendors will not seek bankruptcy protection and that additional contracts will be terminated 
we may require additional capital to fund the further development of our networks and operation of our business  and an inability to obtain such capital could harm our business 
although we have substantially completed the build out of our networks  we may selectively expand our networks in the future as market conditions and customer demand dictate 
in addition  we may have to expand or adapt our networks to respond to the following an increasing number of customers  demand for greater network capacity or colocation space  the replacement of inadequate or malfunctioning network elements  changes in our customers service requirements  and technological advances 
to do so  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
if we raise funds through the issuance of equity securities  the ownership percentage of our then current stockholders will be diluted and the holders of new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the 
table of contents holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised through another bank credit facility or the issuance of debt securities  the holders of such indebtedness would have rights senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock  and the terms of this indebtedness could impose restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and on our operations  which could impede the successful completion of our business plan 
if our actual results vary from the anticipated results of our operating plan  we may not be able to fund operating and investing activities with internally generated cash flows  and we may require external sources of capital 
from time to time  we may consider private or public sales of additional equity or debt securities and other financings  depending upon market conditions  in order to finance the continued operations of our business or for other strategic purposes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
our inability to obtain additional financing  as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  nor do we anticipate entering into any 
we must maintain our existing agreements for space in major carrier hotels or our business will be harmed 
our business depends upon our ability to lease space in carrier hotels to establish carrier point facilities where we can locate our networking equipment and interconnect with our customers 
at a minimum  to provide our services in a particular metropolitan area  we must obtain space in the major carrier hotels in that area 
in addition  we need adequate space at our carrier point facilities in order to continue offering colocation services 
there may be significant competition for space in major carrier hotels 
our inability to obtain additional space  or our inability to renew existing leases  would negatively impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to increase the number of our significant customers and the volume of traffic on our networks or our business may suffer 
our revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that are affecting our industry 
we have experienced significant disconnections of services by our customers and decreases in the prices of our services 
as a result  we should increase the current volume of traffic on our networks in order to realize anticipated revenues and cash flows 
to do so  we must obtain long term commitments from new large volume customers  as well as expand our relationships with current customers 
this need is more critical as a wholesale carrier because our potential customers are a limited number of service providers 
therefore  it is essential for us to succeed at establishing and expanding customer relationships  otherwise our business will suffer 
if we cannot maintain the scalability  reliability and speed of our network  potential customers will not use our services 
because of the limited deployment of our services  our ability to manage a substantial amount of traffic on our networks while maintaining superior service is unknown at this time 
there is no assurance that our network will be able to maintain current levels of service as the number of our customers and amount of traffic grows 
our failure to maintain such levels of service would significantly reduce customer demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business 
service interruptions on our networks could expose us to liability or cause us to lose customers 
our operations depend on our ability to prevent or mitigate any damages from power losses  network failures  transmission cable cuts or natural disasters 
the failure of any equipment or facility on our networks could result in the interruption of service until we make the necessary repairs or install replacement equipment 
if service is not restored in a timely manner  agreements with our customers may obligate us to provide credits or 
table of contents other remedies to them  which would reduce our revenues or increase our expenses and may be exposed to litigation from our customers 
service disruptions could also damage our reputation with customers  causing us to lose existing customers or to have difficulty attracting new ones 
many of our customers communications needs are extremely time sensitive  and delays in signal delivery may cause significant losses to a customer using our networks 
our networks may also contain undetected design faults and software bugs that  despite our testing  may be discovered only after our networks have been completed and are in use 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or act of terrorism in close proximity to our facilities would substantially harm our business 
the substantial majority of our facilities are located within the new york metropolitan area  with the remainder located in chicago and los angeles 
in particular  our facilities located at hudson street and eighth avenue in new york city are critical to our business 
given the concentration of our facilities  the loss of one of our facilities through the occurrence of a natural disaster  fire or flood  or an act of terrorism would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for losses caused by such an occurrence  and we may not be able to operate our business after the loss of one of our facilities 
our failure to manage the growth of our operations could harm our business 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations 
we anticipate that further expansion will be required to grow our customer base if we are to be successful in implementing our business strategy 
our future performance depends in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
our business will be harmed if our information support systems are not further developed 
sophisticated information processing systems  including provisioning  accounting and network management  are vital to our growth and our ability to achieve operating efficiencies 
our plans for the development and implementation of these systems rely largely upon acquiring products and services from third party vendors and integrating those products and services 
we may be unable to implement these systems on a timely basis or at all  and these systems may not perform as expected 
a failure of these systems could substantially impair our ability to provide services  send invoices and monitor our operations 
we may also be unable to maintain and upgrade our operational support systems as necessary 
we license key software from third parties 
if we are unable to obtain such software on commercially acceptable terms  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on software licensed from third parties  including applications that are integrated with internally developed software and used in our services 
most notably  we license preside and metasolv tbs 
these third party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and we may not be able to obtain licenses for other existing or future technologies that we desire to integrate into our services 
although we believe that there are alternative suppliers for the software that we rely upon  it could take a significant period of time to establish relationships with alternative suppliers and integrate their software into our services 
the loss of any of our relationships with these suppliers could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team  none of whom currently has an employment agreement with us 
the death or departure of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we may become the subject of litigation by our stockholders  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition to claims that may arise in the normal course of our business and financing activities  certain of our stockholders may sue us in an attempt to recover their losses as a result of the decline in our stock price  which has been significant since the resolution of such a claim would likely be costly and time consuming 
if any or all of such claims cannot be resolved through a negotiated settlement  we could become a party to the resulting litigation 
any litigation  even if we are successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
an adverse determination in any litigation could also subject us to significant liability  under the judgment of a court or by default 
we may face competition from various service providers in buildings for which we have exclusive license agreements 
we generally have exclusive license agreements for both our on net and off net buildings 
even though our competitors cannot install a central distribution system in any of our buildings covered by an exclusive agreement  they may still compete with us by installing infrastructure designed to directly service one or more specific tenants in the building as requested by such tenants 
consequently  they could indirectly compete against us by not utilizing our in building networks to gain connectivity to tenants 
in addition  incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  and the regional bell operating companies  or rbocs  currently own pre existing  copper based networks in many of our on net and off net buildings 
these ilecs and rbocs may be able to upgrade their existing networks to provide advanced broadband services which would place them in direct competition with us 
furthermore  service providers may have pre existing license agreements in our buildings  which allow these providers to install  and possibly expand  their network infrastructure in our buildings 
as a result  we may face competition in some of the buildings for which we have exclusive license agreements 
alternative technologies pose competitive threats 
in addition to fiber optic technology  there are other technologies that provide more capacity and speed than traditional copper wire transmission technology  such as digital subscriber lines  or dsl  and wireless technologies  and can be used instead of our networks 
furthermore  these technologies may be improved and other new technologies may be developed that provide more capacity  reliability  scalability and speed than the fiber optic technology we deploy 
the development of new technologies or the significant penetration of alternative technologies into our target markets may reduce the demand for our services and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have outstanding debt that may limit our ability to borrow additional money  restrict the use of our cash flows and constrain our business strategy  and we may not be able to meet our debt obligations 
as of march   we had total outstanding debt of million  with the availability to borrow an additional million 
as a result of this debt and debt that we may incur in the future  we will need to devote a portion of our available cash towards debt service payments 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional money is restricted by our current debt arrangements 
furthermore  we have agreed to terms in the credit agreement which governs our credit facility that expose us to certain risks and limitations  including the following as the interest rate on our debt is variable  if interest rates rise  our debt service payments will increase  principal amortization payments are required to be made quarterly and extend through maturity in  we have made affirmative financial covenants that we will breach if our financial results do not meet our expectations  and we have agreed to certain negative covenants that may cause us to make choices regarding the operation of our business that we would not otherwise make 
you should be aware that our ability to repay or refinance our debt depends on our successful financial and operating performance and on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
we cannot assure you 
table of contents that our future cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to repay our existing indebtedness and any indebtedness we may incur in the future  or that we will be successful in obtaining alternative financing 
further  our borrowings under our credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  and our obligations under our facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
in the event that we are unable to repay our debts  we may be forced to reduce or delay the completion or expansion of our networks  sell some of our assets  obtain additional equity capital or refinance or restructure our debt 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our covenants  we would be in default under our existing debt agreements  which would accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness 
our failure to achieve certain financial results would also violate certain covenants  potentially accelerating the outstanding balance of our debt for immediate payment 
to avoid a default  we may need waivers from third parties  which might not be granted 
legislation and government regulation could adversely affect us 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations that affect our services  competition  the taxation of our services and other aspects of our operations 
the regulation of the communications industry is changing rapidly  and varies from state to state 
changes in the regulatory environment could affect our operating results by increasing competition  decreasing revenue  increasing costs or impairing our ability to offer services 
certain communications services are subject to significant regulation at the federal and state level 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  regulates communications carriers providing intrastate  interstate and international common carrier services 
state public utility commissions exercise jurisdiction over intrastate communications services 
the fcc and state public utility commissions do not regulate most enhanced services  which involve more than the pure transmission of customer provided information 
our subsidiary  local fiber  llc  is regulated as a common carrier by virtue of its provision of communications services directly to the public for a fee 
as a common carrier  local fiber  llc is subject to extensive federal  state and local communications regulation  which includes the payment of all applicable regulatory assessments 
many of our competitors and vendors  especially ilecs  are subject to federal and state regulations 
these regulations change from time to time in ways that are difficult for us to predict 
although we believe the services we provide today  other than those provided by local fiber  llc  are not subject to regulation imposed on other telecommunications services by the fcc or the state public utility commissions  changes in regulation or new legislation may impose regulation on our non regulated services 
regulation of access to office buildings could negatively affect our business 
some states have adopted laws that require that commercial building owners provide non discriminatory access to communications providers 
the fcc has released its decision relating to access to commercial multiple tenant buildings  and legislation was enacted that increases telecommunications access to buildings owned or used by the federal government 
among other decisions  the fcc prohibited telecommunications carriers from entering into exclusive agreements with commercial building owners on a prospective basis  and required utilities  including local exchange carriers  to provide access to other telecommunications carriers and cable service providers 
other building access issues remain to be addressed by the fcc 
depending on how these rules are interpreted  these requirements may facilitate our competitors entry into buildings in which we offer our services  which in turn will diminish the value of our access rights and adversely affect our competitive position 
as an access provider  we may incur liability for information disseminated through our networks 
the law relating to the liability of access providers and on line services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is unsettled 
although we have not been sued for information carried on our networks  it is possible that we could be 
federal and state statutes have been directed at imposing liability on internet service providers for aspects of content carried on their networks 
there may be new legislation and court decisions that may affect our services and expose us to potential liability 
as the law in this area develops  the potential imposition of liability for information carried on and disseminated through our networks could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such 
table of contents liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources or the discontinuation of certain products or services offerings 
any significant costs that we incur as a result of such measures or the imposition of liability could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our operating expenses and our liquidity 
our principal stockholders  directors and executive officers currently control a significant percentage of the voting rights of our stock  and this may limit your ability to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote or exercise any influence over our business 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  merger  consolidation  or tender offer that could involve a premium over the price of our common stock 
currently  our executive officers  directors and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if they vote together  are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions and matters 
anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change of control that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that would provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
the authorization of undesignated preferred stock  for example  gives our board the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the company 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  this premium may not be realized  or the market price of our common stock could decline 
holders of our common stock will not receive a return on their shares until they sell them because we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our shares 
we have neither declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
we currently intend to retain any earnings to fund operations and future growth 
furthermore  our credit facility currently prohibits  and the terms of any future debt agreements or preferred stock will likely restrict  the payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is highly volatile 
failure to meet market expectations because of quarterly fluctuations in our financial results could cause our stock price to decline 
moreover  factors that are not related to our operating performance could cause our stock price to decline 
the stock market has periodically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for securities of technology and communications companies 
consequently  you may experience a decrease in the market value of your common stock  regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
we could issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have approximately million shares of common stock subject issuance upon exercise of outstanding to stock options and warrants 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of common stock  or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or warrants  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our credit facility and marketable security investments 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates  based upon libor or a base rate plus an applicable margin 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
a basis point increase in libor would increase our annual interest expense by less than million per year 
as of march   we had borrowed million under our credit facility  with a current weighted average interest rate of we generally place our marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of less than one year
