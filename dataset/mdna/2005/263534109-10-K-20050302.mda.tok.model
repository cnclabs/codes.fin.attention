item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dupont has seven segments 
five of the segments constitute the company s growth platforms agriculture nutrition  coatings color technologies  electronic communication technologies  performance materials  and safety protection 
the pharmaceuticals segment includes income from the company s interest in two angiotensin ii antagonist aiia drugs  cozaar and hyzaar 
the seventh segment is textiles interiors 
on april   dupont sold the majority of the net assets of textiles interiors  referred to as invista  to koch see page and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the sale of invista was an important milestone in reducing the company s exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and better positioning the company for long term profitable growth 
the company has set sustainable annual financial targets of percent revenue growth  percent earnings growth  and one percentage point improvement in return on invested capital roic 
in  earnings per share improved percent  and roic increased by percentage points 
while consolidated net sales increased percent  net sales of the five growth platforms increased billion  more than offsetting a billion reduction in net sales following the sale of invista 
the company s performance reflected the strength of the five growth platforms and successful execution of the company s three key strategies putting science to work  harnessing the power of one dupont  and going where the growth is 
putting science to work science helps form the capabilities  offerings and competitive advantages of all of the company s businesses 
the company is not focused on a single blockbuster innovation  but seeks growth by generating dozens of new products with million to million in annual sales 
market driven innovation  which relies on the voice of the customer and concrete market opportunities  has been central to the revitalization of the company s research efforts 
the result is an increased percentage of sales from new products 
the company has set a goal of deriving percent of revenues from products less than five years old by power of one dupont the company s strategy is to increase productivity and leverage market access  capabilities and customers  with a single entity focus  thereby creating wider opportunities for the numerous business units across the entire company 
productivity initiatives include revitalizing the company s research and development program  improving the effectiveness of its sales efforts  implementing various pricing initiatives  improving working capital efficiency  and pursuing a million cost improvement program 
in  the company s strategic pricing initiative supported a percent average increase in local currency pricing for the growth platforms  and total company us dollar usd pricing increased percent  aided in part by currency impact of the weaker usd and a more favorable pricing environment in many global markets 
pricing momentum improved through  with local prices more than offsetting the impact of higher raw material costs in the second half of the year 
through continued focus on its working capital efficiency  the company improved its days sales outstanding metric by day and its inventory days supply metric by days 
cost improvements  including substantial workforce reductions during  procurement initiatives  and targeted spending reductions  have all contributed to a percentage point reduction in cost of goods sold and other operating charges as a percentage of net sales 
going where the growth is the company seeks significant growth opportunities by increasing its presence in emerging markets and extending the company s science  products  brands and market position into new applications and uses  thereby creating new addressable market spaces 
the company has a strong presence in most of the fastest growing emerging markets and continues to leverage its presence and market position to realize new growth 
in the five growth platforms  segment sales in china prc  taiwan and hong kong  grew percent collectively  while segment sales in eastern europe  including turkey and the countries of the former soviet union  grew percent 
another opportunity for growth is in expanding the company s addressable markets 
one example is tyvek nonwoven sheet structures  the longstanding leader in house wrap 
it is now also being used for roofing systems and window seal applications in an expanding building innovations market 
other examples include kevlar and nomex aramids  which are finding new and varied applications in the personal protection market 
financial discipline the company seeks to execute these strategies in a financially prudent manner and plans to continue its cash discipline policy 
the current policy is first  to maintain a strong balance sheet and second  to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling 
the company s cash discipline policy and strong liquidity profile are important to its long term growth 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances of billion and bank credit lines of billion as of december   provide primary liquidity to support all short term obligations 
secondary liquidity  sufficient to meet upcoming debt maturities  comes from excellent access to capital markets  strong cash flow generation and the ability to sell assets

critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts  including  but not limited to  receivable and inventory valuations  impairment of tangible and intangible assets  postretirement employee benefit obligations  income taxes  restructuring reserves  environmental matters  and litigation 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  facts and circumstances available at the time  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate 
management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits in connection with the company s postretirement benefit plans  the fair value of assets in all pension plans was billion at december   and the related benefit obligations were billion 
in addition  obligations under the company s unfunded other postretirement benefit plans were billion at december  expected return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions are particularly important when determining the company s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits 
the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pretax earnings due to changes in these assumptions with respect to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  dollars in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease discount rate expected rate of return on plan pension assets additional information with respect to pension and other postretirement employee expenses and liabilities is discussed under long term employee benefits beginning on page environmental matters dupont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made 
the company s estimates are based on a number of factors  including the complexity of the site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites  and the number of and financial viability of other prps 
the company has recorded a liability of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted 
considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and  under adverse changes in circumstances  the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued 
much of this liability results from the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  often referred to as the superfund  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state laws 
these laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations  and could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company generated waste disposal 
over the next two decades  the company may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site 
these activities  and their associated costs  depend on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  as well as the presence or absence of prps 
therefore  it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of future site remediation costs 
a detailed discussion of environmental matters is contained in management s discussion and analysis  beginning on page legal contingencies the company s results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company  including product liability claims  patent infringement claims and antitrust claims 
the company records reserves for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management makes adjustments to these reserves to reflect the impact and status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter 
predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims  the company s experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  input from outside legal counsel  the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter s current status 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation reserve when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding 
in such situations  the company will not recognize a loss if  based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information  management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal 
a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the breadth of the company s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company s tax assets and tax liabilities 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 
for example  changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets would result in recording a valuation allowance  thereby reducing the net deferred tax asset 
in some situations these changes could be material 
in and  dupont recorded million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets associated with two european subsidiaries for their tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns 
realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time 
as a result  changes in tax laws  assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets 
valuation of assets assessment of the potential impairment of property  plant and equipment  goodwill  other purchased intangible assets  and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company s normal ongoing review of operations 
testing for potential impairment of long lived assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management s best estimates at a particular point in time 
the dynamic economic environments in which the company s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices  market growth and inflation rates  can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests 
estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results 
changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments  as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized 
future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges 
information with respect to the company s significant accounting policies on long lived assets is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate outlook dupont expects earnings per share to be between and 
continued success in executing the company s growth strategies  productivity initiatives  and its cash discipline principles is expected to improve earnings per share and cash flow versus the company s agriculture businesses are highly seasonal 
about two thirds of the company s annual revenues have historically been realized in the first half of the calendar year 
as a result  the company expects that approximately percent of earnings per share will be realized within the first half of the year 
based on historic patterns of seasonality  first half earnings per share are expected to be about evenly split between the first and second quarters 
key expectations underlying this outlook are global economy worldwide industrial economic growth is expected to be close to its year historical trend line rate of percent  with stronger growth in eastern europe  china and latin america  and growth slightly below this trend in north america  western europe  and japan 
raw material costs are expected to increase above  as oil and us natural gas prices persist at current levels 
revenue growth revenues from new products are expected to increase to percent of total revenue as the company continues to introduce new products and realizes the full advantage of hundreds of new products introduced in the previous four years

agriculture nutrition segment sales dollars in billions ptoi dollars in millions agriculture nutrition leverages dupont technology  customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity  quality and safety of the global food supply 
global land area that can be used in agricultural production is increasingly limited 
therefore  increases in production will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted acreage 
agriculture nutrition delivers a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity  including pioneer brand seed products and well established brands of insecticides  fungicides and herbicides 
the segment operates across the food value chain from inputs for production agriculture to global production and distribution of soy based food ingredients  food quality diagnostic testing equipment and services  and liquid food packaging systems 
research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits  superior germplasm  and the effective use of insecticides  herbicides and fungicides 
agriculture nutrition includes the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pioneer hi bred international  inc pioneer 
pioneer is the world s largest seed producer and the world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide insect protection and herbicide tolerance 
the principal products of pioneer are hybrid seed corn and soybean seed 
pioneer benefited in from the successful launch of its largest technology offering in its history with new soybean varieties and new pioneer brand corn hybrids that include new options for corn borer control  corn rootworm control and weed management 
while the commercial seed industry for major crops remained stable in  sales for pioneer grew percent 
sales growth was driven by increased market share in key segments of the corn and soybean markets  as well as strong product performance and price increases in most markets 
herbicide and insect resistant traits  along with high yielding genetics  also supported sales 
the purchase of verdia during the third quarter of will provide pioneer the opportunity to improve its trait discovery capabilities through the use of gene shuffling technology 
agriculture nutrition also serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products in the grain and specialty crop sectors  forestry  and vegetation management 
principal crop protection products are herbicides  fungicides  insect control products and plant growth regulators 
sales of crop protection products increased percent  with the most significant market share growth in insecticides  specifically in specialty crops in asia pacific 
the segment strengthened its global position in products for cotton due to its broad array of offerings 
the november acquisition of the remaining percent ownership interest in griffin llc strengthened the segment s product sales and manufacturing resources to better serve customers 
the segment also expanded its presence in fruit and vegetable specialty markets and entered the professional pest control market with the launch of several new product offerings 
agriculture nutrition also serves the specialty food ingredients market  including soy proteins and lecithins through its majority owned venture with bunge limited  the solae company 
in addition  the segment offers systems for the aseptic packaging of beverages  dairy products and pumpable foods in retail and institutional applications 
sales of specialty foods grew percent in  of which percent resulted from the formation of the solae company in soy crush sales growth was driven by higher commodity prices 
versus sales of billion increased percent reflecting percent higher usd selling prices  percent higher volumes  and a percent benefit resulting from the formation of the solae company and the acquisition of the remaining interest in griffin llc 
higher selling prices were driven by a richer mix in corn and soybean seed  reflecting the success of the technology offering 
volume growth was driven by higher corn sales throughout all regions as well as increased soybean sales in the northern hemisphere  higher sales of insecticides in asia pacific and higher worldwide sales of soy based products 
ptoi was million versus million in  up percent 
the improvement in ptoi reflects higher usd selling prices and higher sales volumes  partly offset by higher raw material costs

higher usd selling prices resulted principally from currency translation  reflecting the weaker dollar 
volume growth principally reflects increased corn seed sales in markets outside of north america  higher sales of herbicides in north america  a significant increase in insecticide sales in asia pacific  and higher worldwide sales of soy based products 
ptoi was million  including a benefit of million principally attributable to the formation of the solae company 
this compares to ptoi of million in  which included a benefit of million related to revisions in post employment costs for pioneer  a million charge to reflect an expected loss on the sale of a manufacturing facility in europe  and a million charge to write off inventories of discontinued herbicide products 
the improvement in ptoi also reflected the benefits of higher volumes and favorable currency exchange rates  which were partly offset by higher non cash pension expense and raw material costs 
outlook the value of world commodity agricultural production excluding horticulture and forestry was at record levels in except in the middle east  africa  and the former soviet union 
the global level is forecast to decline percent from the high 
despite this forecast  is expected to exceed the average by percent and still suggests a relatively positive environment 
the economic outlook for north american production agriculture the largest market for the segment is positive for despite lower commodity grain prices 
farm income is up primarily due to higher production resulting from higher yields 
demand from the livestock and industrial sectors in is expected to increase for commodity grains and oilseeds 
north american production agriculture is expected to remain stable as net farm income reached record levels in  grain storage is at historically low levels  and the growers debt to equity and debt to asset ratios will be at their lowest levels since the early s 
because of the positive economic environment  crop production in the us and canada is expected to continue at historically high levels 
due to these market factors and a number of company specific actions  the segment expects double digit growth again in pioneer expects to increase profitability through corn value offerings and seed treatments in north america  and through volume gains in international markets 
profitability is also expected to be driven by a continued market share gain in the north american soybean market

liquidity capital resources the company considers its strong financial position and financial flexibility to be a competitive advantage 
the company s credit ratings of aa and aa from standard poor s s p and moody s investors services moody s  respectively  and its commercial paper rating of a by s p and prime by moody s are evidence of that strength 
this advantage is based on strong business operating cash flows over an economic cycle  and a commitment to cash discipline regarding working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
sources of liquidity the company s liquidity needs can be met through a variety of independent sources  including cash provided by operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  marketable debt securities  commercial paper markets  syndicated credit lines  bilateral credit lines  equity and long term debt markets  and asset sales 
the company s cash provided by operating activities was billion in  a million increase from the billion generated in the year over year increase is primarily the result of higher earnings 
the improvement reflects higher selling prices  volume growth  and favorable currency exchange rates  partly offset by higher energy and raw material costs 
the company s cash provided by operating activities was billion in  a million increase from the billion generated in the year over year increase is a result of lower income tax payments  partially offset by higher raw material costs  termination of the accounts receivable securitization program and funding of the dupont canada pension fund in preparation for the separation of invista 
cash and cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities totaled billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
the decrease from to is primarily attributable to the billion of cash used to purchase the shares of dupont canada from the minority owners in connection with the sale of invista  and the redemption of corporate minority interest structures 
the commercial paper market is a source of same day cash for the company 
given the company s strong credit rating  it has excellent access to this market at preferred rates 
the weighted average interest rates before taxes on commercial paper borrowings for  and  were  and percent  respectively 
at december  dupont s commercial paper balance was million  billion and million for  and  respectively 
the billion decrease from to was primarily attributable to the use of proceeds from the sale of invista to pay down commercial paper

in the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short term liquidity needs  the company has access to approximately billion in same day credit lines with several major financial institutions 
these credit lines are split about equally between day and multi year facilities 
dupont also has access to equity markets and to long term debt capital markets 
the company s current relatively low long term borrowing level  strong financial position and credit ratings provide excellent access to these markets

additional details related to the acquisitions are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlements of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company s net exposure  by currency  related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in cash payments of million in  million in and million in the payments were primarily attributable to the weaker usd versus the euro and larger net monetary asset positions 
these settlements were largely offset by revaluations of the items being hedged  which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
dividends per share of common stock were in each year

new legislation on october   president bush signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan 
some of the options for reinvestment permitted in the act include hiring and training workers  infrastructure and capital investments  research and development  debt repayment and funding of qualified benefit plan obligations 
uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the act 
the passage of statutory technical corrections and the issuance of other us treasury guidance with respect to certain provisions in the act may determine what amounts  if any  the company will repatriate 
dupont is not yet in a position to determine whether  and to what extent  foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the united states may be repatriated 
under the act  the company could repatriate up to billion 
however  no determination has been made as to how much  if any  will be repatriated 
furthermore  the related income tax effects cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
dupont expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment by mid year because the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries are deemed to be permanently reinvested as of december   no deferred tax liability has been recognized in the company s financial statements 
financial condition total debt at december  was billion  a decrease of billion from december   primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale of invista to pay down commercial paper 
in addition to the level of debt  the mix of the company s debt also changed 
commercial paper decreased billion and in april the company issued billion of six and ten year notes 
these notes essentially refinanced the billion of maturing long term notes due in and extended the company s maturity profile 
total debt at the end of was billion  a billion increase from the billion level at the end of total debt increased in as a result of the redemption of the corporate minority interest structures  acquisition of the minority shares held in dupont canada  termination of the accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs that were financed by the commercial paper conduit and buyout of certain synthetic leases not covered under the commercial paper conduit 
in addition  the company s debt increased million  reflecting debt balances assumed as a result of acquiring the remaining interest in griffin llc 
additional information regarding the termination of the corporate minority interest structures is described below 
the company s commercial paper increased billion essentially for the reasons described above 
the company s average interest rate at december was  and in  and  respectively 
the change in the rates is due primarily to the level of lower rate commercial paper at year end 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
at december   net debt was billion  compared to billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
the company defines net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
management believes that net debt is meaningful because it provides the investor with a more realistic view of the company s liquidity and debt position since the company s cash balance is available to meet operating and capital needs  as well as to provide liquidity around the world 
net debt also allows the investor to more easily compare cash flow between periods without adjusting for changes in cash and debt 
the following table reconciles the differences from total debt to net debt

these corporate structures had been established in and the associated costs were being amortized on a straight line basis over a five year period 
certain guarantee contracts indemnifications the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures  and related business activities prior to the completion of the transactions 
the terms of these indemnifications  which typically pertain to environmental  tax and product liabilities  are generally indefinite 
in addition  the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law  against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company  such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters 
if the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim  pursuant to the terms of the indemnification  the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party 
the maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited 
the carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of december  and is million and million  respectively 
although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued  due to the nature of indemnified items  it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss 
no assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist 
in connection with the sale of invista  the company indemnified koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes  legal and environmental matters  and other representations and warranties 
the estimated fair value of these obligations of million is included in the indemnifications balance of million at december  the fair value was based on management s best estimate of the value expected to be required to issue the indemnifications in a stand alone  arm s length transaction with an unrelated party and  where appropriate  by the utilization of probability weighted discounted net cash flow models 
the company does not believe that these indemnities will have a material impact on the future liquidity of the company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
part ii obligations for equity affiliates and others the company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates  customers  suppliers and other unaffiliated companies 
at december   the company had directly guaranteed million of such obligations  plus million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries 
this represents the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees 
the company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party 
no material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees 
at december   the liabilities recorded for these obligations were not material 
existing guarantees for customers and suppliers arose as part of contractual agreements 
existing guarantees for equity affiliates arose for liquidity needs in normal operations 
in certain cases  the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers 
the company has historically guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to divested subsidiaries including conoco and its subsidiaries and affiliates  invista entities sold to koch  and consolidation coal sales company 
the restructuring  transfer and separation agreement between dupont and conoco requires conoco to use its best efforts to have conoco  or any of its subsidiaries  substitute for dupont 
conoco  koch and consolidation coal sales company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees 
no material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees 
at december   the company has no liabilities recorded for these obligations 
additional information with respect to the company s guarantees is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations  however  the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees should unforeseen circumstances arise 
off balance sheet arrangements commercial paper facility in  the company implemented a commercial paper conduit program to reduce the financing costs of the company s accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs by gaining direct access to the asset backed commercial paper market 
the conduit issued notes to third parties secured by the receivable interests and the equipment and real estate under synthetic leases 
in  the company terminated its accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs that were financed by the commercial paper conduit 
this required the company to purchase an ownership interest in the trade accounts receivable being held under the accounts receivable securitization program for million and assets under synthetic leases for million 
the trade accounts receivable were collected in other synthetic leases during  the company purchased the assets under its synthetic leases related to manufacturing and warehousing facilities under construction which were not covered under the commercial paper conduit for million 
as of december   the company has one remaining synthetic lease program relating to miscellaneous short lived equipment valued at approximately million 
lease payments for these assets totaled million in  million in  and million in  and were reported as operating expenses in the consolidated income statement 
the leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
furthermore  the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month libor 
the company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets 
should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option  it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount  which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party 
residual value guarantees totaled million at december  contractual obligations information related to the company s significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table dollars in millions payments due in total at december  and beyond long term debt     capital leases operating leases purchase obligations obligations to koch  raw material obligations excluding koch advertising sponsorships information technology infrastructure and services research and development agreements utility obligations other total purchase obligations  other long term liabilities  workers compensation asset retirement obligations environmental remediation other total other long term liabilities total contractual obligations     included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the agreement 
includes raw material supply obligations of billion and contract manufacturing obligations of million 
primarily represents obligations associated with distribution  health care benefit administration  and other professional and consulting contracts 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within long term employee benefits 
primarily represents employee related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise 
long term employee benefits the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees 
the company maintains retirement related programs in many countries that have a long term impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans  and medical  dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors 
about percent of the company s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions  and more than percent of the company s worldwide benefit obligation for retiree medical  dental and life insurance benefits are attributable to the benefit plans covering substantially all us employees 
where permitted by applicable law  the company reserves the right to change  modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension and medical  dental and life insurance benefits 
benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement 
in the us  pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with us federal laws and regulations 
the company does not make contributions that are in excess of federal tax deductible limits 
the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits 
no contributions are currently required to be made to the principal us pension plan in the company will monitor asset values during  and will determine later in the year whether a voluntary contribution is appropriate 
contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows 
pension coverage for employees of the company s non us consolidated subsidiaries is provided  to the extent deemed appropriate  through separate plans 
funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates 
thus  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense 
in general  however  reduced asset valuations tend to result in higher contributions to pension plans 
in  the company contributed million to its pension plans  including million to its principal us pension plan 
the company anticipates that it will make approximately million in contributions in to pension plans other than the principal us pension plan 
generally accepted accounting principles require the full reflection of the amount of pension under funding  if any  defined as the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the amount of pension assets as of the measurement date 
to the extent this amount has not already been fully reflected  the company is required to reflect an additional minimum pension liability  and any adjustment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
for this purpose  each of the company s pension plans must be tested individually 
at year end  a non cash after tax charge of billion to stockholders equity was recorded in response to lower asset valuations and somewhat higher benefit obligations as of that date 
most of this adjustment is attributable to the principal us pension plan 
in and  million and  million  respectively  of this charge was reversed  reflecting the net effect of recovering asset values  company contributions  and changes in discount rates 
medical  dental and life insurance plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows 
pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
this amount is expected to be about million in changes in cash requirements during this period reflect higher per capita health care costs  demographic changes  and changes in participant premiums  co pays and deductibles 
the company s income can be significantly affected by pension benefits as well as retiree medical  dental and life insurance benefits 
the following table summarizes the extent to which the company s income over each of the last three years was affected by pretax charges and credits related to long term employee benefits 
pretax dollars in millions pension charges credits other postretirement benefit charges credits net charge these expenses are determined as of the beginning of each year 
the increase in pension cost is primarily due to lower discount rates and settlement charges associated with the sale of invista 
the decrease in other postretirement benefit expenses reflects the effects of plan amendments made in and for its us parent company medical and dental plans  and the curtailment gains recognized as part of the sale of invista in the company s key assumptions used in calculating its long term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increases  and the discount rate see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in anticipation of a significant reduction in the number of employees related to the pending invista sale  the company recorded a pretax curtailment loss of million in upon completing the sale of invista in  the company recorded a pretax net settlement and curtailment gain of million from its postretirement benefit plans other than pension  and a million net settlement and curtailment charge for its pension plans 
an additional million curtailment charge was recorded in connection with restructuring programs 
environmental matters dupont operates global manufacturing facilities  product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations 
company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  dupont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions  eliminate the generation of hazardous waste  decrease the volume of waste water discharges  increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent  bioaccumulative and toxic materials 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations  as well as internal voluntary programs and goals  are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
in  dupont spent about million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company s internal environmental goals 
the company currently estimates expenditures for environmental related capital projects will total million in in the us  significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment  storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the clean air act caa 
until all caa regulatory requirements are established and known  considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures 
total caa capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from million to million 
the environmental protection agency epa challenged the us chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly  high production volume hpv chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available 
an hpv chemical is a chemical listed on the inventory update rule with annual us cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more 
since  dupont has spent an estimated million on hpv testing and estimates it will spend another million to complete the original hpv testing program 
an extended hpv program is under consideration by the american chemistry council that may result in another to chemicals being tested under dupont s sponsorship 
this extended program has not yet been approved 
since  the entire chemical industry has spent an estimated million on hpv testing 
global climate change is being addressed by the united nations framework convention on climate change the convention adopted in the kyoto protocol the protocol  adopted in december  is an effort to establish short term actions under the convention 
the protocol entered into force in february in most countries in which dupont operates 
the united states has declined to ratify the protocol 
the european union eu has already begun a program to reduce emissions that includes an emissions trading system linked to the protocol 
the united states continues to pursue a less restrictive climate policy framework  emphasizing voluntary action 
the protocol establishes significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential and is driving mandatory reductions in developed nations outside the united states 
dupont has a stake in a number of these gases co  gases coo  hfcs and pfcs and has been reducing its emissions of these gases since dupont remains well ahead of the target and timetable of the protocol 
however  the company faces the possibility of country specific restrictions where major reductions have not yet been achieved and has faced high energy prices in europe and the united states in recent years due  at least in part  to expectations of emission reduction mandates 
dupont is participating in emissions trading in the eu and elsewhere that could aid in satisfying such country specific requirements 
emission reduction mandates within the united states are not expected in the near future  although congressional proposals for such mandates have been introduced 
dupont has discovered that very low levels of dioxins parts per trillion to low parts per billion and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process 
the company has launched an extensive research and process engineering development program to identify the cause of the dioxin generation and to identify process modifications that will eliminate dioxin formation 
the programs implemented to date have resulted in reductions of almost percent  significant progress against dupont s aggressive goals to reduce such dioxin generation by percent by over percent of the dioxin generated at dupont s production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible 
dupont uses pfoa  perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts  including the ammonium salt  as a processing aid to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions 
for a detailed discussion of environmental issues concerning pfoa  see environmental proceedings on page of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled million in compared with million in  and million in these expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below  operating  maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste  air and water pollution control facilities  and the costs of environmental research activities 
while expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company s overall environmental expenses  the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development 
the largest of the environmental expenses in were million from the operation of water pollution control facilities and million for solid waste management facilities 
about percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the united states 
remediation accruals at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability of million compared to million at year end considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and  under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of december  of the million accrued liability  approximately percent was reserved for non us facilities 
approximately percent of the reserve balance was attributable to rcra and similar remediation liabilities  while percent was attributable to cercla liabilities 
during  remediation accruals of million were added to the reserve and nearly million of remediation liabilities were transferred to koch as part of the sale of invista 
in  million was added to the reserve balance 
remediation expenditures rcra extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous waste 
rcra requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility 
if conditions warrant  companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
in contrast to cercla  the costs of the rcra corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company 
the company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required over the next two decades 
annual expenditures for the near term  however  are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years 
longer term  expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
the company s expenditures associated with rcra and similar remediation activities were approximately million in  million in  and million in the company  from time to time  receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a prp under cercla or similar state statute 
the company has also  on occasion  been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned  but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company s past operations 
as of december   the company had been notified of potential liability under cercla or state laws at sites around the united states  with active remediation under way at of these sites 
in addition  the company has resolved its liability at sites  either by completing remedial actions with other prps or by participating in de minimis buyouts with other prps whose waste  like the company s  represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site 
the company received notice of potential liability at four new sites during compared with five similar notices in  and eight in in  three sites were settled by the company 
the company s expenditures associated with cercla and similar state remediation activities were approximately million in  million in  and million in for nearly all superfund sites  the company s potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other prps is relatively low 
other prps at sites where the company is a party typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and  where they do not  or where prps cannot be located  the company s own share of liability has not materially increased 
there are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant  and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites  and at all cercla sites in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position  liquidity or results of operations of the company 
total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under cercla  rcra and similar state laws were million in  million in  and million in part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments derivatives and other hedging instruments under procedures and controls established by the company s financial risk management framework  the company enters into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price risks 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and exchanges 
in january  the company terminated its broad based foreign currency revenue hedging program  as well as its program to hedge natural gas purchases 
all outstanding foreign currency and natural gas hedging positions related to these programs expired during however  certain business specific foreign currency hedging programs will continue  as will hedging of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
in addition  the company will continue to enter into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  investments  accounts receivable and derivatives 
as part of the company s risk management processes  it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service dupont  and monitors actual exposures versus established limits on a daily basis 
the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  derivatives  and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions 
these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed  and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 
the company s sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers 
no one individual customer balance represents more than percent of the company s total outstanding receivables balance as of december  credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic  industry and customer diversity associated with the company s global businesses 
the company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit 
as a result  it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances 
length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region 
foreign currency risk the company s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and cash flows 
the company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
in addition  option and forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of certain anticipated foreign currency raw material purchases from vendors outside of the us gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the related foreign currency denominated costs 
from time to time  the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case by case basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure  market volatility and economic trends 
forward exchange contracts are also used  from time to time  to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on three or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt 
commodity price risk the company enters into exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases 
the company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory 
under these contracts  growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest 
derivative instruments  such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity  are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers 
the company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal 
these derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk 
additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
value at risk a value at risk var analysis provides a forward looking perspective of the maximum potential loss in fair value for a defined period of time assuming normal market conditions and a given confidence level 
the company s risk management portfolio consists of a variety of hedging instruments which provide protection from volatility in the areas of interest rates  foreign currency  agricultural commodities  and energy feedstock commodities 
the valuations and risk calculations for the var analysis were conducted using the company s risk management portfolios as of december   and the average  high and low values reflected in the table were developed from each of the four quarters ended in the var analysis used a monte carlo simulation type model with a covariance matrix  and employed  pseudo random market paths including all risk factors associated with the hedging instruments in the company s risk management portfolios 
the calculations were conducted over a business day period at a percent confidence level 
the following table details the results of the var analysis for each significant risk management portfolio at the end of both and var for the entire risk management portfolio is a loss of million for  and a loss of million for  these values reflect the diversification benefits and covariance correlation of the total portfolio 
dollars in millions average high low foreign currency interest rates energy feedstock commodities agricultural commodities the table above represents the var potential loss in fair value when each risk management portfolio is valued individually 
the changes in portfolio vars in as compared to are due to increases in portfolio size  price volatility  and for interest rates  portfolio duration 
the var model results are only an estimate and are not intended to forecast actual losses that may be incurred in future periods 
since the company s risk management programs are highly effective  the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures
