we make full service veterinary care available in approximately of our stores through our strategic relationship with banfield  the pet hospital  operating under the registered trademark of banfield 
during the third quarter of  we decided to begin a national roll out of petshotel in as of january   we operated petshotels within our retail stores and one stand alone location

we also reach customers through our direct marketing channels  including petsmart 
com  one of the internet s most popular pet e commerce sites  an e commerce site dedicated to equine products and two major branded catalogs 

table of contents executive summary diluted earnings per common share increased to  on net income of million  for fiscal compared to diluted earnings per common share of on net income of million for fiscal the increase in earnings for is due to a combination of revenue gains and gross profit rate improvement  partially offset by an increase in operating  general and administrative expenses and income taxes 
net sales increased to billion for compared to billion for due to the addition of net new stores and a comparable same store sales increase of for the year 
services sales also increased over the prior year amounts 
gross margins increased basis points for fiscal compared to fiscal as we improved buying procedures and saw results from our new price optimization software  which is protecting and enhancing gross margins even as we pursue our loyalty card program 
occupancy and inventory related costs were also lower as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal operating  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in compared to of net sales in due primarily to higher insurance and repair and maintenance costs  which were partially offset by lower advertising  bonus and closed store expenses as a percentage of sales 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million  or an average price of per share  and we declared cash dividends totaling per share 
we expect to open net new stores and new petshotels in fiscal we also anticipate same store sales growth of five to six percent for capital expenditures for were million  and we anticipate spending between million and million for capital expenditures in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  reserve for closed stores  insurance liabilities and reserves and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
our stores perform physical inventories once a year  and in between the physical inventories  the stores perform cycle counts on certain inventory items 
our distribution centers and forward distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items every quarter or perform an annual physical inventory 
due to the holiday season  the majority of the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the fiscal year  but continue to perform cycle counts on certain inventory items 
therefore  as of the end of a reporting period  there will be stores with certain inventory items that have not been counted 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 

table of contents reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our retail stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
the closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
we calculate the costs for future occupancy payments  net of expected sublease income  associated with closed stores using the net present value method  at a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  over the remaining life of the lease 
judgment is used to estimate the underlying real estate market related to the expected sublease income and timing of the sublease start date  and we can make no assurances that additional charges for these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
as of january  and february   we had and stores included in our closed store reserve  of which and were under sublease agreements  respectively 
we have assumed that as of january   two additional stores will have sublease income in future periods  which represents a million reduction to the reserve 
if these sublease assumptions were extended by a year from the anticipated commencement date of the assumed sublease term  the reserve would increase by approximately million 
we closed nine stores in fiscal and seven stores in fiscal  of which one store in fiscal closed as scheduled due to its lease expiration 
the closed store reserves are as follows in thousands january  february  total remaining gross occupancy costs less expected sublease income interest costs closed store reserve insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of live pets  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately billion in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies through january   we retained the initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence 
effective february   we engaged a new insurance provider 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies with the new provider  we retain an initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence on or subsequent to february  we establish reserves for losses based on semi annual independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events  and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
during the second quarter of  we recognized additional expense as a result of an actuarial report that indicated a higher reserve requirement 
we believe the increase in the actuarial estimates was primarily due to our insurance carrier being acquired resulting in an increase in the rate at which claims are paid as well as the settlement amounts 
as of january  and february   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance policies 

table of contents income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at january  and february  were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we accrue for potential income tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated  based upon management s view of the likely outcomes of current and future audits 
our accrual for income tax contingencies is adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as amendments to existing tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
at january   we had an accrual for income tax contingencies of approximately million 
if the amounts ultimately settled with tax authorities are greater than the accrued contingencies  we must record additional income tax expense in the period in which the assessment is determined 
to the extent amounts are ultimately settled for less than the accrued contingencies  or we determine that a liability to a taxing authority is no longer probable  the contingency is reversed as a reduction of income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
in the second quarter of  we completed an analysis of our net operating loss carryovers related to our purchase of petsmart 
com in fiscal year  based on guidance issued from the internal revenue service 
as a result  we expect to utilize an additional million of net operating losses previously considered unavailable 
we recorded a total tax benefit of million in the second quarter of related to the additional net operating loss utilization 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
we believe an adequate provision for taxes has been made for all years subject to audit

gross profit gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal  from for fiscal the increase primarily reflected higher margins on product sales during fiscal compared with fiscal due to improved buying practices and the results from our price optimization software  which is protecting and enhancing gross margins even as we pursue our loyalty card program 
we also experienced lower inventory shrinkage and other inventory related expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  occupancy costs recorded in cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal these items were partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of increased fuel prices 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to for  from for the increase was primarily due to increases in workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance costs as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs in our stores in compared to the higher insurance costs were primarily due to increases in actuarial estimates for workers compensation and general liability claims 
in addition  we recognized a million expense in the second quarter of fiscal primarily for the retirement of assets and additional amortization related to store lighting replacements 
the increases were offset by lower advertising  bonus and closed store expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal we also recognized a million gain from a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of interest expense interest expense increased to million for  from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital lease obligations in income tax expense for fiscal  the million income tax expense represents an effective rate of

in  we leveraged payroll and benefits costs as well as decreased our bonus expenses compared to reductions in equipment rent  and operating expenses in the direct marketing channels also drove the decrease 
this reduction was partially offset by higher expenses associated with closed stores and the payment of a residual value guarantee on two land parcels 
we closed seven stores in fiscal  compared to four stores in fiscal the higher expense in was driven by a timing difference due to the application of sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the plan to close two of the four stores in  and the related expense recognition  took place at the end of fiscal in  we adopted sfas  which requires us to record closed store expense in the period that the store is actually closed 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for  from million for the decrease was primarily due to the retirement and conversion of our subordinated convertible notes in the first quarter of for  interest expense also included lower capital lease interest due to the expiration of certain capital lease obligations

liquidity and capital resources cash flow and balance sheet data the following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands january  february  cash and cash equivalents short term investments total we manage our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in order to fund operating requirements 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million in short term investments increased million to million during the same period 
in february  we determined that investments in auction rate securities  or ars  should be classified as short term investments 
previously  such investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents 
ars generally have long term maturities  however  these investments have characteristics similar to short term investments because at predetermined 
table of contents intervals  generally every to days  there is a new auction process 
we recorded investments in ars as of january  as short term investments and reclassified ars as of february  that were previously included in cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
cash provided by operations increased million to million in  compared with million in cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily by net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization expenses of million 
cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund growth in inventory and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
inventory increased to million at january  compared to million at february  primarily due to the net new stores in fiscal our primary long term capital requirements consist of opening new stores  reformatting existing stores  expenditures associated with equipment and computer software in support of our system initiatives  petshotel construction costs and other expenditures to support our growth plans and initiatives 
for  we incurred million in capital expenditures  compared with million for the expenditures were primarily related to new stores  remodel projects and information systems projects 
in addition  we purchased equipment during fiscal that was previously leased 
net cash used in financing activities for was million  which is comprised primarily of million for the purchase of treasury stock and million for dividends  offset by million in proceeds from the exercises of stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash used in financing activities for was million 
common stock purchase program in april  the board of directors approved a plan to purchase our common stock 
in march  the board of directors extended the term of the purchase of our common stock for an additional three years through march and increased the authorized amount of annual purchases to million 
in september  the board of directors approved a program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock through fiscal year this program replaces the march program 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million  or an average price of per share  under the march and september programs 
at january   approximately million remained available for purchase under these programs 
common stock dividends we believe our ability to generate cash allows us to invest in the growth of the business and  at the same time  distribute a quarterly dividend 
our credit facility permits us to pay dividends  so long as we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default 
during  we were not in default of our credit facility 
in fiscal  the following dividends were declared by the board of directors dividend amount stockholders of date declared per share record date date paid march  april  may  june  july  august  september  october  november  december  january  february  on march   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on may  to stockholders of record on april  common stock offering in july  we filed a registration statement on form s for a public offering of  shares of our common stock  plus an over allotment option of  shares

on august   the underwriters exercised the over allotment option and purchased  additional shares for per share  resulting in proceeds  net of underwriting fees  of approximately million 
we incurred costs associated with the offering of approximately million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements substantially all our stores are leased facilities 
we opened net new stores in fiscal generally  each new store requires capital expenditures of approximately million for fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  approximately million for inventory and approximately million for preopening costs 
we expect capital spending to be approximately million to million for  based on our current plan to open net new stores and twelve new petshotels  to fixture and equip a new warehouse in illinois  to continue our investment in the development of our information systems and to add to our services capacity with the expansion of certain grooming salons 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility and available lease financing  will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
our ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments and refinance indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
lease and other commitments operating and capital lease commitments and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and including obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property at january   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due in fiscal year and contractual obligation beyond total operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total at january   we had no long term debt other than capital lease obligations

table of contents the operating and capital lease commitment payment schedule above is shown net of estimated sublease income 
sublease income for operating and capital leases at january  is as follows in thousands sublease income thereafter letters of credit we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements and utilities 
as of january   million was outstanding under our letters of credit 
related party transactions we have an investment in mmi holdings  inc  or mmih  a provider of veterinary and other pet related services 
mmih  through a wholly owned subsidiary  medical management international  inc  or mmi  operates full service veterinary hospitals and wellness hospitals inside approximately of our stores  under the registered trademark of banfield  the pet hospital 
philip l 
francis  our chairman and chief executive officer  and robert f 
moran  our president and chief operating officer  are members of the board of directors of mmih 
our investment consists of common and convertible preferred stock 
during the second quarter of  we purchased an additional million of mmih capital stock from certain mmih stockholders  and as of january   we owned approximately of the voting stock and approximately of the combined voting and non voting stock of mmih 
we charge mmi licensing fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals  and we treat this income as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs 
we record occupancy costs as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
licensing fees are determined by fixed costs per square foot  adjusted for the number of days the hospitals are open and sales volumes achieved 
we recognized licensing fees of approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and respectively 
licensing fees receivable from mmi totaled million and million at january  and february   respectively  and were included in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
credit facility at our option  on november   we amended our credit facility to reduce the available commitment to million  extend the maturity by two years to april   and amended certain covenants 
the credit facility permits us to pay dividends  so long as we are not in default or the payment of dividends would not result in default 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all our personal property assets and certain real property 
we pay a fee to the lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the credit facility 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  however  we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements and utilities 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profit during the fourth fiscal quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses  such as advertising  could 
table of contents fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a fiscal year 
sales of certain products and services designed to address pet health needs are seasonal 
because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
finally  as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store openings and related preopening expenses  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores  and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin   consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  on january  fin requires that an entity holding a majority of the variable interest of a variable interest entity must consolidate the operations of that variable interest entity of which it is the primary beneficiary 
in  we purchased two land parcels from a structured lease financing facility 
subsequent to this purchase and also in  the structured lease financing facility was liquidated 
fin was effective for us on august  with the liquidation of the special purpose entity during  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the transition provisions apply prospectively to arrangements with vendors entered into or modified after december   do not allow for prior period reclassification  and require companies to account for all amounts received from vendors as a reduction of the cost of the products purchased unless certain criteria are met that allow companies to account for vendor funding as a reduction of related operating  general and administrative expenses 
during  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  for cooperative promotional income 
we adopted the provisions of eitf for vendor contracts entered into or modified subsequent to december   and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
under eitf  any cash consideration a company receives from a vendor as part of a certain exclusive sales incentive arrangement must be recorded in the income statement as an offset to cost of sales  and cannot be recorded as revenue  unless the company meets certain criteria 
eitf is effective for new arrangements and modifications to existing arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after november  eitf permits reclassification of prior periods for comparison purposes 
we adopted eitf on february   which resulted in a decrease in sales and a corresponding decrease in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values 
sfas r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we intend to adopt sfas r beginning in our first quarter of fiscal ending may  and intend to utilize the modified retrospective transition method  which allows the restatement of prior periods by recognizing compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of sfas in july  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means eitf 
eitf concludes that the equity method of accounting is applicable to investments in common stock and in substance common stock when the investor 
table of contents has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an investee 
eitf was applicable in the first reporting period beginning after september  we adopted eitf during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the adoption had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
other information consistent with section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  petsmart is responsible for listing the non audit services approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal by the petsmart audit committee to be performed by deloitte touche llp  our independent registered public accountants 
non audit services are defined in the law as services other than those provided in connection with an audit or a review of the financial statements of petsmart 
there were no non audit services approved by the audit committee in the fourth quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in our credit standing 
in addition  a market risk exists associated with fuel prices 
interest rate risk we have the ability to use a revolving line of credit and short term bank borrowings to support seasonal working capital needs and to finance capital requirements of the business 
there were no borrowings during fiscal or borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to  at our option 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
however  we believe that such exposure does not present a significant risk due to a relatively limited number of transactions and accounts denominated in foreign currency 
approximately million  or  of our revenues for fiscal were denominated in the canadian dollar 
transaction gains and losses on united states dollar denominated transactions are recorded within operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a new structure in our canadian subsidiary that we believe will allow us to minimize the impact of future transaction gains and losses 
we had net exchange gains approximating million in fiscal
