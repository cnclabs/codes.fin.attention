we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto found under financial statements and supplementary data  item  part ii of this report 
overview we operate through three business segments machinery  equipment services and access financial solutions 
our machinery segment designs  manufactures and sells aerial work platforms  telehandlers  telescopic hydraulic excavators and trailers  as well as an array of complementary accessories that increase the versatility and efficiency of these products for end users 
our equipment services segment provides after sales service and support for our installed base of equipment  including parts sales and equipment rentals  and sells used and remanufactured or reconditioned equipment 
our access financial solutions segment arranges equipment financing and leasing solutions for our customers primarily through third party financial institutions and provides credit support in connection with those financing and lease arrangements 
we sell our products on a global basis to equipment rental companies  construction contractors  manufacturing companies  home improvement centers  the us military  state and local municipalities and equipment distributors that resell our equipment 
approximately of our new equipment sales during fiscal and fiscal were to equipment rental companies 
demand for our equipment  parts and services is cyclical and seasonal 
factors that influence the demand for our equipment include the level of economic activity in our principal markets  north america  europe  australia and latin america  particularly as it affects the level of commercial and other non residential construction activity  prevailing rental rates for the type of equipment we manufacture  the age and utilization rates of the equipment in our rental company customers fleets relative to the equipment s useful life and the cost and availability of financing for our equipment 
these factors affect demand for our new and remanufactured or reconditioned equipment as well as our services that support our customers installed base of equipment 
demand for our equipment is generally strongest during the spring and summer months  and we have historically recorded higher revenues and profits in our fiscal third and fourth quarters relative to our fiscal first and second quarters 
fiscal results significantly outpaced fiscal driven by continued strong demand across all of our product lines and in all regions throughout the world in which we have operations  our revenues reached billion  the highest in our year history 
these record revenues reflect a increase over fiscal and a three year annualized compound growth rate of 
our operating profit for fiscal of million represents a increase over fiscal our operating profit included omniquip integration expenses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the operating profit margin also improved to from fiscal s level 
net income more than doubled to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share during fiscal we delivered this strong financial performance despite the challenge of high steel prices and component shortages that weighed heavily on our manufacturing costs throughout the year 
steel prices rose significantly in the 
table of contents spring of  substantially increasing our costs of raw materials and supplied components and reducing our profitability 
steel prices began to stabilize in the fall  but currently remain at relatively high levels 
based on our analysis of steel market price indices and forecasts  our estimate of the portion of our suppliers prices attributable to steel content  and our internal production plans  we determined that higher steel costs would add substantial incremental costs to our operations for fiscal compared to fiscal in response  we initially instituted a steel price surcharge of on all new machine orders commencing with orders received after march  we subsequently increased the surcharge to  implemented base price increases that averaged for all new machine orders shipped after january  and further increased our current steel price surcharge an additional  commencing with orders received after june  comparing our estimates of the higher steel costs year on year with the impact of our surcharges and price increases  we estimate that our net unrecovered steel cost for fiscal was approximately million  with million impacting the first quarter  million impacting the second quarter  million impacting our third quarter and million impacting our fourth quarter 
these higher costs are reflected in our gross profit margin of for fiscal compared to for fiscal our strong financial performance strengthened our balance sheet 
in march  we completed an equity offering that generated net proceeds to us of million 
using proceeds from the equity offering  we paid down million of our long term debt 
and  despite the surge in revenues  for fiscal  we reduced trade receivable days sales outstanding to from in fiscal while inventory turns improved substantially to from in fiscal economic indicators such as housing  non residential construction and interest rates in the us and our principal international markets remain aligned with conditions that stimulate demand for access equipment are conductive for growth  while international economies continue to enjoy modest recovery and growth 
in turn  we are seeing continued strong demand for our products prompted by the continuing replacement and expansion of our customers rental fleets  growth of new channels to market  and an increased focus by rental companies on selling directly to end users 
our rental company customers are enjoying sustained high utilization rates and improved rental rates  feeding the strong demand for our products 
compared to fiscal results  for fiscal  revenues from the us have increased and international revenues have risen  including a increase in european sales 
in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  we attempt to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
results of operations we reported net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal compared to net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal  and net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal earnings for fiscal included favorable currency adjustments of million compared to unfavorable currency adjustments of million for fiscal and favorable currency adjustments of million for fiscal for fiscal  our revenues were billion  up from billion for fiscal  which were up from the million reported for fiscal 
table of contents the following tables outline our revenues by segment  product  and geographic region in thousands for the years ended july years ended july  segment machinery equipment services access financial solutions a products aerial work platforms telehandlers excavators after sales service and support  including parts sales  and used and reconditioned equipment sales financial products a rentals geographic united states europe other a revenues for access financial solutions and for financial products are not the same because access financial solutions also receives revenues from rental purchase agreements that are recorded for accounting purposes as rental revenues from operating leases 
the increase in machinery segment sales from million for fiscal to billion for fiscal  or  reflects strong growth in all product lines  led by a increase in sales of aerial work platforms  a increase in sales of telehandlers and a increase in sales of excavators  primarily resulting from general economic growth in north america  reflecting positive trends in construction spending  capacity utilization and consumer confidence  growth in the european economy  higher demand in australia due to increased spending on public and private infrastructure  and increased demand in the pacific rim and latin america markets as a result of improved economic conditions 
the increase in equipment services segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally due to increased service parts sales as a result of our rental customers fleets aging and increased utilization of their fleet equipment  rebuilt equipment sales to the military and higher used machine sales as a result of improved market conditions and increased demand for used equipment 
the decrease in access financial solutions segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to a decrease in our portfolio as we continue to transition customers to our limited recourse financing arrangements originated through private label finance companies 
while we experienced decreased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables  we also experienced a corresponding decrease in our limited recourse debt 
this resulted in million less of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt 
in accordance with the required accounting treatment  the interest portion of the payments to monetization purchasers is reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in machinery segment sales from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to the additional telehandler sales from omniquip products and our 
table of contents new all wheel steer machines  and increased sales of aerial work platforms in north america  europe and australia 
after considering the increase in revenues related to the omniquip and delta acquisitions  the remaining increase in sales was the result of general economic improvements in north america reflecting positive trends in construction spending  capacity utilization and consumer confidence 
in addition  the european economy showed continued improvement  although lagging the north american economic recovery  and there was somewhat of an easing of credit availability to the rental industry 
the increase in equipment services segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was due to the additional omniquip revenues  increased service parts sales as a result of our customers fleets aging and increased utilization of fleet equipment  an increase in sales of replacement parts for our competing manufacturers equipment and higher sales of rental fleet and rebuilt equipment as a result of improved market conditions and increased demand for used equipment 
the decrease in access financial solutions segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to an early payoff of a financed receivable  partially offset by higher finance income due to a larger portfolio 
while we have increased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables  a corresponding increase in our limited recourse debt resulted in million of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt 
our domestic revenues for fiscal were billion  up from fiscal revenues of million 
the increase in our domestic revenues reflects strong growth in all product lines as a result of general economic growth in north america and increased demand for used equipment 
revenues generated from sales outside of the united states during fiscal were million  up from fiscal revenues of million 
the increase in our revenues generated from sales outside of the united states was primarily attributable to improved market conditions in the european  australian  pacific rim and latin america regions  resulting in increased sales of aerial work platforms and telehandlers 
our domestic revenues for fiscal were million  up from fiscal revenues of million 
the increase in our domestic revenues was principally due to the additional sales from omniquip products of million  as well as increased sales of aerial work platforms  telehandlers  parts  rental fleet and rebuilt equipment and excavators as a result of general economic improvements in north america 
revenues generated from sales outside of the united states during fiscal were million  up from fiscal the increase in our revenues generated from sales outside of the united states was primarily attributable to improved market conditions  resulting in increased sales of aerial work platforms in europe and australia and higher telehandler sales resulting from new product introductions in europe 
our gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in market prices of raw materials  such as steel and energy  continued manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from capacity constraints in our supplier base and a less favorable product mix 
the decrease in our gross profit margin was partially offset by the higher sales volume during fiscal  price increases and surcharges  cost reductions  productivity improvements  the favorable impact of currency and lower omniquip integration expenses 
the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to lower margins on service parts sales and a decrease in service parts sales as a percentage of total segment revenues  partially offset by improved margins on used equipment sales reflecting increased demand for used equipment 
the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in financial product revenues as we continue to transition customers to our limited recourse arrangements originated through private label finance companies 
because the costs associated with these revenues are principally selling and administrative expenses and interest expense  gross margins are typically higher in this segment 

table of contents our gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was attributable to higher margins in our equipment services and machinery segments 
the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to cost reductions associated with our capacity rationalization plan  the favorable impact of currency  the omniquip acquisition and the higher sales volume during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in our gross profit margin was partially offset by an increase in market prices of raw materials  such as steel and energy  omniquip integration expenses of million  increased freight costs due to increased production rates and expediting materials associated with steel availability and a less favorable product mix 
the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in higher margin service parts sales as a percentage of total segment revenues resulting from the additional sales from products acquired in the omniquip acquisition and improved margins on used equipment sales reflecting increased demand for used equipment 
the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in financial product revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues 
because the costs associated with these revenues are principally selling and administrative expenses and interest expense  gross margins are typically higher in this segment 
our selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the following table summarizes the changes by category in selling  administrative and product development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal in millions salaries and related benefits bonus expense advertising and trade shows incremental expenses from delta operations consulting and legal costs depreciation and amortization expense product development expenses serviceplus operations utilities pension and other postretirement benefit costs omniquip integration expenses bad debt provisions other our machinery segment s selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal due primarily to expenses associated with our delta operations  increased omniquip integration expenses  increased depreciation and amortization expense  an increase in product development expenses related to our aerial work platforms and north american and european telehandler products  an increase in costs related to advertising and trade shows  higher payroll taxes and increased medical costs and an increase in bonus expense primarily due to our increased profitability and a reclassification between segments 
partially offsetting these effects were decreases in bad debt provisions as a result of specific reserves related to certain european customers incurred during the prior year and pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
our equipment services segment s selling and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal million due primarily to expenses associated with our serviceplus operations  which we launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal  higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs and increased consulting and legal costs associated with ordinary business activities 

table of contents our access financial solutions segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal due primarily to a decrease in bad debt provisions as a result of the lower reserve needed because of the decrease in outstanding pledged finance receivables 
partially offsetting this decrease were higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs 
our general corporate selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal due primarily to higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs  increased bonus expense primarily due to our increased profitability offset in part by a reclassification between segments  increased consulting and legal costs associated with ordinary business activities  increased costs related to advertising and trade shows  and higher bad debt provisions as a result of specific reserves related to certain european customers 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in omniquip integration expenses

our access financial solutions segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal due primarily to a decrease in bad debt provisions as a result of the lower reserve needed because of the decrease in outstanding finance and pledged finance receivables and a decrease in software costs 
our general corporate selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal primarily due to management bonus accruals arising from our increased profitability  omniquip integration expenses  increase in bad debt provisions for specific reserves related to certain european customers as a result of a deterioration in their current financial position  higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs  higher consulting and legal costs associated with the financial restatement and related activity  an increase in advertising and trade show expenses  and costs associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards in january and february triggered by our share price appreciation 
even though in conjunction with our financial restatement the restricted stock awards were restored to their prior unvested status at the request of our officers  pursuant to us 
table of contents generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we are required to include the cost of the accelerated vesting in our current period expenses 
these restricted stock awards subsequently vested during fiscal during fiscal  we announced further actions related to our ongoing longer term strategy to streamline operations and reduce fixed and variable costs 
as part of our capacity rationalization plan commenced in early  we idled the  square foot sunnyside facility in bedford  pennsylvania  which produced selected scissor lift models  and we relocated that production into our shippensburg  pennsylvania facility 
additionally  reductions in selling  administrative and product development costs resulted from changes in our global organization and from process consolidations 
we have improved our european sales and service operations model by eliminating redundant operations  reducing headcount and focusing on enhancing the business for increased profitability and growth through ongoing manufacturing process improvements 
as a result  pursuant to the plan we anticipated incurring a pre tax charge of million and spending approximately million on capital requirements 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of the pre tax charge related to the idling of our bedford  pennsylvania facility  discussed above  consisting of accruals for termination benefit costs and relocation costs and charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs 
we reported  in restructuring costs and million in cost of sales 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of this pre tax charge  consisting of accruals for termination benefit costs and relocation costs and charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs and million on capital requirements 
we reported million in restructuring costs and million in cost of sales 
in addition  during fiscal  we paid and charged million of termination benefits and relocation costs against the accrued liability 
during fiscal and  we incurred and million  respectively  of the pre tax charge related to our closure of the orrville  ohio facility  consisting of production relocation costs  which were reported in cost of sales 
additionally  during fiscal  we paid and charged million of termination benefits and lease termination costs against the accrued liability 
for additional information related to our capacity rationalization plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
the decrease in interest expense of million for fiscal was primarily due to decreased interest expense associated with our limited recourse and non recourse monetizations as a result of a decrease in our limited recourse debt and the early retirement of million in principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due the notes and million principal amount of our outstanding senior unsecured notes due the notes during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal interest expense associated with our finance receivables monetizations was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest expense of million for fiscal was primarily due to interest associated with our notes that were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal and increased interest expense associated with our limited recourse debt from finance receivables monetizations 
interest expense associated with our finance receivables monetizations was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our miscellaneous income expense category included currency gains of million in fiscal compared to currency losses of million in fiscal and currency gains of million in fiscal in addition  our miscellaneous income expense category for fiscal included million of costs associated with the early retirement of debt 
the change in currency for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable realized currency gains during the year resulting from the weaker us dollar against the euro  british pound and the australian dollar  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of realized and unrealized forward exchange contracts 
the change in currency for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to our level of hedging positions as well as the expense associated with our hedging transactions 
we enter into certain foreign currency contracts  principally forward contracts  to manage some of our foreign exchange risk 
some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures 
through our foreign currency hedging activities  we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not designate our forward exchange contracts as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

for additional information related to our derivative instruments  see item a of part ii of this report and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily attributable to non deductible compensation related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards triggered by our share price appreciation and the fact that bonuses paid for fiscal were not eligible for the performance based compensation exemption because the shareholder approved plan expired at the end of fiscal  and to the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions of the internal revenue code as the benefit is being phased out through fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily attributable to the change in accounting estimate in the prior year and a change in the source of earnings among various jurisdictions with different tax rates in the current year 
for additional information related to the change in accounting estimate  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will be 
the american job creation act of the job creation act was enacted on october  among other things  the job creation act repealed an export incentive and created a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities 
we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this legislation on us 
financial condition cash generated from operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal and a use of million in fiscal the increase in cash generated from operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a smaller increase in trade receivables as compared to fiscal which was attributable to stronger collections  an increase in our net income  and an increase in accounts payable due to higher production levels as a result of the increase in demand for our products  partially offset by higher inventory levels to support the increased business activity and inefficiencies associated with component shortages 
stronger collections are principally from the results of an initiative under our six sigma program focused on improving collection processes and procedures 
the increase in cash generated from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from an increase in accounts payable largely resulting from higher production levels  fewer originations of finance receivables as a result of lower demand for customer financing and the third party program agreements we entered into during fiscal to provide financing solutions for our customers  and our increased profitability 
partially offsetting these effects were an increase in trade receivables resulting from increased sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal and higher inventory levels to support the increased business activity 
during fiscal  we used a net of million of cash for investing activities compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal our decreased use of cash for investing activities for fiscal was principally due to the omniquip acquisition that was completed during the first quarter of fiscal our increased use of cash for investing activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to the omniquip acquisition that we completed during the first quarter of fiscal and increases in our rental fleet  partially offset by higher sales of our rental fleet 
we received net cash of million from financing activities for fiscal compared to net cash received of million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by financing activities was largely attributable to our net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million during the third quarter of fiscal and proceeds from the exercise of stock options during fiscal partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the repurchase of million in principal amount of our outstanding notes  the repurchase of million in principal amount of our outstanding notes and the absence of monetizations of our finance receivables during fiscal compared to million of monetizations during fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely attributable to the sale in fiscal of our notes and fewer monetizations of our finance receivables due to the impact of prior monetizations which reduced the marketability of our remaining portfolio and the new third party program agreements we entered into during fiscal 
table of contents due to the seasonality of our sales  during certain periods we may generate negative cash flows from operations despite reporting profits 
generally  this may occur in periods in which we are building inventory levels in anticipation of sales during peak periods as well as other uses of working capital related to payment terms associated with trade receivables or other sale arrangements

c in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  operating lease obligations are not reflected in the balance sheet 
d we enter into contractual arrangements that result in our obligation to make future payments  including purchase obligations 
we enter into these arrangements in the ordinary course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of inventories  machinery and equipment  or services 
purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchase commitments  including raw materials  components and sourced products 
e we anticipate that our funding obligation for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal will approximate million 
that amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or  with respect to unfunded plans  necessary to fund current benefits 
we have not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions

on march   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us  net proceeds from this offering totaled approximately million 
on april   we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the common stock offering to purchase in the open market million in principal amount of our outstanding notes at a 
table of contents price equal to of such principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we incurred a charge of approximately million after taxes during the third quarter of fiscal relating to the extinguishment of debt and the write off of deferred financing costs resulting from the open market purchase of our notes 
the open market purchase of our notes will lower our future interest expense by million annually  and it reduced our fiscal interest expense by million 
on april   we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the common stock offering to redeem million in principal amount of our outstanding notes under an equity clawback provision that permits a redemption of up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a price equal to of such principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  at any time prior to june  we incurred a charge of approximately million after taxes during the third quarter of fiscal relating to the extinguishment of debt  net of the deferred gain on the related interest rate swap  and the write off of deferred financing costs resulting from the redemption of our notes 
the redemption of our notes will lower our future interest expense by million annually  and it reduced our fiscal interest expense by million 
on may   we used approximately million of the net proceeds from our march common stock offering to purchase in the open market million in principal amount of our notes at a price equal to of such principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we incurred a charge of approximately million after taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal relating to the extinguishment of debt and the write off of deferred financing costs resulting from the open market purchase of our notes 
the open market purchase of our notes will lower our future interest expense by million annually  and it reduced our fiscal interest expense by  on april   we completed the purchase of delta for million  which included transaction expenses of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
headquartered in tonneins  france  delta has two facilities that manufacture the toucan brand of vertical mast lifts  a line of aerial work platforms distributed throughout europe for use principally in industrial and maintenance operations 
in addition  we purchased certain intellectual property and related assets of manitowoc s discontinued product lines  which will permit us to re launch selected liftlux models 
we funded the purchase price with cash generated from operations 
on august   we completed the omniquip acquisition  which includes all operations relating to the skytrak and lull brand telehandler products 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
the purchase price was million  with million paid in cash at closing and million paid in the form of an unsecured subordinated promissory note due on the second anniversary of the closing date 
on february   we paid off the million unsecured subordinated promissory note and paid post closing purchase price adjustments in favor of textron totaling million 
in addition  we incurred million in transaction expenses 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price and the transaction expenses with remaining unallocated proceeds from the sale of our notes 
as a result of the omniquip acquisition  we anticipate funding approximately million in remaining integration expenses through july  with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect that our principal sources of liquidity for fiscal will be existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
availability of funds under our credit facilities and monetizations of finance receivables depend on a variety of factors described below 
as of july   we had cash balances totaling million and unused credit commitments totaling million 
we have a three year million senior secured revolving credit facility that expires september  and a pari passu  one year million cash management facility that expires september  both facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of our domestic assets excluding property  plant and equipment 
availability of credit requires compliance with financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain i leverage ratios during fiscal of net funded debt to ebitda as defined in the senior secured revolving credit facility and net funded senior debt to ebitda as defined in the senior secured revolving credit facility measured on a rolling four quarters not to exceed to and to  respectively  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to through october  and to through july  and iii a tangible net worth as defined in the senior secured revolving credit facility of at least million  
table of contents plus of consolidated net income as defined in the senior secured revolving credit facility on a cumulative basis for each preceding fiscal quarter  commencing with the quarter ended july  availability of credit also will be limited by a borrowing base determined on a monthly basis by reference to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and percentages ranging between and of various categories of domestic inventory 
accordingly  credit available to us under these facilities will vary with seasonal and other changes in the borrowing base and leverage ratios  and we may not have full availability of the stated maximum amount of credit at all times 
we have commenced discussions with our current bank group to amend and renew our revolving credit facility through  including features that could increase the lending commitment to million 
however  based on our current business plan  we expect to have sufficient credit available that  combined with existing cash balances and cash to be generated from operations  will meet our expected seasonal requirements for working capital  planned capital and integration expenditures for the next twelve months 
historically  our access financial solutions segment originated and monetized customer finance receivables principally through limited recourse syndications 
since late  the focus of this segment has shifted to providing private label financing solutions through program agreements with third party funding providers  subject to limited recourse to us 
transactions funded by the finance companies are not held by us as financial assets  and therefore their subsequent monetization is not recorded on our financial statements 
some transactions not funded by the finance companies may still be funded by us to the extent of our liquidity sources and subsequently monetized or they may be funded directly by other credit providers 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we monetized  million and million  respectively  in finance receivables through syndications 
during the same periods  million  million and  respectively  of sales to our customers were funded through program agreements with third party finance companies 
although monetizations generate cash  under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  the monetized portion of our finance receivables portfolio remains recorded on our balance sheet as limited recourse debt 
we expect that our limited recourse debt balance will continue to decline 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report  we are a party to multiple agreements whereby we guarantee million in indebtedness of others 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
also as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  our future results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that our ultimate exposure with respect to product liability varies from current estimates 
also as discussed in note and in item of part i of this report  pending legal proceedings and other contingencies have the potential to adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves for finance receivables we evaluate the collectibility of receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon our perception of the quality of the current receivables  the current financial position of our customers and past experience of collectibility 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 

table of contents goodwill we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in a relationship with a significant customer 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others we enter into agreements with finance companies whereby our equipment is sold to a finance company  which  in turn  sells or leases it to a customer 
in some instances  we retain a liability in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
reserves are established related to these guarantees based upon our understanding of the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if we become aware of deterioration in the financial condition of our customers or of any impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
although we may be liable for the entire amount of a customer s financial obligation under guarantees  our losses would be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment 
in addition  we have monetized a substantial portion of the receivables originated by afs through a series of syndications  limited recourse financings and other monetization transactions 
in connection with some of these monetization transactions  we have a loss exposure associated with our pledged finance receivables related to possible defaults by the obligors under the terms of the contracts  which comprise these finance receivables 
contingencies have been established related to these monetization transactions based upon the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the financial condition of these obligors were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
we discuss our guarantee agreements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
income taxes we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on a quarterly basis 
the rate determined is used in providing for income taxes on a year to date basis 
the tax effect of specific discrete items is reflected in the period in which they occur 
if the estimates and related assumptions used to calculate the effective tax rate change  we may be required to adjust our effective rate  which could change income tax expense 
we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets assumes  based on estimates and assumptions  that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the benefits of such assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities and tax planning strategies in making the assessment 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often results in proposed assessments 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings and or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain items in inventory may be considered impaired  obsolete or excess and as such  we may establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of these items to their net realizable value 
we also value used equipment taken in trade from our customers 
based on certain estimates  assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time  we determine the amounts of these inventory allowances 
if these estimates and related assumptions or the market for our equipment change  we may be required to record additional reserves 

table of contents long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
judgments made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods 
if actual fair value is less than our estimates  long lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against earnings 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculation of these amounts 
these assumptions  used by actuaries  include discount rates  expected returns on plan assets for funded plans  rates of salary increases  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  participant demographics and other factors 
we consider current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we develop the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with long term maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation 
we develop the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include the plan s targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized to future periods and therefore affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially effect our financial position or results of operations 
product liability our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the use of equipment that we rent or sell 
we maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions  primary insurance and excess insurance coverage 
we monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims 
our liability estimates with respect to claims are based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims and the reserves assigned by our independent insurance claims adjustment firm 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting accrued liability are reviewed frequently  and adjustments resulting from our reviews are reflected in current earnings 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
restructuring and restructuring related these charges and related reserves and accruals reflect estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations and asset valuations 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan within the program at the end of each reporting period or as conditions change 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from the estimates used to establish the reserves 
revenue recognition sales of non military equipment and service parts are unconditional sales that are recorded when product is shipped and invoiced to independently owned and operated distributors and customers 
normally our sales terms are free on board shipping point fob shipping point 
however  certain sales  including our all terrain lifter  army system atlas brand of military telehandler products  may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
in such cases  revenue is recognized only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the equipment  the equipment has been completed and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that we hold the equipment for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the equipment is invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the equipment and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon invoicing  the equipment is segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer  and we have no further obligations under the order other than customary post sales support activities 
during fiscal  of our sales were invoiced and the revenue recognized prior to customers taking physical possession 
in the instances that our shipping terms are shipping point destination  revenue is recorded at the time the goods reach our customers 

table of contents the sales terms for our atlas brand of military telehandler products are fob origin 
in order for us to recognize revenue  the atlas telehandler products must pass inspection by a government quality assurance representative qar at the point of production to insure adequate special paint requirements 
the sales terms of our millennia military vehicle mmv brand of military telehandler products are fob destination 
in order for us to recognize revenue  the mmv telehandler products must pass inspection by a government qar at the point of production to insure special paint requirements are met and by a government representative at the point of destination to verify delivery without damage during transportation 
revenue from certain equipment lease contracts is accounted for as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
the associated interest is recorded over the term of the lease using the interest method 
in addition  net revenues include rental revenues earned on the lease of equipment held for rental 
rental revenues are recognized in the period earned over the lease term 
we enter into rental purchase guarantee agreements rpgs with some of our customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase option at the end of the agreement 
under the terms of the rpg  the customer is obligated to purchase the equipment at the end of the rental period 
the full amount due under the agreement is recorded as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales at the inception of the agreement 
we ship equipment on a limited basis to certain customers on consignment  which under gaap allows recognition of the revenues only upon final sale of the equipment by the consignee 
at july   we had million of inventory on consignment 
warranty we establish reserves related to the warranties we provide on our products 
specific reserves are maintained for programs related to equipment safety and reliability issues 
we establish estimates based on the size of the population  the type of program  costs to be incurred by us and estimated participation 
we maintain additional reserves based on the historical percentage relationships of such costs to equipment sales and applied to current equipment sales 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
outlook our supply base has responded to our rapidly rising demand and  although still capacity constrained  is prepared to support our fiscal requirements 
additionally  we are adding some capacity  primarily for telehandler boom weldments in one pennsylvania facility and we have begun negotiations with state and local authorities concerning the potential re opening of our bedford  pennsylvania location 
we will continue to implement ongoing design and process improvements that should further expand our manufacturing capacity without adding to the footprint 
while the price of steel and other commodity inputs to our products remain high  with the exception of energy prices  they have stabilized  and as a result of our pricing actions and design and process improvements  we have recovered much of the increased costs 
with the most recent increase in customer surcharges  announced in may  going forward into fiscal  we expect to substantially recover these higher raw material costs 
more generally  commercial and non residential construction and solid economic activity  the primary drivers of equipment demand  continue to be strong 
fleet age  rental rates and utilization of our type of equipment continue to drive demand in almost all geographic regions and product lines as rental companies maintain their strong pace of equipment refreshment and expansion 
although the macro economic impacts of this year s gulf coast hurricanes are yet to be determined  we expect the short term results to be similar to last year where equipment demand rose as a result of the clean up and reconstruction activities following the florida hurricanes 
in fiscal  we will be investing in several initiatives including expansion of our serviceplus operations  development of the next generation military atlas telehandlers  as well as other product development programs targeting specific market segments 
these strategic investments will not be accretive in fiscal but they further support our long term objectives of increasing shareholder value 

table of contents absent any major economic shocks  we anticipate stronger demand in fiscal to drive global sales 
continuing improvement of component availability is also helping to drive operational efficiency gains 
and  we will continue to explore opportunities to put our available cash to work to increase shareholder value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage exposure to these risks principally through our regular operating and financing activities 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our outstanding debt 
our outstanding interest rate swap instruments at july  consisted of a million notional fixed to variable rate swap with a fixed rate receipt of and a million notional fixed to variable rate swap with a fixed rate receipt of 
the bases of the variable rates paid related to our million and million interest rate swap instruments are the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus and  respectively 
these swap agreements are designated as hedges of the fixed rate borrowings which are outstanding and are structured as perfect hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during fiscal  we terminated our million notional fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of that we entered into during june  which resulted in a deferred gain of million 
the remaining deferred gain of million will offset interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
total interest bearing liabilities at july  consisted of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at the current level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease pre tax current year earnings by approximately million on an annual basis 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
we manufacture our products in the united states  belgium and france  and sell these products in north america and europe as well as other international markets 
as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets  our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of our transactions in foreign markets are denominated 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have the effect of reducing gross profits for the year ended july  by approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not take into account potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 

table of contents we enter into certain currency forward contracts to mitigate our foreign exchange risk that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
however  we have not designated these instruments as hedge transactions under sfas no 
and  accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings 
some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures 
at july   we were managing million of foreign currency contracts 
through our foreign currency hedging activities  we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
additional information regarding our management of exposure to market risks is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report
